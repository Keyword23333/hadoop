4870040 we think the pleasant state that can be induced by music leads to special physiological changes which eventually lead to stress reduction or direct immune enhancement
4870041 stress reduction probably plays an important role but the stress reducing effect seems to be different for various types of music
4870042 wed expect that different kinds of music might show different physiological and immunological effects
4870043 listening to music in hospitals might show benefits for patients and may for example lead to shorter recovery times but we are still to test this ourselves

4870053 not everyone wants or needs to live in a 1950s ranch style home
4870054 its the physical manifestation of a variety of people doing a variety of things
4870055 we want to make a place that gains authenticity as it ages
4870056 theres nothing wrong with traditional buildings we just didnt want that to be the theme of the place
4870057 the peninsula today is not defined by this or that style its very eclectic
4870058 ive had a two week semi unknown injury in my achilles area our medical team has done so much for me since ive been here i really thought i could just step back on the track and get through it this is the olympics i had to go for it my first stride i just couldnt get on my toes i went as far as i could and i just couldnt do it
4870059 this was a policy disagreement i had with administrator johnson who is in a very difficult situation
4870060 i respect the administrator though i do disagree with the policies he has pursued
4870061 i was invited back to epa to do a job and i did all this administration wanted me to do this administration has declined to decide what to do about the profound policy challenge of global warming this administration has decided to make itself irrelevant
4870062 i do not know what motivated him to say that he suddenly realized that this administration wasnt going to do anything
4870063 nobody knows for sure why he went public and started ratting out his colleagues
4870064 he was one of the political insiders at epa people on staff at epa are stunned that hes trying to rewrite history and say that he was a good guy all along
4870065 while he and i ultimately didnt agree on the right way to set an air quality standard
4870066 he liked how i operated he liked my expertise and experience in applying economic analysis to environmental policy making
4870067 it will have legal significance requiring epa to then issue the first federal greenhouse gas regulations i believe that much of the work we did will help the next administration
4870068 it was environmentally bad and flagrantly illegal on its face
4870069 he came into a lot of ill repute at the agency during the mercury battles
4870070 he was one of the principle architects for a policy that proved to be a total disaster from an air pollution standpoint
4870071 my basic philosophy of the regulation is fairly straight forward
4870072 some regulations are quite beneficial to the well being of our country and some of them arent ive tried to apply a consistent set of principles to each inquiry
4870073 was that administrator johnson declined to provide a stronger soot standard
4870074 california has met the test of the clean air act
4870075 sure hes giving corroboration that the leader of epa is a scoundrel
4870076 but whats being done about it the career epa staff people have been keeping their heads down for seven years they figure they might as well keep them down for another five months
4870077 because hes confirming what many of us have known for years that bush and cheney have been especially disastrous on environmental matters

4870089 therefore if anyone is in christ he is a new creation the old has gone the new has come all this is from god who reconciled us to himself through christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation that god was reconciling the world to himself in christ not counting mens sins against them and he has committed to us the message of reconciliation we are therefore christs ambassadors as though god were making his appeal through us we implore you on christs behalf be reconciled to god god made him who had no sin to be sin for us so that in him we might become the righteousness of god

4870209 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4870244 ya its very teen comedy esc was hard not to say something directly to james there were a lot of things i felt were just them bowing to the mainstream whims not looking to make this movie for the fans but again this is only the first 30 or so minutes perhaps they were starting it this way to show how unimportant his life had become before the arrival of another earth endangering villain
4870245 i think this is dissapointing non faithfull to the book comic bows down to mainstream whims cheap not good ect
4870246 the movie needs some positive feedback so all the new people that hear about db dont start bashing the anime because of the movie
4870247 i am relaxing my anus for a while so many hours in front of the computer makes me sick
4870248 i am designer of moving graphics you know cgi and special effects for movies and stuff 8 me

4870252 yeah whatever its a good film go and see it
4870253 its not that theres evidence proving hes fibbing but theres lacking evidence hes telling the truth
4870254 and the pictures an easy pull from any archive as were closing in on the release date and now pictures are falling from the sky like rain
4870255 if he really was in the movie he wouldnt have vague memories of scenes and forget various character names
4870256 dude you try to put my home girl emmy rossum on blast
4870257 what do you expect your disapointing the fans by saying dragonball has bad dialogue and then you expect us not to react
4870258 there are allot of people anticipated to see this movie there have been people like myself who been waiting 6 years for this movie you try to tell us the movie has bad dialogue but you havent shown us any proof i really hope you have some evidence because right now i cant take your word for it
4870259 i think he said something about a photographer taking pictures and that one of the german extras sent him a picture but im not sure if it was that picture if you see this comment wasinthemovie i think wed all like to know
4870260 u showed us one pic so now we should belive you show us more pics and then maybe ill belive u u think that a hot hollywood actress like emma rossum was checking you out yeah right man she was probaly saw something on ur face
4870261 maybe i shouldnt say this shes gonna look so bad
4870262 i listened to your podcast and i believe u were an extra in the movie as u said i dont think someone wud spend days making up fake info gettin a decent quality new photo and other pics nowhere else in the world get interviewed on a podcast reveal information that never contradicted itself in any way and spend at least 2 3 days defending himself on the internet either u have no life or u were in the movie i believe the latter the part wid emmy tho lmao
4870263 lol have you seen the state of her new bf
4870264 i just want to know if you really like emmy why did you put her on blast like that emmy is soooo nice and seems like a beautiful person
4870265 maybe i shouldnt say this shes gonna look so bad
4870266 you act like you did me a favor im not watching the movie because of you im watching it because its dragonball and you are disapointing the fans my homie kaypain said he gives up because you said the dialogue wasnt good nanjirou and others is also disapointed because they said they believe you you are making the movie look bad dude
4870267 i believe you wasinthemovie but could you please elaborate on that fart joke it doesnt seem to make much sense and i am shocked that james wong would ever write that garbage and i appreciate you risking being sued over this thats nice of you
4870268 well i dont want to say but i heard of some evidence that changed my mind since then
4870269 wasinthemovie unfortunately i believe you but i really wish you were full of crap i think its the same for most of the people who say they don t believe you they don t want to believe you but deep inside they do if they don t its because they didn t hear the podcast anyway most of us would really appreciate it if you could expand on your experience while you where there http www myspace com coreywilson10 don t get mad at him mate he is just giving his honest opinion on what he saw its just the highschool part the rest of the movie will be amazing i ve no doubt about that its just that for this to be the masterpiece i want it to be even the highschool stuff should be very good and it seems it may not be
4870270 you freakin type to much your also boring the hell out of me

4870273 hijole alright it looks like you made your point lol unfortunately i too believe you judging by your long elaborate comeback comments to others on this message board it looks like you were in the movie its just that a lot of the recent news was generally positive and got everyone so pumped for this movie and all of a sudden some unfavorable unexpected news comes up then a lot of people were in denial but im sure mostly everyone believes you by now also if you had the balls to reveal this news with the possibility of being sued then maybe emmy was checking you out lol but seriously dont lay a finger on her
4870274 im really interested in knowing if that ben ramsey script i posted up in the comments is real
4870275 this is the best comment section in the history of the internet

4870301 the main theme of the video is the human element of forgiveness and someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was metallica plugging into a modern war or a current event that might be construed as some sort of political statement on our part there are so many celebrities that soapbox their opinions and people believe its more valid because theyre popular

4870432 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4870433 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4870451 the definition of geek has changed considerably over time and there is no longer a definitive meaning
4870452 a bright young man turned inward poorly socialized who felt so little kinship with his own planet that he routinely traveled to the ones invented by his favorite authors who thought of that secret dreamy place his computer took him to as cyberspace somewhere exciting a place more real than his own life a land he could conquer not a drab teenagers room in his parents house

4870460 sometimes you can start pressing too much and in golf pressings not really good to do youve got to let the birdies happen let the putts go in you cant really force them in i think its easy to get agitated the day after you made everything
4870461 where we are and where carl is even if carl stumbles and falls back its still going to take a low number sunday for somebody to win the tournament
4870462 i had so many chances today but i just didnt convert the putts like i did yesterday
4870463 ive played that hole terrible all week so ill just keep the trend going
4870464 at that point i got a sense that carl was still putting the pedal to the metal
4870465 so i had to make some more birdies i got back in the hunt

4870470 it has become apparent once again that this board and the taxpayers of this district have been left in potentially a very costly legal position by very bad advice very bad decisions
4870471 it is indeed a sickening compromise that we have to make because of the dollars that come out of our classrooms which benefit our kids
4870472 the only thing i can think of that would be worse than that would be having to take even more from them
4870473 i dont believe its a chance we can afford to take
4870474 the leadership that has got us to this point and the mistakes that arguably were made
4870475 two of the buildings are historically designated and it was important to us as a family that we do something that will enhance their designation
4870476 we decided that one of the things downtown needed was a an event center its a historic building old red brick for the outside and from the inside it is a very modern building because we had redone it about 10 years ago
4870477 you can almost create anything you want out of it used it for anything weddings bar mitzvahs business corporate outings its an extremely flexible facility
4870478 everyone talks about bringing life to downtown i consider an event center which could literally have an event every day of the week doing that
4870479 from our perspective it goes along with what were trying to do make downtown phoenix truly a destination
4870480 that which when you stop believing in it doesnt go away

4870486 they can provide us copies of their transaction logs photographs of the items sold photographs of the suspects who sold it and they might actually have the property on their site so we can sometimes get it back to owners
4870487 you dont want them in the gangs i was going the wrong way too before i started coming here

4870490 one of the biggest concerns in this area is the gang problem this place helps address that the business community has been very vocal about that issue i know the economy is bad but they need to invest in this
4870491 if theyre going to get this service for free they have to do something
4870492 i was a whole lot bigger than i am now but i fell in love with the place
4870493 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4870494 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
4870495 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4870496 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4870497 when we arrived the news came that gori was being shelled

4870524 yes saudi intelligence chief prince muqrin bin abdul aziz did visit pakistan on friday and met senior government officials
4870525 the main purpose of the visit was to find an amicable solution to the impeachment issue and that no one should become a laughing stock

4870529 it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry
4870530 open skies has shown that other airlines are able to get slots and terminal facilities at heathrow
4870531 despite the rhetoric from those opposed to our alliance this is a competitive contested market all we want now is a level playing field with the other airline alliances that have already been given the go ahead
4870532 we want to be in a position where we are indifferent to which airline is operating the flight
4870533 just because this might be bad for richard branson doesnt mean it is bad for british consumers or the british economy in fact it is good for consumers and the economy
4870534 ba and american would have a combination of a trans atlantic network that could not be replicated and a frequentflyer programme that would make it impossible for other carriers to compete for time sensitive corporate or business travellers the alliance partners will be able to use their leverage on routes where there is little or no competition to tie in consumers on routes where there are plenty of other alternatives this would inevitably lead to a reduction of choice and higher prices for consumers
4870535 there is no logic to our having to pay any price in terms of slots
4870536 pensions are a big problem for women of my age i started work when i was 19 but didnt start saving for a pension until i hit my 40s

4870567 missile defense washington and poland just moved the world closer to war
4870568 the signing now insures an escalation of tensions between russia and nato and a new cold war arms race in full force it is important for readers to understand the ability of one of two opposing sides to put anti missile missiles to within 90 miles of the territory of the other in even a primitive first generation anti missile missile array gives that side virtual victory in a nuclear balance of power and forces the other to consider unconditional surrender or to pre emptively react by launching its nuclear strike before 2012
4870569 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe is aimed at the russian federation
4870570 us troops on monday july 14 began military exercises near the russian border in ex soviet ukraine and were poised to launch them in georgia amid tense relations between moscow and washington a ceremony inaugurating the sea breeze 2008 nato exercise was held off ukraines black sea coast against anti nato protests and a hostile reaction from officials in russia sea breeze 2008 includes forces from armenia azerbaijan belgium britain canada denmark france georgia germany greece latvia macedonia and turkey the us georgia joint exercises will be held at the vaziani military base less than 100 kilometers 60 miles from the russian border with a total of 1 650 servicemen taking part
4870571 this is a formula for an injection of us military and naval forces into georgia of indeterminate scope and duration it will certainly involve the presence of hundreds if not thousands of uniformed us military personnel on the ground and a substantial number of warships in the region the us is introducing this military force into a situation that remains highly unstable and combustible raising the possibility of a direct military clash between the united states and russia

4870720 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
4870721 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
4870722 as soon as the storm passes through people are going to want to rent mopeds
4870723 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
4870724 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
4870725 i told him if he allowed turbines in that field he would lose a son
4870726 i tell people its not a wind farm its an industrial development
4870727 we knew we were going to change the landscape maybe forever
4870728 we knew some people would be unhappy but the benefits far outweighed the objections of a few
4870729 im an educator not a wind expert or an investor

4870731 this cow doesnt need to be fed doesnt need a vet doesnt need a place to lie down
4870732 this project was happening like it or not and you would have to be a fool not to participate to be excited and take advantage of it
4870733 it seemed like the cost in terms of how it changed the community was too high
4870734 its hard when change is for the common good but some people suffer more than others

4870736 se da cuenta de un oficio del ayuntamiento de teruel por la que ha nombrado hijo adoptivo de dicha capital al excelent simo se or general don francisco franco bahamonde tanscribi ndose esta propuesta a los ayuntamientos de capitales de provincia que se hallen liberadas para que aquellos lo hagan a su vez a los pueblos de las mismas los gestores se adhieren con todo entusiasmo a la propuesta anterior y acuerdan adem s nombrar hijo adoptivo de granada al ilustre general franco
4870737 yo tampoco lo sab a pero no podemos permitir que el caudillo en plena democracia siga siendo hijo adoptivo de la ciudad granada tiene que otorgar t tulos honor ficos a quienes contribuyen al bien de la ciudad
4870738 es hora de retar al pp en primer lugar a que pida disculpas por todo lo que dijo de la financiaci n de catalu a prevista en su estatuto de autonom a y en segundo lugar que retire el recurso al estatuto en el tribunal constitucional
4870739 sucede que todav a no hay un acuerdo sobre c mo debe cumplirse esa previsi n del estatuto el gobierno tiene una idea que todav a no es compartida aunque buscamos el m nimo com n denominador posible que haga viable cumplir con las previsiones del estatuto y mejorar la financiaci n de las comunidades aut nomas
4870740 los partidos de catalu a se cuestionaran el apoyo a los presupuestos
4870741 que se aprueben los presupuestos es la garant a de que se puede abordar un nuevo modelo de financiaci n si no hay presupuestos nuevos no habr un nuevo modelo de financiaci n por lo tanto catalu a saldr perdiendo igual que el resto de comunidades aut nomas
4870742 no se ponga ni una urna en ning n pueblo remoto del pa s vasco

4870751 no me den las gracias porque me da pena estamos cumpliendo un compromiso una deuda hist rica
4870752 durante 100 a os el petr leo venezolano fue a norteam rica para alimentar el expansionismo imperialista por eso dec a que estamos pagando una deuda nunca les dimos una gota de petr leo a nuestros hermanos suramericanos o caribe os o centroamericanos

4870755 hes had a great week of practice at that position hes a 205 pound guy who can run and hit you and has great ball skills hes made the transition pretty well thus far
4870756 hes been playing corner since hes been here hes helping our team out hes getting used to it and adjusting
4870757 hes clearing up some personal things right now but i expect him to be back
4870758 that relentlessness that rod has we need that when he comes back were going to accept him with open arms im praying that he does come back
4870759 weve repped a couple of different people at no 3 quarterback and thought we needed to get him out there and see if he could take a snap and run the offense
4870760 he completed a pass so thats a positive he shot that thing in there
4870761 this is the first time hes done it hes a good athlete he played quarterback in high school
4870762 i dont ever feel like im on schedule in fact im a half hour late for lunch
4870763 as a coach youre constantly looking at things and trying to critique it you never really know i think what weve tried to do is hit every situation possible i know that were doing that from how we come out to warm up to two minute drill almost every day and different situations
4870764 thats the nature of two a days to have guys nicked up and out for two or three days
4870765 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4870766 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4870767 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4870768 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4870769 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4870770 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
4870771 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also

4870790 the united states took a series of steps that emboldened georgia sending advisers to build up the georgian military including an exercise last month with more than 1 000 american troops pressing hard to bring georgia into the nato orbit
4870791 it is curious but not surprising how the bush administration and its allies have now found renewed respect for international law in the caucasus but not when it comes to 1 the united states invading afghanistan and iraq while threatening to attack iran 2 israel invading lebanon and palestine attacking syria and threatening to attack iran 3 ethiopia invading somalia 4 colombia attacking ecuador etc from an international law perspective the real issue here is whether during her trip to tbilisi a month ago u s secretary of state rice gave the proverbial green light to georgia to attack south ossetia and thus deliberately provoke an overreaction by russia and how does this fit in with the u s u k naval armada currently steaming for the persian gulf and possible military confrontation with iran over its right to engage in nuclear enrichment under the nuclear non proliferation treaty
4870792 the costs of war international law the un and world order after iraq
4870793 i am above all astounded by the mainstream medias failure to take proper note of the pipleline geopolitics that infuses the russian moves with their global significance
4870794 on a wider front washingtons effort to penetrate the russian sphere of influence in central asia by seeking to promote nato membership for georgia and ukraine together with the intended deployment of a missile defense system in east europe undoubtedly helped tip the scales in moscow one can imagine the u s outrage if russia reacted similarly to american interventions in cuba or panama even so the russian recourse to force across an international boundary is a challenge to the core principle of international law and to the un charter this is not a defensive use of force and from an international law perspective should be challenged and censured
4870795 at the same time it pales in significance if compared to analogous u s behavior especially the 2003 unprovoked and unlawful aggression against iraq at this point what is needed in georgia is for the russians to withdraw and for the un to establish a peacekeeping presence in south ossetia and abkhasia capable of protecting the human rights and autonomy of these two societal entities until some sort of internationally monitored referendum can serve as the basis for self determination in both places to revive cold war rhetoric of the free world in relation to georgia as bush did in his statement on the crisis is one more instance of monumental irresponsibility by the president and orwellian in its implication that georgia was a democracy respectful of human rights

4870825 there were a number of candidates to sing the song and the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
4870826 you have to make sure the performance and the song are at the highest level it is a casting or a technical decision by the producer
4870827 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same

4870829 i think maybe on this one some people would believe that maybe it was not appropriate but the others would have said its fantastic because the performance was great thats what it is in sport and in life
4870830 we were very pleased with its outcome of one of the most complicated events to organise in the world
4870831 later it was discovered that she had no musical talent
4870832 they made us sign and chop a document saying we would not allow black people in during the olympics
4870833 but no one is willing to say so because well all get deported and have our business shut
4870834 we simply cant let them in during the olympics its what i was told
4870835 its the restrictions on blacks definitely happening it will all happen in 24 hours
4870836 they local police call meetings and everyone has to go or else if you dont go theyll come back and shut you down
4870837 black guys can come in and drink as long as they have valid visas
4870838 but we have been told to watch out for black guys acting suspiciously such as constantly talking on their mobile phones the aim is to crack down on drug dealing
4870839 if this is policy then it is a very bad policy more so for a country holding an olympics
4870840 uniformed public security bureau officers came into the bar recently and told me not to serve black people or mongolians
4870841 i understand that the government is trying to stop certain illegal activities but i dont think blanket discrimination is going about it the right way
4870842 chinese people are prejudiced but i would have hoped that the government would set a better example as it debuts on the world stage
4870843 the officials told me to inform my customers that they must at all times carry their passports or id cards
4870844 security is important but beijing is becoming a fortress and thats not attractive
4870845 the local police told us to get rid of the tables because theyre scared that if too many foreigners congregate outside there could be trouble
4870846 the whole music scene is angry and bewildered it is impossible to understand how keeping tourists from seeing an open culturally vibrant and diverse beijing is possibly a good thing for anyone
4870847 it appears the local government is trying to control every aspect of the experience that foreigners get when they come here
4870848 everything is aimed at creating stability but they dont understand that is precisely the unfounded prejudice that foreigners have of chinese society that it is a highly controlled and not a very cultural place it seems completely self defeating
4870849 width of the nose and the length of the face
4870850 it is a tradition in china that at events costumes of the different ethnic groups are worn to symbolize that they live together peacefully and in happiness

4870853 chen revealed that because yang peiyis teeth are coming in
4870854 treinta hombres hicieron un esfuerzo sobrehumano para levantar el veh culo permitiendo milagrosamente salvar al beb antes de la muerte de la madre
4870855 i have given this whole thing some thought and i feel it is inappropriate for pastor warren to host this at his church
4870856 i dont think he should have charged so much for the tickets the way the tickets were handled has upset a lot of people
4870857 warren is concerned about the poor but who is he pandering to warren has a global outreach which is fine for him but i feel most of the voters are more concerned about taxes the economy the energy crises the war and immigration yes character and morals are important in the president
4870858 i dont think this forum will reveal anything we havent already heard from the candidates
4870859 my experience with mr warren is that he is much the showman and will not jeopardize his favorable public reputation by asking a question that is difficult for either candidate to answer in a way that is acceptable to the audience dont expect mr obama 1 do you favor same sex marriage 2 do you favor partial birth abortion 3 why would you now vote against the surge even knowing as you do now that it succeeded 4 why do you reluctantly support oil drilling after rejecting it before 5 why do you oppose nuclear energy 6 why do you oppose shale extraction 7 why do you seek socialist solutions to social security and medicare in a capitalist country 8 why would you support issuing licenses to illegal aliens when that violates the attempt of the federal government to prevent aiding and harboring illegal aliens 9 why do you oppose allowing parents vouchers and choices in schools 10 if the people of iraq are worse off now than before why are they not rebelling against the existing duly elected government and seeking to reestablish the baathist regime mr mccain 1 at what point do you think corporate success that has violated no civil or criminal law nevertheless deserves to be punished 2 after the failure of diplomacy would you favor military action by this country to overthrow a repressive foreign regime would you join other nations that would engage in such action 3 do you think it is worth risking the security of the social security and medicare systems by having them convert to privatization merely because it rejects socialistic principles in favor of the free market 4 do you believe there is a difference in the personal relationship of gays and lesbians who are married and those of a man and a woman that justifies the prohibition of the former 5 if you believe a primary reason for energy independence is to relieve us of foreign interests then would you oppose allowing states the right to oppose drilling nuclear programs etc 6 do you believe the issue of abortion is a federal constitutional issue or one that should be resolved by states 7 would you advocate school choice even if it meant the elimination of the public school system 8 is there a defined point where the interests of the public to save a private institution outweighs the interests of the free market to police itself against inefficient enterprises if so can you define that point or is it a purely political concept 9 would you permit whatever means of interrogation that is necessary of a captured person known to have information that would save a major city from certain destruction 10 the supreme court has ruled that enemy combatants are entitled to be tried by american courts in the usa because of the strict rules of evidence employed it is likely many if not all will be acquitted what would you do with those who are acquitted if anything would you permit them the rights of citizenship and allow them to live in this country
4870860 i just want to hear what they both have to say this is unprecedented this has never been done
4870861 i dont think we got a good choice either way im not happy with either one of them
4870862 i want somebody just to be human and real i just want to see somebody bust out and be real be honest be yourself thats what im looking for im just tired of the political spin
4870863 i believe it will be more revealing than debates because i believe a pastor has a much better feel for the people than do most media anchors
4870864 why would it be an inappropriate use of a church bulding arent churches included in the constitution besides that has never stopped the democrats in the past is it somehow ok for democrats but not for republicans liberals but not for conservatives
4870865 that will depend on how the candidate answers the question if either one tries to dodge the questions it will work to his disadvantage for sure
4870866 i doubt if this is a revealing kind of event
4870867 i do not believe this format and moderator are overdue i believe rick warren has his nose where it should not be
4870868 im not crazy about the format and i am vehement in my disapproval of the moderator
4870869 with all due respect i do not believe political events should be moderated or staged by any religious group or individual i would prefer a location such as a community center with a moderator who would probably be more objective and definitely not a minister or any other religious leader
4870870 it seems to me that more and more separation of church and state is becoming a memory
4870871 even though im a secularist im appalled to see a house of god being used for political expediency wwjd hed throw the moneylenders politicians and lobbyists out and pastor warren would more than likely receive a strongly worded answer to a prayer the church is here to support the community not to allow its leaders egos to insist that our countrys leaders follow a right wing agenda
4870872 at first i was concerned that it might turn out to be a bullseye on obamas back

4870880 i think ebay completely failed in the actual process of implementing those changes

4870882 specifically buyers can be found guilty of feedback extortion but the negative feedback left for the seller will not be removed and buyers who do not pay for an item can still leave undeserved negative feedback as long as they simply state that they sent payment in the mail even if the seller accepts paypal only
4870883 i am pleased to hear that the house is on a path to vote on energy legislation that is very similar to my comprehensive plan to lower gas prices increase drilling and invest in renewable energy and i look forward to seeing a final bill
4870884 my energy plan calls for offshore drilling with states consent and requires oil to remain in america invests in renewable energy to create a new energy economy in nevada releases oil from the strategic petroleum reserve to bring down prices immediately ends 18 billion in tax giveaways to big oil and cracks down on speculation all pieces that are expected to be part of the house bill

4870886 this was a chance to honor these airmen a truly significant group with a significant event in the southern tier
4870887 we had a unit that was second to none and that was because of the pride and the intent that people would not ridicule you all your life that you were not capable of doing anything
4870888 flying is behind us thats not the mission the mission today is to keep the legacy of the tuskegee airmen alive you cant do very much about what happened but what you can do is make sure that our youth have some appreciation of the sacrifice

4870915 thirty six percent of respondents overall said it is very likely or somewhat likely that federal officials either participated in the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon or took no action to stop them because they wanted the united states to go to war in the middle east
4870916 68 percent of all germans felt the media had not reported the full truth behind the attacks

4871138 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4871139 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4871140 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4871141 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4871142 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental

4871144 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4871145 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4871146 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4871147 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4871148 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4871149 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4871150 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4871151 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4871152 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4871153 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4871154 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4871155 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos
4871156 celebrar n consultas y cooperar n de buena fe con los pueblos ind genas interesados por conducto de sus propias instituciones representativas a fin de obtener su consentimiento libre e informado antes de aprobar cualquier proyecto que afecte a sus tierras o territorios y otros recursos particularmente en relaci n con el desarrollo la utilizaci n o la explotaci n de recursos minerales h dricos o de otro tipo
4871157 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
4871158 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4871159 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4871160 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

4871163 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4871164 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
4871165 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
4871166 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
4871167 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
4871168 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
4871169 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
4871170 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
4871171 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
4871172 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
4871173 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
4871174 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
4871175 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
4871176 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n

4871179 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
4871180 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4871181 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4871182 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
4871183 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
4871184 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
4871185 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
4871186 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

4871192 this is the first case that ive seen in my 12 years in a situation where you have patients with legitimate and serious problems who are receiving a drug that is not authorized by the food drug and administration

4871195 mama this is the first time i have been pain free this medicine just might really help me
4871196 this is a wonderful medicine used appropriately but an unforgiving medicine used inappropriately
4871197 many legitimate patients following the direction of the doctor have run into trouble with methadone including death
4871198 methadone is an extremely difficult drug to use even for specialists people were using it rather blithely for several years
4871199 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
4871200 this could unequivocally cause death in patients who have not recently been using narcotics
4871201 we would have no reason to suspect that the dosing regimen
4871202 as soon as we became aware of deaths due to misprescribing for pain patients we began the process of instituting label changes
4871203 i dont think a drug that requires such a level of sophistication to use is what id call cheap because of the risks
4871204 given the medicines he was on his brain forgot to tell his heart to beat and his lungs to pump
4871205 i never had any idea of the risk nor did my husband
4871206 we know that a significant share of the methadone deaths involve doctors making well intended prescriptions
4871207 methadone can be important for patients when other drugs dont work
4871208 but unless the doctor has the training and resources to manage the patient properly hes going to get in trouble at a rate thats unacceptable

4871224 apraz me registar a qualidade do jogo foi um jogo de muito boa qualidade e grande intensidade
4871225 em cinco ganharmos quatro e n o sofrer golos tr s delas ganhas a uma equipa campe tem que ter algum m rito n o pode ser s o factor sorte
4871226 uma vit ria justa mas talvez o resultado mais justo fosse a diferen a m nima
4871227 o porto esta noite foi infeliz nunca foi inferior ao sporting mas nunca tivemos a felicidade de fazer o golo o sporting foi mais eficaz e ganhou
4871228 cometemos erros que n o costume e o porto a perder n o foi t o calmo perdemos o tino e a organiza o mas aceita se pela forma como aconteceu
4871229 aquilo que o sporting tem de fazer no campeonato muito mais do que o que fez no ano passado aquilo que fizemos em 2005 2006 e em 2006 2007 que lutar pelo t tulo at s ltimas jornadas

4871233 para tirar a diferen a depois de uma eventual derrota ficaria quase imposs vel nosso pensamento de decis o para tirar esses pontos de diferen a temos de recuperar os pontos que deixamos escapar no morumbi

4871236 so miss johnson what have you done to improve the lives of people in your community under the age of six
4871237 i see here that you were a brownie troop leader very good very good indeed how do you think your experience as a brownie leader will help you when the bus shows up at school for a field trip you forgot to cancel how does this kind of leadership help the school secretary who set the trip up and who is in charge of all the money you never gave her what kind of food can you leave on her desk to make her understand how truly sorry you are
4871238 of course you are a proud american sir when you travel how do you present yourself to others would you say you were the camera wearing map reading backpack lugging loud speaking version of an american or would you say you represented the quiet thoughtful still water running deep kind of american who speaks or hears no evil who walks everywhere because they cant figure the money out and who keeps ordering the same food all the time because its the only one you know what plan do you have to convince the rest of the world they should be like us or at least put written stuff in english

4871241 geographer hans joachim fuchs in the western german city mainz has another idea he wants to harness the power of cold mountain winds so called kabatic winds or streams of cold dense air that flow downhill with windscreens the screens would keep the cool air on top of the glaciers perhaps preserving them for a little while longer fuchs has been proposing this idea for years and this week hes putting it to the test on monday fuchs and 27 students headed to the rhone glacier in switzerland to install a windscreen measuring 15 meters long 50 feet and 3 meters high at an elevation of 2 300 meters 7 545 feet on the leading edge of the glacier hell be measuring the effectiveness of the screen to see if its a viable solution

4871249 we ask for your thoughts and prayers to surround the collins family in this time of grief funeral arrangements are pending in flomaton alabama

4871256 love means the body the soul the life the entire being we feel love as wefeel the warmth of our blood we breathe love as we breathe air we hold it inourselves as we hold our thoughts nothing more exists for us

4871258 porsche blockiert eine einigung seit zw lf monaten wenn herr wiedeking seine blockadepolitik nicht aufgibt gibt es auch keine gespr che mehr
4871259 diese position teilt auch mein kollege berthold huber uneingeschr nkt
4871260 wenn porsche sich nicht bewegt und zusagt dass es nderungen in diesen punkten gibt dann wird es keine friedensgipfel geben
4871261 wir drehen uns wegen der starren haltung des porsche vorstands seit zw lf monaten im kreis wir konzentrieren uns jetzt erstmal auf den rechtsweg und den erhalt unseres vw gesetzes
4871262 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4871263 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4871264 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4871265 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4871266 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4871267 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4871268 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4871269 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4871270 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4871271 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4871272 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4871273 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4871274 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4871275 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4871276 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4871277 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4871278 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4871279 a little yes but tomorrow i can lose in the final so i have to keep going
4871280 today i think tommy was a little more tired than me and i played well i have won a lot of matches beat a lot of good players and got a lot of confidence
4871281 tomorrow is the most important match i have to play the final like it is my last
4871282 unless you get off to a really hot start you kind of feel like youre behind the 8 ball
4871283 sometimes you can start pressing too much and in golf pressings not really good to do youve got to let the birdies happen let the putts go in you cant really force them in i think its easy to get agitated the day after you made everything
4871284 where we are and where carl is even if carl stumbles and falls back its still going to take a low number sunday for somebody to win the tournament
4871285 i had so many chances today but i just didnt convert the putts like i did yesterday
4871286 ive played that hole terrible all week so ill just keep the trend going
4871287 at that point i got a sense that carl was still putting the pedal to the metal
4871288 so i had to make some more birdies i got back in the hunt
4871289 i told my caddie if i made this i would get in the bunker and do a snow angel
4871290 i shot 28 on the back nine he does something like that the tournament is out of reach
4871291 if he can be friendly and make a bunch of pars it would leave a lot of people back in it
4871292 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4871293 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4871294 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4871295 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4871296 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4871297 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4871298 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4871299 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4871300 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4871301 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4871302 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4871303 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4871304 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4871305 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4871306 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4871307 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4871308 6 your business ill be quite frank with you i have some information to believe that you were behind centralpips com which was a scam but i am definitely not sure about it
4871309 its sad too that anyone who speaks out against felix by posting an opinion of his services online gets greeted with emails of how the fbi is going to come and get them

4871331 this is felix writing and if you know me you should know by now that i dont throw empty words into thin air
4871332 im up 1500 pips so far from july 15 2007
4871333 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4871334 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4871335 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4871336 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4871337 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4871338 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4871339 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4871340 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4871341 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4871342 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4871343 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4871344 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4871345 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4871346 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4871347 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4871348 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4871349 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4871350 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4871351 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4871352 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4871353 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4871354 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4871355 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4871356 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4871357 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4871358 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4871359 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4871360 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4871361 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4871362 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4871363 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4871364 never one to be shy about tackling the so called
4871365 it shows girls you got to do something really naughty to get noticed
4871366 what kind of message of confusion does this send to kids
4871367 when i was growing up i was enamored with this one friend
4871368 she had the most beautiful complexion and skin and strawberrylike lips
4871369 i kissed a girl and i liked it the taste of her cherry chapstick
4871370 you know what i aint gonna try to change my parents
4871371 katy perry is tired of girls wanting to kiss her
4871372 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
4871373 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
4871374 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire
4871375 barack obama is going to be saying i know what i am talking about in foreign policy and im nuanced enough that i am not going shooting from the hip the way john mccain does
4871376 living should not be a habit it should be an experience
4871377 spartiates et indignes du parlement si dans ce lieu de d bat on ne peut plus inviter des grandes voix cest d plorable

4871391 because you had a choice distress or success you chose to distress so you deserve what you choose you always do thats the gift
4871392 president medvedev informed members of the security council of the russian federation that he had signed the document on principles for resolving the conflict kremlin spokeswoman natalya timakova told afp
4871393 we dont know whats happening said one georgian police officer in the area who declined to give his name
4871394 ask the russians they are not following the agreement what do they want here
4871395 armed gangs of the abkhazian separatist regime together with units of the russian regular army shifted the administrative border of abkhazia towards the enguri river the ministry said in a statement
4871396 they are staying and have no plans to withdraw said georgias interior ministry spokesman shota utiashvili
4871397 i want to go to gori ive left my family there i am bringing food for them but they wont let me pass he said
4871398 absolutely dramatic and little aid was getting through to hungry inhabitants

4871400 were getting bodies mutilated eyes gouged arms severed georgian health minister alexander kvitashvili alleged in tbilisi im horrified i dont know if its russians or mercenaries doing it
4871401 we are constantly encountering various problems with the georgian side and it will depend how quickly and effectively this problem will be solved he complained
4871402 now russia needs to honour the agreement and withdraw its forces he added from his ranch in crawford texas adding that abkhazia and south ossetia would remain part of georgia
4871403 they can become obsessed with protecting the revenue and miss the bigger picture of creating a more productive and globally competitive tax system
4871404 some in the ato see the international tax reforms of the past six years as the devils spawn and talk about rescuing the system and saving the governments revenue flows
4871405 its the sound of the police you hou its the sound that i miss you hou
4871406 as they wished decision witheld they decided that i neednt to bother they liked me too much
4871407 but you said you are belgian it is your belgians who have brought this rule here

4871436 mccains weakness is that hes always been for the use of force force and more force in my experience the only time to use force is as a last resort
4871437 if the provocations continue tomorrow could i repeat the gesture made at the olimpico in turin yes certainly
4871438 the game with juventus is not a real game because it not an official match
4871439 but its an important tournament because it bears the name of the father of our president and given the vicissitudes of our earlier friendlies we will try to do well against a team in good shape

4871445 man is nothing else than his plan he exists only to the extent that he fulfills himself he is therefore nothing else than the ensemble of his acts nothing else than his life
4871446 circumstances have been against me what ive been and done doesnt show my true worth to be sure i have had no great love no great friendship but that because i havent met a man or woman who was worthy the books ive written havent been very good because i havent had the proper leisure i havent had children to devote myself to because i didnt find a man with whom i could have spent my life so there remains within me unused and quite viable a host of propensities inclinations possibilities that one wouldnt guess from the mere series of things ive done
4871447 well thats what were like no one can do anything about it

4871467 you will not be able to deny that the regime forced upon the nation is unworthy of cubas history in his book the spirit of laws which is the foundation of the modern division of governmental power montesquieu makes a distinction between three types of government according to their basic nature the republican form wherein the whole people or a portion thereof has sovereign power the monarchical form where only one man governs but in accordance with fixed and well defined laws and the despotic form where one man without regard for laws nor rules acts as he pleases regarding only his own will or whim and then he adds a man whose five senses constantly tell him that he is everything and that the rest of humanity is nothing is bound to be lazy ignorant and sensuous as virtue is necessary to democracy and honor to a monarchy fear is of the essence to a despotic regime where virtue is not needed and honor would be dangerous the right of rebellion against tyranny honorable judges has been recognized from the most ancient times to the present day by men of all creeds ideas and doctrines it was so in the theocratic monarchies of remote antiquity in china it was almost a constitutional principle that when a king governed rudely and despotically he should be deposed and replaced by a virtuous prince the philosophers of ancient india upheld the principle of active resistance to arbitrary authority they justified revolution and very often put their theories into practice one of their spiritual leaders used to say that an opinion held by the majority is stronger than the king himself a rope woven of many strands is strong enough to hold a lion the city states of greece and republican rome not only admitted but defended the meting out of violent death to tyrants in the middle ages john salisbury in his book of the statesman says that when a prince does not govern according to law and degenerates into a tyrant violent overthrow is legitimate and justifiable he recommends for tyrants the dagger rather than poison saint thomas aquinas in the summa theologica rejects the doctrine of tyrannicide and yet upholds the thesis that tyrants should be overthrown by the people martin luther proclaimed that when a government degenerates into a tyranny that violates the laws its subjects are released from their obligations to obey his disciple philippe melanchton upholds the right of resistance when governments become despotic calvin the outstanding thinker of the reformation with regard to political ideas postulates that people are entitled to take up arms to oppose any usurpation no less a man that juan mariana a spanish jesuit during the reign of philip ii asserts in his book de rege et regis institutione that when a governor usurps power or even if he were elected when he governs in a tyrannical manner it is licit for a private citizen to exercise tyrannicide either directly or through subterfuge with the least possible disturbance the french writer fran ois hotman maintained that between the government and its subjects there is a bond or contract and that the people may rise in rebellion against the tyranny of government when the latter violates that pact about the same time a booklet which came to be widely read appeared under the title vindiciae contra tyrannos and it was signed with the pseudonym stephanus junius brutus it openly declared that resistance to governments is legitimate when rulers oppress the people and that it is the duty of honorable judges to lead the struggle the scottish reformers john knox and john poynet upheld the same points of view and in the most important book of that movement george buchanan stated that if a government achieved power without taking into account the consent of the people or if a government rules their destiny in an unjust or arbitrary fashion then that government becomes a tyranny and can be divested of power or in a final recourse its leaders can be put to death john althus a german jurist of the early 17th century stated in his treatise on politics that sovereignty as the supreme authority of the state is born from the voluntary concourse of all its members that governmental authority stems from the people and that its unjust illegal or tyrannical function exempts them from the duty of obedience and justifies resistance or rebellion thus far honorable judges i have mentioned examples from antiquity from the middle ages and from the beginnings of our times i selected these examples from writers of all creeds what is more you can see that the right to rebellion is at the very root of cubas existence as a nation by virtue of it you are today able to appear in the robes of cuban judges would it be that those garments really served the cause of justice it is well known that in england during the 17th century two kings charles i and james ii were dethroned for despotism these actions coincided with the birth of liberal political philosophy and provided the ideological base for a new social class which was then struggling to break the bonds of feudalism against divine right autocracies this new philosophy upheld the principle of the social contract and of the consent of the governed and constituted the foundation of the english revolution of 1688 the american revolution of 1775 and the french revolution of 1789 these great revolutionary events ushered in the liberation of the spanish colonies in the new world the final link in that chain being broken by cuba the new philosophy nurtured our own political ideas and helped us to evolve our constitutions from the constitution of gu imaro up to the constitution of 1940 the latter was influenced by the socialist currents of our time the principle of the social function of property and of mans inalienable right to a decent living were built into it although large vested interests have prevented fully enforcing those rights the right of insurrection against tyranny then underwent its final consecration and became a fundamental tenet of political liberty as far back as 1649 john milton wrote that political power lies with the people who can enthrone and dethrone kings and have the duty of overthrowing tyrants john locke in his essay on government maintained that when the natural rights of man are violated the people have the right and the duty to alter or abolish the government the only remedy against unauthorized force is opposition to it by force jean jaques rousseau said with great eloquence in his social contract while a people sees itself forced to obey and obeys it does well but as soon as it can shake off the yoke and shakes it off it does better recovering its liberty through the use of the very right that has been taken away from it the strongest man is never strong enough to be master forever unless he converts force into right and obedience into duty force is a physical power i do not see what morality one may derive from its use to yield to force is an act of necessity not of will at the very least it is an act of prudence in what sense should this be called a duty to renounce freedom is to renounce ones status as a man to renounce ones human rights including ones duties there is no possible compensation for renouncing everything total renunciation is incompatible with the nature of man and to take away all free will is to take away all morality of conduct in short it is vain and contradictory to stipulate on the one hand an absolute authority and on the other an unlimited obedience thomas paine said that one just man deserves more respect than a rogue with a crown the peoples right to rebel has been opposed only by reactionaries like that clergyman of virginia jonathan boucher who said the right to rebel is a censurable doctrine derived from lucifer the father of rebellions the declaration of independence of the congress of philadelphia on july 4th 1776 consecrated this right in a beautiful paragraph which reads we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and to institute a new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness the famous french declaration of the rights of man willed this principle to the coming generations when the government violates the rights of the people insurrection is for them the most sacred of rights and the most imperative of duties when a person seizes sovereignty he should be condemned to death by free men i believe i have sufficiently justified my point of view i have called forth more reasons than the honorable prosecutor called forth to ask that i be condemned to 26 years in prison all these reasons support men who struggle for the freedom and happiness of the people none support those who oppress the people revile them and rob them heartlessly therefore i have been able to call forth many reasons and he could not adduce even one how can batistas presence in power be justified when he gained it against the will of the people and by violating the laws of the republic through the use of treachery and force how could anyone call legitimate a regime of blood oppression and ignominy how could anyone call revolutionary a regime which has gathered the most backward men methods and ideas of public life around it how can anyone consider legally valid the high treason of a court whose duty was to defend the constitution with what right do the courts send to prison citizens who have tried to redeem their country by giving their own blood their own lives all this is monstrous to the eyes of the nation and to the principles of true justice still there is one argument more powerful than all the others we are cubans and to be cuban implies a duty not to fulfill that duty is a crime is treason we are proud of the history of our country we learned it in school and have grown up hearing of freedom justice and human rights we were taught to venerate the glorious example of our heroes and martyrs c spedes agramonte maceo g mez and mart were the first names engraved in our minds we were taught that the titan once said that liberty is not begged for but won with the blade of a machete we were taught that for the guidance of cubas free citizens the apostle wrote in his book the golden age the man who abides by unjust laws and permits any man to trample and mistreat the country in which he was born is not an honorable man in the world there must be a certain degree of honor just as there must be a certain amount of light when there are many men without honor there are always others who bear in themselves the honor of many men these are the men who rebel with great force against those who steal the peoples freedom that is to say against those who steal honor itself in those men thousands more are contained an entire people is contained human dignity is contained we were taught that the 10th of october and the 24th of february are glorious anniversaries of national rejoicing because they mark days on which cubans rebelled against the yoke of infamous tyranny we were taught to cherish and defend the beloved flag of the lone star and to sing every afternoon the verses of our national anthem to live in chains is to live in disgrace and in opprobrium and to die for ones homeland is to live forever all this we learned and will never forget even though today in our land there is murder and prison for the men who practice the ideas taught to them since the cradle we were born in a free country that our parents bequeathed to us and the island will first sink into the sea before we consent to be the slaves of anyone
4871468 he had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop
4871469 even after we stopped having sex we would still kiss occasionally
4871470 what do i have to do to become as good as you and christine
4871471 wanting to be like christine is great wanting to be like me set your sights higher
4871472 you have a great personality and you must learn to be yourself when you are speaking
4871473 on this slide i am trying to show how network traffic can slow down the data acquisition phase of the load process
4871474 this slide shows that network traffic cause all these other things to slow down
4871475 the graph on this slide shows how much the application will slow down as network traffic increases
4871476 make your speech change the world how to move your audience to action
4871477 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4871478 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4871479 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4871480 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4871481 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4871482 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4871483 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4871484 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4871485 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4871486 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4871487 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4871488 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4871489 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4871490 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4871491 met sint juttemis als de kalveren op het ijs dansen
4871492 i prefer the schmuck off the street approach having been one myself
4871493 oh i will join toastmasters that will make me a public speaker
4871494 jeff sucks as a presenter we cant let him in
4871495 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4871496 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4871497 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4871498 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4871499 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4871500 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4871501 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4871502 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4871503 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4871504 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4871505 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4871506 you shall not have me today dragonforce i now control all of eastern detroit
4871507 oh dontcha know our neighbor carl is showin off quite a pair of antlers on the canadian pr0n channel eh
4871508 other this guy clearly needed the crap kicked out of him and here in this country it probably would have happened if russia used nukes they wouldnt go unscathed i hope russian are smart enough to realize that be thankful he was moderate compared to suicide bombers
4871509 no man has a natural right to commit aggression on the equal rights of another
4871510 i truly believe that the florida division of elections every decision that came from their office favored bush
4871511 hannah montana and miley cyrus best of both worlds concert
4871512 a lottery and you know that with lotteries you lose most of the time
4871513 theres nothing like taking a nice quiet bomb apart to steady the nerves
4871514 they were all our first choices everyone said yes which is so rare
4871515 our motto has been get the story right get the facts right tell it honestly
4871516 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
4871517 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
4871518 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
4871519 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
4871520 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
4871521 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
4871522 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
4871523 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
4871524 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
4871525 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
4871526 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
4871527 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
4871528 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
4871529 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
4871530 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
4871531 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4871532 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
4871533 a remarkable indictment of the corruption and cynicism rife among climate scientists
4871534 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
4871535 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
4871536 i told him if he allowed turbines in that field he would lose a son
4871537 i tell people its not a wind farm its an industrial development
4871538 we knew we were going to change the landscape maybe forever
4871539 we knew some people would be unhappy but the benefits far outweighed the objections of a few
4871540 im an educator not a wind expert or an investor
4871541 the great unknown which is how much the wind company is making
4871542 this cow doesnt need to be fed doesnt need a vet doesnt need a place to lie down
4871543 this project was happening like it or not and you would have to be a fool not to participate to be excited and take advantage of it
4871544 it seemed like the cost in terms of how it changed the community was too high
4871545 its hard when change is for the common good but some people suffer more than others
4871546 dad taught us such respect for the land for my father to be part of this
4871547 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4871548 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4871549 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4871550 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4871551 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4871552 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
4871553 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
4871554 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
4871555 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
4871556 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
4871557 these solutions are flexible the student will be moving a few times throughout college and you want something that can be adjusted to different places
4871558 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted me to meet at midnight sunday night id be there
4871559 its the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind and its happening very very fast
4871560 the u s with texas in the lead added more in wind power than the world added in coal power last year
4871561 it is clear that he and i have two very different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4871562 liberals are more self centered than conservatives conservatives are more generous and charitable than liberals liberals are more envious and less hardworking than conservatives conservatives value truth more than liberals and are less prone to cheating and lying liberals are more angry than conservatives conservatives are actually more knowledgeable than liberals liberals are more dissatisfied and unhappy than conservatives

4871566 i want you to know i was wearing my rhode island democrats t shirt when i was exercising this morning put that in the paper
4871567 i get amused when i see that stern faced young man from colorado extolling the merits of assault weapons

4871570 i dont care if you have jesus christ in the van
4871571 no i know if i needed to get out id make my way out just as i made my way in you have to see the possibilities
4871572 if my opponent had been there at the moon launch it would have been called a risky rocket scheme
4871573 if hed been there when edison was testing the light bulb it would have been a risky anti candle scheme
4871574 and if hed been there when the internet was invented
4871575 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
4871576 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4871577 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4871578 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4871579 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
4871580 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4871581 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4871582 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4871583 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4871584 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4871585 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4871586 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4871587 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4871588 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4871589 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4871590 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4871591 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4871592 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4871593 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4871594 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4871595 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4871596 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4871597 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4871598 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4871599 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4871600 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4871601 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4871602 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4871603 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4871604 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4871605 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4871606 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4871607 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4871608 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet
4871609 recycling is recycling glass should be included its not about making money its about making difference
4871610 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4871611 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4871612 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4871613 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4871614 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4871615 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
4871616 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
4871617 i told him if he allowed turbines in that field he would lose a son
4871618 we knew we were going to change the landscape maybe forever
4871619 we knew some people would be unhappy but the benefits far outweighed the objections of a few
4871620 im an educator not a wind expert or an investor
4871621 the great unknown which is how much the wind company is making
4871622 this cow doesnt need to be fed doesnt need a vet doesnt need a place to lie down
4871623 this project was happening like it or not and you would have to be a fool not to participate to be excited and take advantage of it
4871624 it seemed like the cost in terms of how it changed the community was too high
4871625 its hard when change is for the common good but some people suffer more than others
4871626 dad taught us such respect for the land for my father to be part of this
4871627 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4871628 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4871629 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4871630 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4871631 ive lent my crystal ball to someone so i cant give you the figure
4871632 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4871633 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4871634 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4871635 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4871636 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4871637 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4871638 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4871639 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4871640 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4871641 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4871642 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4871643 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4871644 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4871645 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4871646 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4871647 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4871648 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4871649 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4871650 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4871651 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4871652 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4871653 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4871654 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4871655 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4871656 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4871657 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4871658 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4871659 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4871660 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4871661 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4871662 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4871663 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4871664 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4871665 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
4871666 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4871667 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4871668 the band was formed in the city of dalian a busy seaport in northeast china in the year of 1999 wangwen was at first started by two awkward at that time guitarists who were crazy about the smashing pumpkins and later joined by the drummer who also brought along the band name representing the idea of an unknown band and insensibility to what others say the band began to record their first demo the animal world on their own in the same year they formed since then the band members had been changing while continuous creation of new pieces of music and performing lingshuihe the icewaterriver was recorded on their own in 2000 and the third demo the tenebrous yinyang road was also completed two years later during this period the music style of the band had been gradually changing from vocal to instrumental and started to draw broad attentions both from the reviews and the audience as well it was considered as the one of the leading band from china in the fields of post rock and acid rock the band was influenced by mogwai red red meat mono explosion in the sky polvo tortois gybe etc
4871669 this event shows the pipes work and that if you put on great programming that people want to watch then theyll show up
4871670 everyone of us who has visited here comes away with a deep admiration for the chinese people so much to admire here and so much to learn
4871671 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4871672 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4871673 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4871674 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4871675 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4871676 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4871677 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4871678 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4871679 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4871680 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4871681 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4871682 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4871683 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4871684 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4871685 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4871686 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4871687 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4871688 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4871689 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4871690 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4871691 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4871692 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4871693 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4871694 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4871695 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4871696 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4871697 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4871698 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4871699 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4871700 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4871701 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4871702 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4871703 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4871704 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4871705 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4871706 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4871707 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4871708 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4871709 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4871710 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4871711 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4871712 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4871713 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4871714 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4871715 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4871716 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4871717 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4871718 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4871719 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4871720 just so you all know we did set a record
4871721 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4871722 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4871723 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4871724 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4871725 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4871726 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4871727 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4871728 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4871729 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4871730 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4871731 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4871732 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4871733 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4871734 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4871735 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4871736 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4871737 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4871738 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4871739 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4871740 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4871741 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4871742 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4871743 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4871744 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4871745 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4871746 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4871747 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4871748 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4871749 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4871750 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4871751 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4871752 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4871753 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4871754 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4871755 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4871756 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4871757 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4871758 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4871759 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4871760 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4871761 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4871762 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4871763 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4871764 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4871765 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4871766 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4871767 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4871768 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4871769 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4871770 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4871771 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4871772 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4871773 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4871774 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4871775 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4871776 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4871777 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4871778 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4871779 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4871780 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
4871781 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4871782 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4871783 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4871784 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4871785 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4871786 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
4871787 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
4871788 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4871789 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year

4871853 charter change threatens seriously the remaining nationalist provisions of the constitution especially with respect to national patrimony

4871860 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4871861 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4871862 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4871863 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4871864 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4871865 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4871866 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4871867 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4871868 semuanya itu jelas bagi yang cerdas lurus bagi yang berpengetahuan
4871869 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

4871872 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4871873 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4871874 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4871875 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4871876 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4871877 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4871878 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4871879 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4871880 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4871881 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4871882 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4871883 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4871884 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4871885 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4871886 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4871887 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4871888 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4871889 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4871890 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4871891 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

4871893 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4871894 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4871895 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4871896 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4871897 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4871898 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4871899 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4871900 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4871901 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4871902 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4871903 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

4871906 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4871907 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4871908 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4871909 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4871910 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4871911 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4871912 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4871913 who are open to doing something on the production side
4871914 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4871915 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4871916 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4871917 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4871918 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4871919 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4871920 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4871921 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4871922 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4871923 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4871924 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

4871930 we got really really fortunate that tony stewart had his trouble on pit road
4871931 they dont slip up very often and he was really fast i was really happy that he wasnt right on my rear bumper or i didnt have to pass him for the last run
4871932 hopefully it was a peanut wrapper but i dont know what it was
4871933 it made me real nervous tony was doing everything he could to stay in front of me
4871934 i just needed to be right on his rear bumper but luckily kenny wallace let me run all over his back bumper and get that debris off
4871935 we had a great car on the long runs and had a decent one at the start
4871936 the problem at the start with new tyres you just about had to run the bottom and running there the 60 edwards seemed like he had a little bit more motor obviously with the new restrictor plate on that nascar gave us in
4871937 it definitely hurt us in the short run on old tyres where handling was more important we could move up to the top let the engine keep it wound up i felt like we had something for them but just ran out of time and carl got to far away on the last run
4871938 we had pretty sane day we stayed in the top three there and carl and brian got away from the field and pretty much gave me the indication that was going to the match there at the end
4871939 i got us a little to tight there in the center at the end and lost a little bit of track position i just couldnt get the car to turn like we had it earlier in the day its my fault
4871940 the car was definitely a top 10 car right up until we put that last set of tires on and it just got tight for some reason that was disappointing because it was a good car today it was better on the short runs than the long runs well take it and go on to bristol next week id like a top 10 today though

4871943 in europe we have much to gain from a further opening of global trade we are highly competitive knowledge based and innovative we are the largest economy in the world we are the biggest exporters our economies and our living standards which depend on economic success need open world markets
4871944 72 of the bahamas foreign currency earnings come from services and 85 of this is from tourism and offshore banking fees that do not need an epa 83 of exports of goods go to the us and canada and only 13 to the eu so merchandise exports to the eu provides just 4 of the bahamas total export earnings there are probably other people who will buy bahamas crawfish if the eu wants to charge an 8 tariff on the other hand bahamas will be giving up tariff revenues on eu imports an additional 49 to be zero rated within 15 years and 5 in years 15 25 on top of the 32 already duty free

4872030 although gordon brown has been conspicuous by his low profile at least he has avoided making a dash to tblisi as david cameron has done to show disingenuous solidarity with the georgian people and to repeat apparently on behalf of the british government the promise of nato membership instead of looking statesmanlike which may have been the intention he looks concerned but unworldly and immature
4872031 he tried to conceal a body in an official investigation
4872032 we dont have enough evidence to support an arrest at this time
4872033 we certainly recovered a lot of evidence both in the home and in the car the suspect was driving
4872034 im really hoping some information comes out that gives us some direction
4872035 i thought it was a pretty straightforward case but its not
4872036 domestic harmony act where both genders are accountable for the violence at home
4872037 an equal gender law would be ideal but there is simply too much physical evidence to prove that it is mainly the woman who suffers at the hands of the man
4872038 if you developed half a brain with some sense and perspective for justice that would be ideal

4872053 intels processor shipments alone grew nearly 4 3 per cent over the first quarter and 20 8 per cent year over year while amds processor shipments were about flat

4872064 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4872065 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4872066 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4872067 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4872068 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4872082 when was the last time you found a bear skeleton in the woods
4872083 when you slice into a snedleys product its like slicing into a fresh grown pork chop
4872084 the fruit is out of this world and the vegetables literally fry themselves just add heat
4872085 grandma and grandpa didnt eat tofu they ate bacon real bacon dripping with the fat of this land and weve forsaken that heritage for the sake of a few calories
4872086 our entire family is sad and grieving as if we have lost a family member the queso and cheese enchiladas were the best anywhere hands down it was my birthday spot for the last 20 years so very sad
4872087 i still have one quart remaining in my freezer and i will be extremely cautious with whom i share it only a true lover of tex mex would deserve this honor
4872088 about time maybe a real restaurant will go up in that spot soon they have been serving nothing but swill for the past five years
4872089 we heard a prominent doctor denounce the tamale stands on the squares as sources of disease its about time the cooking and eating was done somewhere else than in the streets and squares
4872090 there are about a dozen of the stands and hundreds of people eat at them night and day besides tamales chili is served among other cheap dishes many farmers coming to the city eat there it is maintained by some citizens that forcing the stands out of business is a poor move and will be a hardship to many people who eat there
4872091 the two story frame building on texas avenue near the corner of main used as a tamale and chile con carne restaurant has been torn down a new building will take its place
4872092 there isnt a goddamned fajita within ten miles of it
4872093 the first time i ate mexican food was at the mexican inn in downtown fort worth when i was in junior high
4872094 cheese enchiladas rice and beans ill never forget it it was like an orgasm
4872095 fuck healthy ive been eating lard for over 60 years
4872096 what happened to tex mex is the same thing that happened to all the other food it got too fancy culinary institutes are turning out idiots who want to put ferns and cactus on everything unfortunately its infected tex mex too
4872097 when i 35 was completed moises started closing the restaurants
4872098 it was just like what happened to those wonderful diners along route 66
4872099 you need to get in there theres not much time
4872100 as the ecological patterns of this large geographic area varied enormously each native group adjusted its lifestyle to benefit from the available resources such patterns reflected not so much economic prudence as a spiritual relationship with nature regardless of regional variations the native peoples viewed the world as a balanced system in which all creation animate and inanimate existed harmoniously thus the biological world of edible plants or fish or game remained intimately attached to a spirit world humanity was but one part of that system the acquisition of food clothing or shelter therefore depended upon maintaining spiritual relations with the rest of creation from this perspective the idea of owning parcels of land bits of creation was unthinkable
4872101 the simplest and lowest form of the council was that of the gens
4872102 all the members of an iroquois gens were personally free and they were bound to defend each others freedom they were equal in privileges and in personal rights the sachem and chiefs claiming no superiority and they were a brotherhood bound together by ties of kin liberty equality and fraternity though never formulated were cardinal principles of the gens
4872103 a powerful popular element pervaded the whole organization and influenced its action it is seen in the right of the gentes to elect and depose their sachems and chiefs in the right of the people to be heard in council through orators of their own selection and in the voluntary system in the military service in this and the next succeeding ethnical period democratic principles were the vital element of gentile society
4872104 in the world of ideas to name something is to own it
4872105 sometime after 9 11 an unprovoked mass murder perpetrated by 19 men 15 of whom were saudis green went geostrategic as americans started to realize we were financing both sides in the war on terrorism we were financing the u s military with our tax dollars and we were financing a transformation of islam in favor of its most intolerant strand with our gasoline purchases how stupid is that
4872106 no wonder more americans have concluded that conserving oil to put less money in the hands of hostile forces is now a geostrategic imperative
4872107 we are funding the rope for the hanging of ourselves
4872108 people change when they have to not when we tell them to and falling oil prices make them have to that is why if we are looking for a plan b for iraq a way of pressing for political reform in the middle east without going to war again there is no better tool than bringing down the price of oil when it comes to fostering democracy among petroauthoritarians it doesnt matter whether youre a neocon or a radical lib if youre not also a geo green you wont succeed
4872109 all of our scientific work says the most damaging monsters start to come out from behind that door when you hit the doubling of co2 levels
4872110 were running an uncontrolled experiment on the only home we have
4872111 to convey the scale involved socolow and pacala have created a pie chart with 15 different wedges
4872112 replace 1 400 large coal fired plants with gas fired plants increase the fuel economy of two billion cars from 30 to 60 miles per gallon add twice todays nuclear output to displace coal drive two billion cars on ethanol using one sixth of the worlds cropland increase solar power 700 fold to displace coal cut electricity use in homes offices and stores by 25 percent install carbon capture and sequestration capacity at 800 large coal fired plants
4872113 according to lester brown the founder of the earth policy institute if china keeps growing at 8 percent a year by 2031 the per capita income of 1 45 billion chinese will be the same as americas in 2004 china currently has only one car for every 100 people but brown projects that as it reaches american income levels if it copies american consumption it will have three cars for every four people or 1 1 billion vehicles the total world fleet today is 800 million vehicles
4872114 the only way to stimulate the scale of sustained investment in research and development of non co2 emitting power at the china price is if the developed countries who can afford to do so force their people to pay the full climate economic and geopolitical costs of using gasoline and dirty coal those countries that have signed the kyoto protocol are starting to do that but america is not
4872115 president bush claims hes protecting american companies by not imposing tough mileage conservation or clean power standards but hes actually helping them lose the race for the next great global industry japan has some of the worlds highest gasoline taxes and stringent energy efficiency standards for vehicles and it has the worlds most profitable and innovative car company toyota thats no accident
4872116 being serious starts with reframing the whole issue helping americans understand as the carnegie fellow david rothkopf puts it
4872117 im sorry ny times and mr friedman for lifting so much of your stuff but its got to get out there i hope youll understand
4872118 the how to manual that anyone can write or edit
4872119 clearing the pr pollution that clouds the science on climate change
4872120 the story of stuff exposes the connections between a huge number of environmental and social issues and calls us together to create a more sustainable and just world itll teach you something itll make you laugh and it just may change the way you look at all the stuff in your life forever
4872121 this week began with a landmark decision by the us supreme court and ended with the release of the ipccs 4th assessment on climate change impacts following the supreme courts decision its clear that epa has the authority and should regulate co2 and the ipcc report delivered the strongest statement to date on the consequences of climate change taken together with increasing calls from ceos states and the public the message is loud and clear read our lips we need mandatory climate policy in the united states
4872122 under either emissions scenario the northeast of the future will be a tangibly different place
4872123 calls our attention to the future of the world that our children will inherit and if we dont take action now we could face severe consequences
4872124 captures and recycles up to at least 87 percent of the heat that would otherwise be lost
4872125 a model of sustainability for academic centers across the u s
4872126 encourage christians in each hamlet village town and city to commit themselves to pray regularly and faithfully for their neighbours and local community
4872127 the prayer should be focused on our immediate neighbours and the local community
4872128 obviously as concern builds in consequence of praying for people our awareness of their needs will start to express itself in practical and caring ways
4872129 coexistence with mankind has given rise to the sort of tough plants that flourish despite the worst we can do
4872130 greg smith didnt really have great command of the strike zone but to his credit he only gave up a couple of runs and kept us in the game
4872131 our problem is not in runs allowed but in scoring runs we didnt get anything going we had the bases loaded with no outs and again with one out and we didnt score those are big situations and they are magnified when your not scoring every run becomes crucial our pitching staff gives us a chance if we get one or two more runs wed get a few more wins
4872132 i like the guy a lot b j is a wonderful young man whos going to be a superstar in this league hes a big part of our organization now and in the future but you have to draw the line at some point he listened to me i listened to him and well move along were just looking for a continuous effort
4872133 an independent review of the latest united nations report on climate change shows that the scientific evidence about global warming remains uncertain and provides no basis for alarmism
4872134 warming of the climate system is unequivocal as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global mean sea level
4872135 the average temperature of the global ocean has incresed to depths of at least 3000m
4872136 at continental regional and ocean based scales numerous long term changes in climate have been observed
4872137 the last time the polar regions were significantly warmer than present for an extended period about 125 000 years ago reductions in polar ice volume led to 4 to 6 meters of sea level rise
4872138 anthropogenic warming and sea level rise would continue for centuries due to the timescales associated with climate processes and feedbacks even if greenhouse gas concentrations were to be stabilized
4872139 for articles that emphasize the shortcomings of a report from the u n s intergovernmental panel on climate change
4872140 offsets place disproportionate emphasis on individual lifestyles and carbon footprints distracting attention from the wider systemic changes and collective political action that needs to be taken to tackle climate change
4872141 some types of carbon offset initiatives may actually slow the changes aimed at coping with global warming by prolonging consumers dependence on oil coal and gas and encouraging them to take more short haul flights and drive bigger cars than they would otherwise have done
4872142 some carbon offset firms have begun to acknowledge that certain investments like tree planting may be ineffective and they are shifting their focus to what they say is reliable activity like wind turbines cleaner burning stoves or buying up credits that otherwise would allow companies to pollute
4872143 many environmentalists and indigenous communities around the world fear that use of sinks will have a negligible impact on reducing global warming while having an enormous impact on people worldwide as poor countries desperate to earn money to pay back debts look to selling their lands and forests for the carbon markets
4872144 hi feel free to walk around and explore coffees over there or would you like a quick tour first
4872145 pounds of carbon not dropping out of my tailpipe but rising up into the atmosphere
4872146 has never been inevitable but a matter of values and political choice a pricepoint issue
4872147 network of natural human and built systems that define the world as it is today
4872148 if we slowly change our greenhouse gas emissions over the coming century the u n actually estimates that we will live in a warmer but immensely richer world
4872149 he considers antarctica the canary in the mine but again doesnt tell the full story he presents pictures from the 2 of antarctica that is dramatically warming and ignores the 98 that has largely cooled over the past 35 years
4872150 a rise in the global mean temperature does not imply universal warming
4872151 it would have been great to ask him why he only talks about a sea level rise of 20 feet in his movie he shows scary sequences of 20 feet flooding florida san francisco new york holland calcutta beijing and shanghai but were realistic levels not dramatic enough the u n climate panel expects only a foot of sea level rise over this century
4872152 buying offsets for an energy wasteful home or business and calling it environmentally responsible is akin to buying a diet coke to go with your double bacon cheeseburger and calling it a weight loss program efficiency and calorie reduction comes first
4872153 carbon offsets are just like paying for your right to pollute
4872154 i have spent almost 14 years thinking about sustainable development i am convinced that the only way that we will begin to live more sustainably is to create a system of living that is attractive when compared with the existing consumption oriented system
4872155 carbon offsets are the modern day indulgences sold to an increasingly carbon conscious public to absolve their climate sins
4872156 we get journalists up here year round they come in migrations just like the snowbirds and the other animals and they want to see eskimos falling through holes in the ice or houses falling off of bluffs well roll with whatevers going on our cultures built on change were strong durable people and we just keep adjusting
4872157 show how problems can be addressed through simple incremental changes in behavior
4872158 who is better equiped than artists thinking outside the box employing their creativity and resourcefulness and a love of beauty to envision a more sustainable world
4872159 ecoartists can be thought of as midwives for the earth facilitators of environmental education consultants for environmental restoration and visionaries for transforming ecological communities
4872160 everyone i know wanted tickets we chinese love to see sports
4872161 its a pity there are so many empty seats we would like to know who is responsible
4872162 this is our fourth olympics but getting tickets to this one really has been a nightmare
4872163 then you get inside and you wonder who got all the tickets because there is nobody there
4872164 all the tickets have been sold out we will be encouraging all the ticket holders to watch the matches themselves
4872165 if they dont want to go they should give the tickets to those who do
4872166 it now takes about one year and three months for the earth to regenerate what we use in a single year
4872167 electronic reference about the earth its natural environments and their interaction with society
4872168 a clothesline in a neighborhood can lower property values by 15 percent
4872169 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economics costs of not acting
4872170 before brad and i dated i was a secretary at the biology department at harvard and he was directing the science museum at the time well i thought brad was just a crazy mountain climber i wasnt impressed
4872171 he took me up in an open plane with the flying suit and goggles and leather helmet we would go into a dive and i had a good time i felt like i was anne lindbergh
4872172 the feeling that getting up high was such a unique experience up there you get a feeling of the insignificance of yourself it wasnt about any sense of achievement really
4872173 i think i had a funny kind of religious experience on top of mt mckinley the beauty there is overwhelming like looking out over a vast 3 dimensional map i walked over to the edge and i had a vision from my old sunday school book i know it was clouds but i saw god up there with a white beard and all i could think to say was help me get home to see my kids again
4872174 the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way
4872175 we want to be able to play against all the best teams in our league
4872176 being lied to is one of the biggest betrayals that people have trouble forgiving especially at the start of a relationship most people arent good at practicing forgiveness and compassion which are required in starting with a clean slate again
4872177 if youve ever had sex you know this is a myth
4872178 no ones body is perfect sex isnt seamless it can involve starting and stopping condoms are often left out but are necessary to use to reduce the risk of stds women dont stay consistently wet men often dont maintain a rock hard erection from start to finish positions may change as a couple finds what works for them the list goes on
4872179 the odds are against any couple that this can actually work out to a happy and healthy relationship and family life
4872180 people love the idea of an instant connection and sexual compatibility
4872181 situations like those captured in titanic are few and far between yet people thrive off of them because they are the seeming pinnacle of love primarily for the ease involved in titanic long term consequences arent an issue
4872182 when someone tries to reinvent themselves in a way thats not rooted in their true self in an effort to make a relationship work it only goes so far
4872183 the secret to a healthy and lasting relationship that few films reveal be yourself
4872184 sitting around waiting doesnt generally work because you arent out there meeting people
4872185 the more people we meet the better the chances we can meet a good love match
4872186 when sex is the foundation whether its sex buddies friends with benefits a one night stand or having sex on the first night of meeting someone hoping it will turn into something more is a surefire mistake
4872187 the main reason why this relationship ended up working was that expectations were set up from the beginning
4872188 there are a bunch of mr rights for people as some individuals are going to be more attractive in the package they have to offer than others this outlook becomes unhealthy if you limit it to the idea of there only being one and have perfectionist standards as thats unrealistic
4872189 i figure if im ever gonna do this this is the day to do this
4872190 in april 2006 hundreds of thousands of immigrant rights protestors marched in cities across the united states
4872191 dangerous to the peace and safety of the united states

4872381 ikkje som menneskeord men som det guds ord det i sanning er
4872382 difor den som avviser dette avviser ikkje eit menneske men gud han som gjev dykk sin heilage ande
4872383 dei teikn som er kjennemerke p ein apostel vart gjort hj dykk med stort tolmod b de ved teikn og under og mektige gjerningar
4872384 ta kristus bort fr skriftene kva meir vil du s finne i dei
4872385 de granskar skriftene fordi de meiner at de har evig liv i dei og desse er det som vitnar om meg
4872386 men desse teikna er skrivne for at de skal tru at jesus er messias guds son og for at de ved trua skal ha liv i hans namn
4872387 for eg ville ikkje vita av noko hj dykk utan jesus kristus og han krossfest
4872388 i han ligg alle skattane av visdom og kunnskap l ynde
4872389 dette er nemlig to av de viktigste gjerninger av gud i mennesket forskrekke og rettferdiggj re og levendegj re de forskrekkede hele skriften fordeler seg p disse to gjerninger den ene del er loven som viser anklager og ford mmer synden den andre del er evangeliet dvs det l fte om n den som blir gitt i kristus og dette l fte blir stadig gjentatt gjennom hele skriften
4872390 lova l rer oss kva vi skal gjere og d mer oss skuldige i ulydnad
4872391 all forkynning av synd og guds vreide er ei forkynning av lova uansett korleis og n r det vert gjort
4872392 men vi veit at alt det lova seier det talar ho til dei som er under lova s kvar munn skal verta attlaten og heile verda verta skuldig for gud difor vert inkje kj t rettferdiggjort for han ved lovgjerningar for ved lova kjem ein til kjenna synda
4872393 hele denne l re om rettferdiggj relsen m f res tilbake til den nevnte kamp i den forskrekkede samvittighet og den kan ikke forst s uten denne kamp
4872394 den som held heile lova men sn var i eitt bod han har vorte skuldig i dei alle
4872395 alle har synda og st r utan re for gud
4872396 jeg tror at jesus kristus som er sann gud f dt av faderen fra evighet og tillike sant menneske f dt av jomfru maria er min herre som har gjenl st meg fortapte og ford mte menneske kj pt meg og fridd meg fra alle synder fra d dens og djevelens makt ikke med gull eller s lv med med sitt hellige dyre blod og sin skyldfrie lidelse og d d
4872397 den tro som rettferdiggj r er imidlertid ikke bare en historisk kunnskap men tilslutning til guds l fte der syndenes forlatelse og rettferdiggj relsen blir tilbudt uten vederlag for kristi skyld
4872398 kristushendelsene utfordrer til etterpr ving av hva som urettmessig binder og begrenser mennesker og hva som frigj r til liv i kj rlighet

4872410 hvor n r avvisningen av homoseksualitet i bibelen er forbundet med dommen over hedenskapet
4872411 ny viten har klarlagt et fenomen som ligger utenfor bibelens horisont nemlig det som gjerne kalles ekte homofili
4872412 fastholde den tradisjonelle entydige ford mmelse eller gi homofile forhold kirkelig godkjennelse og velsignelse
4872413 er blitt l srevet fra en konkret sammenheng og er blitt ford mmende stereotypier de har ikke noen egentlig moralsk argumentasjon
4872414 de kan ikke tjene som eksempler p forsvarlig kristen refleksjon over moralske sp rsm l
4872415 b de lese bibelen oppmerksomt og ydmykt for forst hva den sa og hva den sier og vi m klargj re hva vi mener n r vi snakker om homoseksualitet i dag
4872416 betyr ikke at dette var den eneste form for homoseksualitet som var kjent i antikken
4872417 god grunn til tro at en i den antikke kulturen var i stand til skjelne mellom det vi ville kalle konstitusjonelt homofile og mennesker som selv valgte en homoseksuell adferd ut fra en bifil eller heterofil legning
4872418 understreker det allmenngyldige i bildet av den homoseksuelle adferd som frafall fra guds skapervilje
4872419 homoseksuell adferd h rer til blant de mange synder som p kaller guds vrede og som f rer til d dsdom p dommens dag
4872420 homoseksuell adferd er i strid med det sjette bud som er en del av de ti bud og som har full gyldighet b de i den gamle og den nye pakt
4872421 en etisk refleksjon om mulighetene for anvende de bibelske normer for seksualitet i v r tid
4872422 ut fra mer allmennetiske perspektiver om utviklingen av kj nnsidentitet i et mer langsiktig kulturelt perspektiv
4872423 men verken krisushendingen eller rettferdiggj relsen av tro kan opph yes til et abstrakt prinsipp bispem tet mener s ledes at de konkrete skriftord som advarer mot homofile handlinger snarere blir styrket enn svekket n r de leses i lys av overordnede hermeneutiske prinsipper som skapelsesteologi bibelsk antropologi rettferdiggj relsesl ren og dialektikken mellom lov og evangelium
4872424 se at en subjektiv moralsk overbevisning kan sette ut av kraft den objektive etiske bed mmelse av en handling som er begrunnet i skriften
4872425 det fullstendige etiske resonnement m til sist pr ves mot skriftens kjerne og stjerne luther den korsfestede og oppstandne jesus kristus
4872426 opphevelsen av slaveriet avskaffelsen av d dsstraff rettmessige sosiale krav og kvinners likeverd sic
4872427 et slikt brudd forutsetter at mennesket har et reelt valg
4872428 ikke engang i teorien ha et alternativ til seksuell avholdenhet vil bety at det ikke er noe legitimt rom for dr mmer om og lengsler etter et seksuelt samliv dermed blir det umulig si ja til sin seksuelle identitet dette inneb rer at det ogs blir umulig oppleve seg som et helt menneske
4872429 sp rsm let om homofilt samliv er synd kan ikke besvares det m bli en sak mellom den homofiles samvittighet og gud
4872430 debatten og uenigheten har ikke svekket den respekt vi har for hverandre vi vil fortsatt st i det tjenestefellesskap vi deler som biskoper i den samme kirke det er v rt klare nske at denne saken ikke f r splitte kirken uenighet og debatt m ikke skygge for det som er kirkens hovedsak og som binder oss sammen budskapet om den korsfestede og oppstandne jesus kristus
4872431 kirkem tet forutsetter at kirkelige tilsettingsorganer og biskopene i sin embetsut velse innretter sin praksis i tr d med dette
4872432 vi har vist at etiske sp rsm l kan v re l resp rsm l endog det vi kaller bekjennelsessp rsm l der avvikende l re og praksis kan true kirkens enhet
4872433 for eksempel en argumentasjon der en sier seg fri fra forpliktelsen p skrift og bekjennelse eller som nekter se sp rsm let i sammenheng med bibelsk skapelsesteologi og som ikke lenger ser ekteskapet som den grunnleggende samlivsform
4872434 sidestille heterofilt ekteskap med homofilt samliv er i strid med grunnleggende etiske prinsipper og m anses som kirkesplittende vrangl re
4872435 gjeldende norm i kirken med derav f lgende konsekvenser for embetsut velsen knyttet til ordinasjon vigsling tilsetting eller liturgiske ordninger
4872436 uten bagatellisere uenigheten om forst elsen av skriften og vurderingen av ordnet homofilt samliv er det etter l renemndas oppfatning l remessig mulig samles om ord og sakrament p tross av den uenighet som r der i homofilisp rsm let mellom biskop osberg og prost dingstad
4872437 kommer an p hvordan en embetsb rer i kirken utformer og begrunner sitt syn og praksis
4872438 homofilisp rsm let til et sp rsm l om frelse og fortapelse
4872439 homofilisp rsm let ikke kan sies ha funnet sin avklaring med det arbeid som hittil har skjedd i kirken med denne saken
4872440 det er naudsynt seie noko meir om kva som kan og kva som ikkje kan aksepterast av grunngjevingar og standpunkt i kyrkja
4872441 skriftforst else og skriftbruk med s rlig henblikk p homofilisaken
4872442 de tre tekstene i det nye testamente som direkte omtaler homoseksuelle handlinger finnes alle i den paulinske brevsamling og er i sin ordlyd klart avvisende tekstene representerer en forst elsesramme der differensieringen mellom mann og kvinne slik den er gitt i skapelsen innebar at homoseksuelle handlinger og begj r var forst som brudd med guds skapervilje
4872443 det m v re mulig ha et restriktivt syn p homofilt samliv uten bli anklaget for krenke homofiles menneskeverd
4872444 kristus hendelsene i evangelia utfordrer til etterpr ving av hva som urettmessig binder og begrenser mennesker og hva som frigj r til liv i kj rlighet
4872445 vanskelig avvise at homoseksualitet ogs kan tolkes som en variasjon innenfor arten menneske
4872446 alt tyder p at paulus har hatt kjennskap til variasjonen og utbredelsen av homofili og bifili i sin samtid
4872447 fastholder ekteskapet mellom mann og kvinne som den eksklusive ramme om det seksuelle samliv
4872448 vi kan ikke se at to uforenlige syn kan v re retningsgivende for l re ordninger og liturgi
4872449 alle i nemnda nsker framheve skriftens autoritet og status som troverdig og forpliktende vitnesbyrd om guds penbaring og som verste norm for kirkens l re og forkynnelse
4872450 samme grad av enighet om premissene for vedtakene om samlevende homofiles vigslede tjeneste i kirken
4872451 det reformatoriske prinsipp om skriften som verste norm for kirkens l re
4872452 at det fortsatt ogs er kirkelig begrunnelse for ikke ordinere vigsle ansette eller gi tjenestebrev til homofilt samlevende dersom biskop eller ansettelsesorgan vurderer at dette ikke er i tr d med kirkens l re og form l

4872455 eg er herren din gud som f rde deg ut or egypt or tr lehuset
4872456 ut av dei ti boda str ymer og avhenger alle dei andre boda og heile moses
4872457 ta kristus bort fr skriftene kva meir vil du s finne der
4872458 kristus interpreteres i dictata som exemplar og urbillede for os og vort liv i verden
4872459 thi i det alternativ befinder vi os ifl luther i al vor skrifteksegese enten forst r vi skriften ud fra kristus og den i ham forkyndte trosretf rdighed der oph ver al gerningsretferdighed for gud eller ogs forvansker vi skriften i det vi tolker den i lyset af v r egen filosofi og denne filosofis inderste v sen vil v re gennomsyret av gerningsretf rdighed
4872460 the direct application of the old testament texts to jesus christ his words and deeds his death and resurrection his church and his work in the believer was by far the strongest and most comprehensive theme in luthers interpretation of the old testament
4872461 med nokre f korte ord profeterer og forkynner salmisten om guds storgjerningar og under nemleg evangeliet og kristi kongerike som var f resagd men enno ikkje openberra p den tida
4872462 any research which thinks historically will have to give up without hesitation or reservation luthers scheme of christological predictions in the old testament
4872463 kor lite de skj nar og kor seine de er til tru alt det profetane har sagt s tok han til leggja ut for dei det som st r om han i alle skriftene heilt fr moses og hos alle profetane
4872464 e granskar skriftene for de meiner at de har evig liv i dei men det er dei som vitnar om meg
4872465 alle profetane vitnar om han og seier at kvar den som trur p han skal f tilgjeving for syndene ved hans namn
4872466 denne frelsa var det profetane s kte etter og ville utforska d dei profeterte om den n den de skulle f dei freista finna ut kva tid kristi ande som var i dei viste fram til og korleis den tida skulle vera for anden vitna om kristi lidingar og den herlegdomen som sidan skulle koma

4872470 i write entirely to find out what im thinking what im looking at what i see and what it means what i want and what i fear
4872471 to live with the bible is more like living with a multi generational extended family than with a crotchety grandfather who keeps telling us of the good old days
4872472 om dere huser tvil om det vi har penbart for v r tjener s bring et kapittel like godt og kall fram de vitner dere har som ikke er gud om dere snakker sant
4872473 adam levde saman med eva kona si og ho vart med barn og f dde kain d sa ho eg har f tt ein gut av herren sidan fekk ho abel bror hans abel vart sauegj tar kain vart jordbrukar d det leid av ei tid hende det at kain bar fram for herren eit offer av gr da p marka abel bar fram offer han g han gav av dei fyrstef dde lamma i saueflokken sin og feittet deira herren s g med velvilje p abel og hans offerg ve men ansa ikkje kain og g va hans d vart kain brennande harm og stirte nedfor seg sidan sa kain til abel bror sin kom lat oss g ut p marka og medan dei var der ute rauk kain p abel bror sin og slo han ihel
4872474 fremles for dem sannferdig beretningen om adams to s nner da de bragte offer og det ble mottatt fra den ene men ikke fra den andre denne sa jeg skal sandelig sl deg ihjel og den andre svarte gud tar bare imot fra de gudfryktige men han ble drevet til drepe sin bror s han drepte ham og ble en av taperne derp sendte gud en ravn som sparket i jorden for vise ham hvordan han skulle skjule ondskapen sin brors lik han sa v meg greier jeg ikke v re som denne ravn s jeg kan skjule ondskapen min brors lik og han angret
4872475 d barnet jesus var fem r leika han ved ein dam og han hadde litt fin leire og ut fr den forma han tolv spurvar
4872476 the story of cain and abel in the quran and the muslim commentators some observations
4872477 the evidences that do exist for the history of the quran text on the contrary ruin the claim for the qurans textual perfection and relegate such a claim to the realms of popular sentiment and wishful thinking instead of a case for divine preservation we find a very mundane and predictable course
4872478 the quran follows on from the two revelations that preceded it and is not only free from contradictions in its narrations the sign of the various human manipulations to be found in the gospels but provides a quality all of its own for those who examine it objectively and in the light of science i e its complete agreement with the scientific data
4872479 whereas monumental errors are to be found in the bible i could not find a single error in the quran
4872480 muhammed er ikke far for noen av dere men guds sendebud og profetenes segl
4872481 kan dere troende h pe p at disse j dene vil tro dere n r en del av dem allerede har h rt guds ord
4872482 fordi de br t sin pakt har vi forbannet dem og forherdet deres hjerter s de
4872483 men hvis du muhammed d mmer s d m dem med rettferd
4872484 there is absolutely no suggestion in the quran that the whole bible had been corrupted at some time in the distant past nor that there had been the collusion between christians and jews which would have been necessary in order to corrupt the old testament
4872485 the quranic version is merely an epitome of the above midrash however al baydawi in his commentary gives an almost verbatim translation of the original midrash
4872486 men abraham sa dei har moses og profetane dei kan h yra p dei

4872498 after such a fashion as this i suppose you have had o marcion the hardihood of blotting out the original records of the history of christ that his flesh may lose the proofs of its reality
4872499 you are equally led away by the sound of names when you so understand the riches of damascus and the spoils of samaria and the king of assyria as if they portended that the creators christ was a warrior

4872510 but as regards the appellation son of man in as far as it occurs by accident in so far there is a difficulty in its occurence along with a casual identity of names alts at ogs markions guds utsending vert omtala som

4872576 is p4 p64 and p67 the oldest manuscript of the four gospels a response to t c skeat
4872577 the foreign god and the sudden christ theology and christology in marcions gospel redaction
4872578 marcion and the origins of christian anti judaism a reappraisal
4872579 marcions evangelium und die neutestamentlichen evangelien r ckfragen zur geschichte und kanonisierung der evangelien berlieferung
4872580 i wonder however when he received this letter d e filemonsbrevet hnj which was written but to one man that he rejected the two epistles to timothy and titus which all treat of ecclesiastical discipline his aim was i suppose to carry out his interpolating process even to the number of epistles
4872581 besides this he mutilates the gospel which is according to luke removing all that is written respecting the generation of the lord and setting aside a great deal of the teaching of the lord in which the lord is recorded as most dearly confessing that the maker of this universe is his father he likewise persuaded his disciples that he himself was more worthy of credit than are those apostles who have handed down the gospel to us furnishing them not with the gospel but merely a fragment of it in like manner too he dismembered the epistles of paul removing all that is said by the apostle respecting that god who made the world to the effect that he is the father of our lord jesus christ and also those passages from the prophetical writings which the apostle quotes in order to teach us that they announced beforehand the coming of the lord
4872582 but marcion mutilating that according to luke is proved to be a blasphemer of the only existing god from those passages which he still retains
4872583 what pontic mouse ever had such gnawing powers as he who has gnawed the gospels to pieces
4872584 i affirm that marcions gospel is adulterated marcion that mine is
4872585 it is certain also that with this view d e hans grunnleggjande syn p forholdet mellom gt og nt og dei to gudane he had erased everything that was contrary to his own opinion and made for the creator as if it had been interpolated by his advocates whilst everything which agreed with his own opinion he has retained
4872586 but what serious gaps marcion has made in this epistle especially d e romarbrevet hnj by withdrawing whole passages at his will will be clear from the unmutilated text of our own copy it is enough for my purpose to accept in evidence of its truth what he has seen fit to leave unerased strange instances as they are also of his negligence and blindness
4872587 as our heretic is so fond of his pruning knife i do not wonder when syllables are expunged by his hand seeing that entire pages are usually the matter on which he practises his effacing process
4872588 the heretic marcion identified luke as the author of these books d e luk og apg in the middle of the second century
4872589 marcion on the other hand you must know ascribes no author to his gospel as if it could not be allowed him to affix a title to that from which it was no crime in his eyes to subvert the very body
4872590 although johns use of the old testament is not as frequent or as explicit as that of matthew it is not slight despite charges to that effect and it is enriched by an extraordinarily frequent and subtle number of allusions to the old testament
4872591 zugespitzt formuliert f r marcion ist der mench dadurch dass er vom sch pfergott abstammt schon gerichtet insofern er n hmlich ohne jeden hoffnung auf die grenzen diese gottes festgelegt ist erl sung wird nur dann richtig beschrieben wenn sie als erl sung aus dieser situation verk ndet wird
4872592 so gewiss es ist dass in den dialogen zahlreiche zitate stehen die nicht aus der bibel m s stammen
4872593 after such a fashion as this i suppose you have had o marcion the hardihood of blotting out the original records of the history of christ that his flesh may lose the proofs of its reality
4872594 whereas even the devil according to our gospel recognised jesus in temptation and according to the record which is common to both the evil spirit knew that jesus was the holy one of god
4872595 the law about the lepers had a profound meaning as respects the forms of the disease itself and of the inspection by the high priest the interpretation of this sense it will be our task to ascertain marcions labour however is to object to us the strictness of the law with the view of maintaining that here also christ is its enemy forestalling its enactments even in his cure of the ten lepers
4872596 the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and scribes and priests and be slain and be raised again the third day
4872597 saying the son of man must suffer many things and be slain and be raised after three days
4872598 likewise when extolling the centurions faith how incredible a thing it is that
4872599 what do you say was the substance of that blind mans faith
4872600 now although marcion has denied that christ is here represented as speaking with the lord but only as standing
4872601 the creator at elijahs demand brings down a plague of fire upon that false prophet i take note of a judges sternness and on the contrary of christs gentleness when reproving the disciples as they call for the same punishment upon that village of the samaritans
4872602 blessed are the eyes which see the things which ye see for i tell you that prophets have not seen the things which ye see
4872603 he said to the lawyer what is written in the law
4872604 the saying about jonah the prophet has been falsified marcion had this generation no sign shall be given it but he did not have the passages about nineveh the queen of the south and solomon
4872605 and yet he himself refuses to give to those who seek a sign
4872606 but why is a woe pronounced against them for building the sepulchres of the prophets whom their father had killed
4872607 woe unto you for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets and your fathers killed them
4872608 this woman being a daughter of abraham whom satan hath bound
4872609 again he falsified then shall ye see abraham and isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of god
4872610 again he falsified they shall come from the east and from the west and shall sit down in the kingdom the last shall be first the pharisees came saying get thee out and depart for herod will kill thee
4872611 again he falsified the entire parable of the two sons
4872612 just as if we also did not recognise in john a certain limit placed between the old dispensation and the new at which judaism ceased and christianity began without however supposing that it was by the power of another god that there came about a cessation of the law and the prophets and the commencement of that gospel in which is the kingdom of god christ himself
4872613 more easily therefore may heaven and earth pass away as also the law and the prophets than that one tittle of the lords words should fail
4872614 the subsequent parable of the rich man tormented in hell and the poor man resting in abrahams bosom
4872615 the material about the rich man and lazarus the beggars being carried by the angels into abrahams bosom
4872616 yes you marcion hnj object but i do hope for something from him and this itself amounts to a proof that there are two different christs i hope for the kingdom of god with an eternal heavenly inheritance whereas your christ promises the jews their former estate after the restitution of their country and when life has run its course refreshment with those beneath the earth in abrahams bosom such a very good god if when calmed down he gives back what he took away when angry your god who both smites and heals who creates evil and makes peace a god whose mercy reaches even down to hell
4872617 if however he speaks of his own coming why does he compare it with the days of noe and of lot which were dark and terrible a mild and gentle god as he is why does he bid us remember lots wife who despised the creators command and was punished for her contempt if he does not come with judgment to avenge the infraction of his precepts
4872618 one said unto him good master what shall i do to inherit eternal life
4872619 come now marcion and all you companions in the misery and sharers in the offensiveness of that heretic what will you be bold enough to say
4872620 and it came to pass that as he was come nigh unto jericho a blind man cried jesus thou son of david have mercy on me
4872621 why then did the blind man on hearing that he was passing by exclaim jesus thou son of david have mercy on me
4872622 die tilgung von 9 b folgt daraus dass tert zakch us auf grund des texts m s als heiden ansieht
4872623 now although zacch us was probably a gentile he yet from his intercourse with jews had obtained a smattering of their scripture
4872624 he falsified the section about the ass and bethphage and the one about the city and the temple beacause of the scripture my house shall be called and house of prayer but ye make it a den of thieves
4872625 he started right up and omitted these sections in their entirety beacuse of the testimony that the temple site was christs own property and had been built in his name
4872626 again he excised the material about the vineyard which was let out to husbandmen and the verse
4872627 he excised now that the dead are raised even moses showed at the bush in calling the lord the god of abraham and isaac and jacob
4872628 if however the scribes thought christ was davids son whereas david himself calls him lord what relation has this to christ david did not literally confute an error of the scribes yet david asserted the honour of
4872629 and he said unto peter and the rest go and prepare that we may eat the passover
4872630 after we found this fellow perverting the nation marcion added and destroying the law and the prophets
4872631 and when they were come unto a place called place of a skull they crucified him and parted his raiment and the sun was darkened
4872632 although his raiment was without doubt parted among the soldiers and partly distributed by lot yet marcion had erased it all fron his gospel for he had his eye upon the psalm they parted my garments amongst them and cast lots upon my vesture
4872633 he calls with a loud voice to the father into thine hands i commend my spirit that even when dying he might expend his last breath in fulfilling the prophets
4872634 and when he had cried with a loud voice he gave up the ghost
4872635 he falsified what christ said to cleopas and the other disciples when he met them o fools and slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken ougnht not he to have suffered these things
4872636 o fools and slow of heart in not believing that which he spake unto you
4872637 but when paul hnj also adds for ye are all the children of faith it becomes clear that what the heretics industry erased was the mention of abrahams name for by faith the apostle declares us to be
4872638 but yet it by no means follows because the creator said of old cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree that christ belonged to another god and on that account was accursed even then in the law and how indeed could the creator have cursed by anticipation one whom he knew not of
4872639 that the suffering of the cross was predicted of the christ of the creator
4872640 the mystery which hath for ages been hidden from the god who created all things
4872641 fie on marcions sponge but indeed it is superfluous to dwell on what he has erased d e v 15 og 16 som tertullian siterer hnj when he may be more effectively confuted from that which he has retained her g r tertullian vidare til 4 4 hnj
4872642 besides that to work up credence for his gospel hnj he has contrived a sort of dowry a work entitled
4872643 for that abraham had two sons the one by a bond maid the other by a free woman but he who was of he bond maid was born after the flesh but he of the free woman was by promise which things are allegorized that is to say they presaged something besides the literal history for these are the two covenants or the two exhibitions lat
4872644 however you will have it that it is the gospel of the new god which was then set forth by the apostle
4872645 but first a word about the expression the world because in this passage particularly the heretics expend a great deal of their subtlety in showing that by world is meant the lord of the world
4872646 for it is written he taketh the wise in their own craftiness
4872647 you know that he spoke of the law of moses not of god
4872648 on ressurection of the dead brethren i make known unto you the gospel which i preached unto you also if christ be not raised it is in vain and so on
4872649 i have delivered unto you before all things says he how that christ died for our sins and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day
4872650 therefore the new testament will appertain to none other than him who promised it if not its letter yet its spirit and herein will lie its newness
4872651 i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh joel 2 28 hnj even if the letter killeth yet the spirit giveth life and both belong to him who says i kill and i make alive i wound and i heal 5 mos 32 39 hnj we have already made good the creators claims to this twofold character of judgment and goodness killing in the letter through the law and quickening in the spirit through the gospel now these attributes however different they be cannot possibly make two gods for they have already been found to meet in one he alludes to moses veil covered with which his face could not be stedfastly seen by the children of israel since he did this to maintain the superiority of the glory of the new testament which is permanent in his glory over that of the old which was to be done away this fact gives support to my belief which exalts the gospel above the law and you must look well to it that it does not even more than this for only there is superiority possible where was previously the thing over which superiority can be affirmed but then he says but their minds were blinded of the world certainly not the creators mind but the minds of the people which are in the world of israel he says even unto this day the same veil is upon their heart showing that the veil which was on the face of moses was a figure of the veil which is on the heart of the nation still because even now moses is not seen by them in heart just as he was not seen by them in eye but what concern has paul with the veil that which still obscures moses from their view if the christ of the creator whom moses predicted is not yet come then again the words which follow but when it shall turn to the lord the veil shall be taken away properly refer to the jew over whose gaze moses veil is spread to the effect that when he is turned to the faith of christ he will understand who moses spoke of christ
4872652 sed obtunsi sunt sensus mundi hnj he is not referring to the creator but to the people of israel who are in the world
4872653 they thus subvert his answer respecting the essential question of marriage and apply his words the children of this world and are given in marriage as if they referred to the creators men and his permission to them to marry whilst they themselves whom the god of that world that is the rival god accounted worthy of the resurrection do not marry even here because they are not children of this world
4872654 moreover the world is crucified unto me who am a servant of the creator the world but not the god who made the world and i unto the world not unto the god who made the world
4872655 for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe but first a word about the expression
4872656 but here at least you say he interprets the world to be the god thereof when he says we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men
4872657 i suppose forsooth we find the creator hnj when he speaks of such as were dead in trespasses and sins wherein they had walked according to the prince of the power in the air who worketh in the children of disobedience
4872658 for this the law of the creator had concluded all under sin and had brought in all the world as guilty and had stopped every mouth
4872659 for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth
4872660 for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth
4872661 paul will demonstrate to you very clearly that love is the fulfilling of the law
4872662 the prophet also cries for thy sake we are put to death all the day long
4872663 hence then came the exclamation o the depth of the riches and the wisdom of god for his treasurer were now opening out this is the purport of what isaiah said and of the apostles own subsequent quotation of the self same passage of the prophet who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath been his counsellor who hath first given to him and it shall be recompensed to him again now marcion since you have expunged so much from the scriptures why did you retain these words as if they were not the creators words
4872664 marcion by whom the evangelical and apostolic scripture have been interpolated completely removed this section rom 16 25 27 hnj from this epistle and not only this but he also cut up lat
4872665 but israel sinned against their own god else he would not have burdened them with the charge of killing even the lord in the words who both killed the lord and their own prophets although
4872666 they have not received the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause it will become for them an impulse of delusion
4872667 for this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and they two shall be one flesh this is a great mystery
4872668 for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother
4872669 die prophetie als solche hat m so wenig verworfen s i thess 5 20 i kor 11 5 12 10 wie die gerechtigkeit und das gesetz im sinne des liebesgebots aber von den atlichen propheten wollte er nichts wissen
4872670 now to prove clearly what remains of the argument i shall draw materials from my very adversaries marcions special and principal work is the separation of law and the gospel and his disciples will not deny that in this point they have have their very best pretext for initiating and confirming themselves in his heresy these are marcions antitheses or contradictory propositions which aim at committing the gospel to a variance with the law in order that from diversity of the two documents which contain them they may contend for a diversity of gods also since therefore it is this very opposition between the law and the gospel which has suggested that the god of the gospel is different from the god of the law it is clear that before the said separation that god could not have been known who became known from the argument of the separation itself
4872671 you are equally led away by the sound of names when you so understand the riches of damascus and the spoils of samaria and the king of assyria as if they portended that the creators christ was a warrior
4872672 come now when you read in the words of david how the lord reigneth from the tree i want to know what you understand by it perhaps you think some wooden king of the jews is meant
4872673 then again in opposition to the valentinians and the other gnostics falsely so called who maintain that some parts of scripture were spoken at one time from the pleroma
4872674 this just doesnt look like the way god would have created things
4872675 footnoting to a discredited blog item does not constitute careful scholarship and the bulk of mr corsis book has nothing to do with issues he gets facts wrong he makes offensive statements
4872676 has crawled back out from under his rock to spew vicious lies about barack obama

4872680 as a future leader i pledge never to take this great army of ours into an illegal war
4872681 we can only become the party of the centre ground by renouncing rain and the causes of rain
4872682 it is no long possible for a socially responsible moderate modern party to hanker for the old days of rain more sunshine less rain is what the modern world is about
4872683 being for sun and against rain is what the modern conservative party is about that is after all why i voted to send our troops to iraq more sunshine and less rain is what the modern world is about
4872684 finding jesus in a foetal position with a half eaten bologna sandwich
4872685 ja und ich sage ihnen dass er vor einer halben stunde nicht angesprungen ist zehn minuten sp ter ist er angesprungen

4872708 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4872709 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4872710 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4872711 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4872712 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4872713 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4872714 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4872715 warn defever and i have built over a hundred mbira like instruments in the past few years and some of those end up on the record which uses even more of these homemade instruments we also have constructed a bunch of metallic percussion objects that we then amplify such as the electric saw blade gamelan

4872724 this week a defence forensic anthropologist an archaeologist and several army historians will conduct a full archaeological dig in the location where private fisher is believed to have fallen

4872726 we have got labour shortages and we should be looking at these sorts of schemes but the government should bring australians into what it is looking to do
4872727 email disclaimers are becoming increasingly important for organizations disclaimers can help to minimize legal risks but you can also use them positively to include key marketing messages such as promoting events or new products many organizations also use disclaimers as part of their green environmental policy to remind recipients that they shouldnt print messages unless it is absolutely essential
4872728 the software market for small and medium size businesses is growing far faster than that for large corporations and enterprises softalk is in an ideal position to exploit the growth because we develop software specifically for small and medium size businesses whereas our competitors simply offer cut down or restricted versions of expensive enterprise products its a david and goliath battle as our main competitor is microsoft but our products provide small businesses with a more cost effective and functional solution than microsoft exchange and outlook
4872729 growing the top line enough to make the deloitte technology fast 50 is especially meaningful during competitive times for the technology sector

4872734 even those that do have policies could be at risk if they arent taking any steps to prevent abuse of their email system using an email server such as businesses can easily set up filters to block inappropriate content
4872735 small and medium size businesses have to cope with more and more draconian regulations owners and directors now face fines if their employees forget to include this information in email signatures it is vital that they install and update software that enables them to append legal disclaimers to every email
4872736 when a disclaimer or confidentiality notice is added to every email a company sends then there is a risk that a court would consider that the warning has been diluted this means that it might be better to use a mail disclaimer program that allows you to use rules to attach different disclaimers to different types of email
4872737 officetalk was originally designed as a multi user collaboration product unlike competitors such as outlook goldmine and act which all had limited collaboration features added at a later date
4872738 we have decided to offer the free single user version so that as many people as possible can experience the benefits that officetalk offers the fact that you can look at client information in both contact and company views is a benefit that users dont get with outlook you can also see at a glance all communication you have had with any given contact or company whether that be by e mail telephone or letter it is ideal for those starting a small business as it can be easily and cheaply expanded as the business grows

4872744 ist es m glich da mal hinein zu greifen und die daunen zu bef hlen
4872745 aha und wie sollen wir nun als m glicher kunde feststellen was der unterschied dieser verschienenen daunensorten ist immerhin ist das ja eine ganz sch ne investition
4872746 ein kunde kann nicht feststellen was der unterschied dieser daunen ist
4872747 wenn ich sie recht verstanden habe dann spielt es also keine rolle welche daunen der kunde kauft er merkt ja ohnehin nicht den unterschied
4872748 und da der kunde ja ohnehin keinen unterschied feststellen kann inkompetent wie er ist kann man ihm auch die daunen zu 199 euro anstatt zu 59 euro verkaufen er merkt es ja nicht richtig
4872749 the new version of workgroupmail is designed to make it easier and cheaper for small and medium size businesses to manage their email and protect themselves from viruses and spam it costs less than microsoft exchange and because it is much easier to use it requires a lot less it support and administration which is essential for small and medium size businesses who cant afford the high overhead cost of administering exchange

4872751 we use officetalk to keep track of everything the history tab that shows all previous contact can be viewed for your contact as an individual or when looking at the relevant company when we first started looking for a crm system we went across all of the main players act goldmine outlook and a few more obscure ones but basically officetalk ticked a lot more boxes and because of its standard database it fitted much better with what we wanted to do and could be customized to achieve more so we went for it and weve been very pleased with it
4872752 ive used officetalk since its earliest version back in 1998 and despite straying occasionally to use outlook ive always returned to officetalk because of its powerful contact management which lets me see my contacts as part of the company they work for with a complete history of emails letters phone calls tasks and meetings as well as all of the pending activity
4872753 without officetalk we would have major difficulties in delivering our service to the public in the way that we need to outlook just isnt designed for collaboration thats the crux of the difference between outlook and officetalk i like the cleaner more modern look of the new officetalk 4 5 version there are also some fixes and improvements that weve been asking for with no success until softalk took the product back and very quickly delivered the goods
4872754 i began to live a duel life by day i investigated the local dioceses dug up documents in courthouses talked with a seemingly endless string of victims and interviewed bishops their aides attorneys and priests in my off hours i put in my final months of training to become a catholic
4872755 we were checking fences when this thing jumped out at us
4872756 i shouted its a chupacabra i recognised it instantly from tv it had big teeth a big head short legs in the front and long legs in back
4872757 im so shocked we did what we wanted to do
4872758 we were ahead after 1000 meters and after that it was a case of you catch me you beat me just keep going
4872759 i heard a lot of avalanches around us i thought im too young to die
4872760 i suppose you would say its mixed emotions through the group
4872761 some of them are extremely relieved to be down here and others are sort of annoyed that we required rescuing

4872769 so miss johnson what have you done to improve the lives of people in your community under the age of six
4872770 i see here that you were a brownie troop leader very good very good indeed how do you think your experience as a brownie leader will help you when the bus shows up at school for a field trip you forgot to cancel how does this kind of leadership help the school secretary who set the trip up and who is in charge of all the money you never gave her what kind of food can you leave on her desk to make her understand how truly sorry you are
4872771 of course you are a proud american sir when you travel how do you present yourself to others would you say you were the camera wearing map reading backpack lugging loud speaking version of an american or would you say you represented the quiet thoughtful still water running deep kind of american who speaks or hears no evil who walks everywhere because they cant figure the money out and who keeps ordering the same food all the time because its the only one you know what plan do you have to convince the rest of the world they should be like us or at least put written stuff in english
4872772 the cover keeps off the heat and channels away rainwater
4872773 every autumn we make note of where the glacier has melted the most and cover those places the following spring
4872774 geographer hans joachim fuchs in the western german city mainz has another idea he wants to harness the power of cold mountain winds so called kabatic winds or streams of cold dense air that flow downhill with windscreens the screens would keep the cool air on top of the glaciers perhaps preserving them for a little while longer fuchs has been proposing this idea for years and this week hes putting it to the test on monday fuchs and 27 students headed to the rhone glacier in switzerland to install a windscreen measuring 15 meters long 50 feet and 3 meters high at an elevation of 2 300 meters 7 545 feet on the leading edge of the glacier hell be measuring the effectiveness of the screen to see if its a viable solution
4872775 im sure that america will see that like me barack obama is a man of truth and family values
4872776 im sure that america will see that like me barack obama is a man of truth and family values
4872777 my loyalty is to the democrats winning barack obama is going to have a serious problem getting elected for good reason
4872778 the party needs to face the fact that without hillary clinton on the ticket the democrats will probably lose
4872779 there is a sense of entitlement that almost seems to be inbred
4872780 they are convinced hillary is the one who should be assuming the mantle and its tough to crack that
4872781 its not something that i would have recommended but theyre trying to bend over backwards as far as they can to accommodate her
4872782 i think the roll call will be a cathartic moment
4872783 there will be a lot of people who will say oh what might have been and will vote for obama but there will be a lot of tears
4872784 were not going to win by pretending problems with barack obama dont exist he has a huge problem connecting with ordinary americans who think he doesnt understand me he is not modest he is arrogant he radiates elitism
4872785 it is not disloyal to raise legitimate questions about barack obama
4872786 he started running for president before he even set foot in the us senate
4872787 no matter what he says he has not explained properly why he sat next to reverend jeremiah wright his former pastor for 20 years he talks about an end to partisanship but he has no record of reaching across the aisle for any purpose
4872788 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his centre fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
4872789 barack obama can use the words the american dream but they dont resonate
4872790 he magnified the problem by going to berlin and calling himself a citizen of the world
4872791 he has provided her with a pittance compared to what the clintons have given obama
4872792 her debt could have been cleared within 10 days its ungracious
4872793 barack obama would not stand up and say its outrageous its not permissible and speak up for him
4872794 but ultimately he understands what he has got to do in terms of supporting the candidate and the party
4872795 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
4872796 without doubt obama is more comfortable talking the language of religion than mccain in the past republicans talked about god and jesus and the democrats were silent this year their roles are reversed
4872797 the rate of serious spyware problems has declined 54 and serious virus problems 32 over the years that weve tracked them
4872798 the actual risk of having your identity stolen online is not as high as many people think
4872799 financial services companies are trying to reassure consumers but their marketing messages arent sticking companies need to find innovative new ways to convince americans that their identities are secure online and when using e mail

4872818 only consult a registered chinese physician for prescriptions different physicians will administer different herbal remedies but the effect is about the same
4872819 some of my customers say they drink the water as an alternative cure for the disease while others drink it for prevention
4872820 they say coconut water helps to bring down the fever and give them relief
4872821 as long as i am strong enough to help others i see no reason why i should stop
4872822 is that there is a school colour at st georges girls school that is named after her
4872823 i used to go out dancing almost every evening with my husband
4872824 these days i am very happy when music is played at parties and we all join in and dance
4872825 the bus ride to kampot from phnom penh which normally takes two hours stretched to five because we stopped at two mosques along the way to pray and meet muslims in the little towns
4872826 we could only smile at each other because neither spoke the others language
4872827 the joy on their faces told us we had done the right thing in upgrading their mosque which was simply an attap roof structure and was very basic
4872828 my mother was not happy that the washrooms cooking area and womens prayer room were very basic and now she wants all these facilities to be upgraded too
4872829 we will get a silver at least im extremely satisfied and give my team full marks
4872830 we were expecting a qualifying height of 2 31m but that has been changed still hup wei has a chance if the field finds the height too difficult
4872831 we waited for seven hours but only one race was held we were ready for the next race but the organisers didnt start
4872832 i tried too hard and took a lot of risks in the earlier races but i have to take it easy and see hows the situation in the remaining races
4872833 if anyone would have said before the games that id win two gold medals and break the world record id have laughed in their face i never thought it
4872834 i knew when i touched the wall i was going to win the gold but i didnt expect to get the record and by that much its unbelievable
4872835 kim hyon ung was barred from participating in the games after it became known belatedly that he failed a doping test carried out during the asian championships
4872836 north korean officials at that time claimed that hyon ung had taken some medicine for illness and this might have caused him to fail the test
4872837 i was a bit nervous before the race but it was my best race ever my dream was to be an olympic champion and that is now realised
4872838 i gave my heart out for the race i didnt prepare for a losing speech but really i gave it my best
4872839 but this is not the end as i enjoyed myself out there i have two more olympics in me
4872840 but he didnt and that cost him beasley has taken him to task
4872841 i feel a little bit of everything relief excitement everything
4872842 i had to take my goggles off to make sure the 1 was next to my name
4872843 when i saw the 50 58 and the 50 59 and i saw the 1 next to my name thats when i sort of let my roar out
4872844 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i had lost the race right there but i guess that was the difference in the end
4872845 i was starting to hurt for the last 10 metres it was my last individual race and i just wanted to finish as strong as i could
4872846 i think the biggest thing is when someone says you cant do something
4872847 it shows that anything is possible when you put your mind to it
4872848 im thrilled with the way im playing but you cant relax until sunday today night
4872849 i could have played a safe pitch out third shot to about 15 feet but i had momentum with me and it wasnt that hard a shot
4872850 i chunked it in the bunker and then didnt get up and down but it was nice to come back with birdies on 16 and 17 to end the round on a good note
4872851 i was close last time and i kept looking at the rankings so im trying to forget about it
4872852 people said i arrived from europe where the climate is cooler and that i would struggle in the heat and humidity but its the training in europe that has made me a better athlete and given me the confidence to tackle any situation
4872853 i knew that if i stuck close to jacobs after the swim i would have a chance of catching up with him in the bike
4872854 the london olympics in 2012 is my ultimate aim thats where i want to be
4872855 farlow got stronger after each discipline but i have to admit that i didnt feel good in the bike race and it got worse
4872856 this is an alternative to consider instead of the plan to log for timber at the water catchment area
4872857 if the forest reserve is converted into a national park it will be protected and can be a source of income for the state government
4872858 the forest reserve is a repository of biodiversity and should be gazetted into a national park
4872859 we cannot allow logging there water from the catchment is not only used in kedah but also in perlis and penang water is also piped to langkawi
4872860 there is evidence of a rare species of hornbill the plain pouched hornbill
4872861 a sense of direction emerged which was largely but not universally agreed and which should translate into greater cohesion within the anglican communion giving it stronger boundaries and a stronger sense of identity
4872862 we went into the lambeth conference in a wait and see mode and we came out of it with some encouragement but still waiting
4872863 the importance of the role of the episcopacy the need for authority in the church and a concern for fidelity with the churchs tradition throughout the ages
4872864 subtly suggesting that we bring individuals into the catholic church some may come but what he was asking was that anglicans be attentive to the treasures that lie within their tradition as well as ours
4872865 in a democratic republic we are responsible for the actions of our government neither future historians nor our descendants will care for our excuses
4872866 we elect our representatives nor have their been widespread protests against the post wwii expansion of the military industrial complex nor can we complain that we have not been told president eisenhowers warning was clear and there have been countless stories in the mainstream media about this over the past few decades if our response to these things is to blame others instead of our own fecklessness then perhaps we are not capable of self government
4872867 americans have voted protested written and used every peaceful means to try to reform their government
4872868 at last the closed doors of independence hall were opened and the delegates as they issued from the building found themselves surrounded by a crowd of citizens eager to know what had been the outcome of the constitutional conventions long deliberations among them was mrs powel of philadelphia she approached dr franklin with an anxious question well doctor what have we got a republic or a monarchy
4872869 peoples power exists only collectively acting together collective responsibility is one spur to collective action otherwise we get what many germans did under hitler enjoy the benefits then deny responsibility when things end badly
4872870 the concept of collective action is so foreign to us
4872871 a growing number of people are not taken in by a pretence of an increasingly illusionary freedom they have stopped taking an interest in government our leaders wish that we vote whatever they believe necessary to maintain the empty charade of a free election but over time more and more people stay away history has no more common spectacle than this
4872872 what does it mean when a fictional hero takes a journey shares a meal gets drenched in a sudden rain shower often there is much more going on in a novel or poem than is readily visible on the surface a symbol maybe that remains elusive or an unexpected twist on a character and theres a sneaking suspicion that the deeper meaning of a literary text keeps escaping you in this practical and amusing guide to literature thomas c foster shows how easy and gratifying it is to unlock those hidden truths and to discover a world where a road leads to a quest a shared meal may signify a communion and rain whether cleansing or destructive is never just rain ranging from major themes to literary models narrative devices and form how to read literature like a professor is the perfect companion for making your reading experience more enriching satisfying and fun
4872873 when theyre writing about other things they really mean sex and when they write about sex they really mean something else if they write about sex and mean strictly sex we have a word for that pornography
4872874 when demand for homes drops ordinary sellers will take their homes off the market let them sit or reduce their prices in small increments but banks will slash prices to where the homes will sell quickly
4872875 now were getting into a time when the real economy is starting to affect housing markets more
4872876 its a little bit of a contest now will lower prices stimulate home sales or will the slowing economy slow down sales
4872877 the biggest home sales gains over the previous quarter have been in some of the markets with the steepest and fastest price drops
4872878 buyers in these areas are responding to deeply discounted home prices
4872879 loan officers are reporting that they are still tightening underwriting standards
4872880 we expect that sales volume which has leveled off some will drop another 10 over the next few months over this credit squeeze
4872881 bank repossessions or reos continued to be the fastest growing segment of foreclosure activity
4872882 the sharp rise in reos combined with slow sales has resulted in a bloated inventory of bank owned properties for sale
4872883 the properties there once they enter foreclosure are making a beeline back to the banks
4872884 theres got to be at least 25 000 hidden in your house we can help you find it
4872885 calling it a second mortgage thats like hocking your house
4872886 but call it equity access and it sounds more innocent
4872887 its very difficult for one advertiser to come to you and change your perspective
4872888 but as it becomes socially acceptable for everyone to accumulate debt everyone does
4872889 youve put a lot of work into your home isnt it time for your home to return the favor
4872890 the second mortgage category then as probably now suffered from a pretty bad reputation
4872891 it generally tended to be a credit facility of last resort and it was done by people in dire straits that was not the audience we were after
4872892 you dont have to sell your home to get 10 000 30 000 or even more in cash you dont even have to walk out the door
4872893 now when the value of your home goes up you can take credit for it
4872894 banking started using consumer advertising techniques more like a department store than like a bank
4872895 we thought it would bring to the equity access category the same kind of reputation over time that had come to the second mortgage category
4872896 when you went to market research and asked people questions would you like to have 24 by 7 access to your money would you like to have access to home mortgages and credit cards even if the product didnt exist as such would you like a line of credit where you can just write a check anytime
4872897 theres no question then that that caused credit to enlarge
4872898 the extent of how bad these loans are doing is very troubling
4872899 home prices will drop for quite a while maybe several years
4872900 price declines lead to more defaults which leads to more price declines
4872901 time will break the cycle pricing will drop enough to attract more buyers and inventories will decline
4872902 for homeowners who need to sell this is a gravely serious situation
4872903 it can also be harmful to communities where the number of unsold homes adds more to inventory and puts downward pressure on prices
4872904 the numbers are the worst weve seen and its not just the magnitude of the problem but the scope so many markets are affected
4872905 im taking a major loss ill probably have to bring a check to the closing
4872906 the bank is willing to do a short sale and we have an offer of 170 000 on the house but we believe the bank will turn that down
4872907 they hand over their keys and walk away from the homes
4872908 it takes time for people to recognize that these losses are real
4872909 i dont think this is a time to be holding onto reos and hoping for a better day
4872910 its the best way to buy and its time to buy again
4872911 you call them or knock on their doors and say i know youre having a problem and i think i can help you
4872912 all many of them want is financial relief from bad mortgages and youre offering it
4872913 it makes a lot more financial sense for them to liquidate early rather than go through the foreclosure process
4872914 the transaction was very smooth and quick and i think i saved a lot of money
4872915 anybody can go the home depot hd fortune 500 and buy some paint and a new rug
4872916 the first time i bought renovated and sold the house all within 29 days and made a killing
4872917 i thought i was a mini donald trump the second time the previous owner poured cement into the pipes before he left and when i turned on the water it clogged everything i lost more on the second house than i made on the first
4872918 get a young hungry real estate agent whos screening reos all the time and put them to work for you
4872919 to coach a friend or not to coach a friend
4872920 a milestone for a gay and lesbian political movement thats anticipating a banner year

4872924 the reason this scandal was as devastating as it was was there wasnt transparency in the beginning not because they were coddling criminals although that was the impact
4872925 the church with all its wonderful qualities one of its not so wonderful qualities is its adherence to secrecy which has certainly contributed to the problem
4872926 i think in the studies that i read after 2002 i came to that conclusion for the first time
4872927 all those formed in my mind the conviction that the recidivism rate was too great to ever chance allowing someone to recommit this crime
4872928 this is something that i have to live with because its a terrible crime and it was on my watch

4872985 we had that ready to go and we had that created thats probably what gave us the advantage over other japanese developers who are maybe struggling with the next gen consoles to a certain extent and maybe only now are getting to grips with it
4872986 that was something that actually came from the development teams rather than from upper management it was something that the developers thought of
4872987 before the mt framework we were all working on games separately and creating them separately and it was a very inefficient process to have lots of different teams separately developing tools to make games
4872988 there are a lot of other japanese developers who are opposed to that way of thinking theres not an advantage to it certainly i think where it comes from is that the developers in one team always want to think that theyre the best and that their way of making the game is the best way to make their game
4872989 theres a lot of rivalry within teams working within the same company before that used to be an advantage and it used to be a plus point that youd get rivalries between different teams who are working in competition with each other that did help improve the quality of the product ultimately but these days i really dont think its an advantage at all

4872996 we dont have to play that game its more about finding someone whos really passionate about a product we took this game to ea and they just lit up i think they were excited about a relationship with epic that wasnt just using our technology
4872997 we were working with pcf and we asked them to come up with some new ip ideas
4872998 we picked one we really liked we developed it for a little while and we showed it around to a few publishers
4872999 we called valves gabe newell and scott lynch and biowares ray muzyka is a good friend i know him well
4873000 if you dont want design direction help they cross it off the list and you just wont have that assigned to the project and they just wont worry about it i mean theyve got friggin valve theyre going to make a good game we dont want somebody telling us how to light levels
4873001 i think theres a real maturity there because there are publishers that try to control the process
4873002 theyll say well this is what we used on this budget title coming out of eastern europe and we feel like we need it to use it on your title because youre on stage 3 and youre doing it wrong and im like ive been making games longer than youve been a publisher just do the things i need you to do and the ea guys get it
4873003 theres something you see within ea since ceo john riccitiello has joined a concerted effort to prop the studio and the creative team up

4873095 sia started back in september looking at various solutions involving a traditional windows box with windows servers sitting in the background we werent particularly happy with that because obviously there is a spiralling cost to having windows boxes youve got the ram the hard drives and the power supplies so much can go wrong incurring a time cost to repair in terms of the actual unit and also in the fact that you have to replace the component
4873096 i put it across in two steps first that it matches our environmental aims and goals at sia and second that we would have 100 ownership which means that over a 10 year period our it infrastructure would be greatly reduced because we wouldnt have all of those costs associated with upgrade paths for example as we move from xp to vista it would normally mean that all the machines would have to be upgraded or replaced with new machines to meet vistas requirements
4873097 what we actually believe is that we should not only tell children about environmental issues we should be showing them that were taking steps to actively be part of the solution
4873098 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4873207 they can buckle down and work one year beyond the typical retirement age of 65 or they could choose to save 850 more per month now or adjust their spending down at retirement
4873208 but theyre definitely going to be able to save a lot more money once jared leaves the house
4873209 son mommy and daddy care more about shiny cars than your education
4873210 ariss big indulgence is the lottery 7 in tickets each week he calls it his investment that hasnt paid off just yet
4873211 aris is trying learn more about investing and has recently started to trade options they can take years to learn and can be risky
4873212 we went from disaster to success in a relatively short time
4873213 all we need is time for our money to compound
4873214 i think to be able to have the comfortable retirement and especially to provide some inheritance they will need to shoot for something more like 2 million
4873215 i got the need to gamble out of my life early on
4873216 i know i have a good 20 or 30 years to recoup losses
4873217 any stock can crash any market can have a problem but you can always live in the house
4873218 i think of money as a tool to help you get everything else you need
4873219 im concerned that because so much of their wealth is in their home theyre underdiversified all it would take is for the real estate market to go south and theyd be in a difficult situation
4873220 banks recommend that you spend less than 36 percent of your monthly income on expenses
4873221 people are retiring earlier and living longer what happens if they live to be 100 the house will be paid off but you cant eat a house
4873222 the cash emergency fund is critical i have seen people lose their homes because of unforeseen medical expenses

4873226 my family has been very blessed to be in the financial position we are in now and we decided very early to stay ahead of the game and think long term in regards to money
4873227 it was important for me that we go into the relationship with a sound financial plan
4873228 this helps a lot and saves us about 25 cents a gallon
4873229 we have been planning for a family and never really put a premium on going out
4873230 we want to have as much money as possible to retire comfortably and as soon as possible we want to maintain our lifestyles through retirement and not be restricted by money and bills
4873231 people generally need five times their earnings plus the total amount of their household debt plus enough to cover college tuition for their children
4873232 most parents get serious about saving for college costs once their child is entering high school this is way too late
4873233 i would like to see how far 90k year goes living in an area where a 200k mortgage will buy you a 600 square foot 1 bedroom co op at most come live in the real world and see how well you save
4873234 definetly open a savings account with ing direct there are no transfer fees or minimums and i started at a 4 5 interest rate about a year ago its variable and its currently at 3 0 beat that and i am all ears
4873235 btw im 46 and hs dropout but i earn 150k yr from my job and my investments spin off another 15k mo never had a vacation ever i do have a nice 700k home though in a gated community to keep you people out my kids go to private school so they dont have to get bogged down by your kids my wife doesnt have to work so my kids actually have a real mom not someone who feeds them and put them to bed and most importantly i have a family that loves one another and goes to sleep everynight knowing they are safe and secure financially and otherwise
4873236 so what what if i knock a few years off my life so i live to 65 not 70 big deal
4873237 sorry is the fool who trades his soul for a corvette he thinks hell get the girl hell only get the mechanic
4873238 just wait until your daughter has to have abercrombie amp fitch
4873239 if every american could simply max out their ira since they obtain their first job out of college and invest it with half a brain theyll retire a millionnaire sic every single one of them
4873240 i would know i sell it a 20 year term for someone like this family for 400k could run as low as 30 month that is such a small expense when you take into consideration the difference that money would make in the event of an untimely death i think its completely ignorant to discount the value of life insurance and on top of that there are tax benefits and investment strategies that are directly tied to permanent life insurance that you obviously dont know about either anyway i better go lots of 20 year terms to sell which will pay me a whopping 180 dollars im rich
4873241 while kids are in school they should have to pay their own way through loans hard work etc
4873242 i dont care enough about you to curb my own enjoyment
4873243 people sitting on the couch for the next 60 years
4873244 live like no one else today and you will live like no one else tomorrow
4873245 dont take life so seriously no one makes it out alive
4873246 sitting on the couch and making money is nice but what about friends weddings birthdays and anniversary parties they all cost money presents wait till they want to go out and you loose friends as life changes and they dont want to go to your house for dinner its easier in a small state than a large city where flash and glammor rules the city where bmw and lexus define who you are
4873247 i dont know how ppl in this world predict life
4873248 i do indeed wish that i had the benefits of getting tax breaks and cheap gas for being a descendent of irish immigrants
4873249 if they need to stay at home most of the time to save money it is not an expense issue it is an income problem
4873250 continue saving for retirement but try to enjoy life a bit just in case you dont make it to retirement age
4873251 insure your child so that s he can always have insurance
4873252 the loss of a child is bad enough why suffer financially
4873253 spending the next 60 years sitting on the couch in wisconsin sounds great
4873254 double digit contributions into their 401k with only a 3 match i would scale back those and max out their roth then buy some more life insurance through a mutual company
4873255 i had to believe in myself that i could do this
4873256 i would like to be able to retire worry free
4873257 the real reason we have trouble saving for retirement is paying our taxes of which someone earning 47k the median family income has none beyond ssi and medicare
4873258 anyone making double or triple 47k should have no problem saving for retirement
4873259 fialkow recommends putting it into a virginia tax free bond mutual fund
4873260 i dont think i was as crazy about saving in the past because i didnt make enough
4873261 but now that i make more in the navy i try to keep my sights on being a saver
4873262 they werent always into buying flashy things and i learned from them that you dont always have to have the best of the best
4873263 once that loan is paid off they should shift that 440 per month immediately into roth ira contributions for justin and emily even then theyll have room to grow these contributions since each would be able to put 5 000 each into their roth iras beginning in 2008
4873264 i would recommend they use future pay raises and or elimination of expenses or debts as an opportunity to increase their savings and investments
4873265 right now its in a mix of stock and bond mutual funds taking more risk than they should with a short two year time horizon
4873266 with the tsp and roth ira start up from the honda car payment the bergmans will be on track to have a nest egg of over 300 000 when they retire the first time at 41
4873267 with the same savings strategies they should achieve millionaire status in their 50s
4873268 being rich isnt about being debt free being rich is about having a passive income to pay for 100 of your housing and maybe for transportation a portion of the money that you earn from working can then be reinvested to increase your pasiive income eventually it will not matter that you are in debt because you will have the money to pay the debt down over time have money to invest and have money to have fun with
4873269 if i inherited 50 000 i would pay off all of my debts first so i would technically be
4873270 we have x amount saved you can go to community college state school and have it all paid for or go to duke for 1 year and then youre on your own
4873271 justin pays 230 a month for a used 2005 toyota corolla which he plans to pay off in almost four years
4873272 we believe that if the kids have to contribute a portion of their tuition theyll appreciate their schooling more
4873273 id love to travel someplace cool or hike the appalachian trail as a family
4873274 if hes going to do his college funding on a pay as you go basis he may not be able to maintain the contribution level that hes currently using for his 401 k and ira
4873275 if he really wants to put his investments on cruise control he should go with a 2035 going to be less volatile
4873276 hes done a very good job in planning his savings and can really have the best of both worlds in paying for his kids expenses as well as his retirement
4873277 try profiling people who start their own businesses or something to that effect
4873278 how about some people who dont make 200k in these articles
4873279 this article characterizes see quotation below the success as largely the husbands as a female attorney im well aware that my spouse plays a large role in our financial management please acknowledge this role more clearly in the future
4873280 overall boucher said this benefits lawyer and his family are on a very good path hes done a very good job in planning his savings and can really have the best of both worlds in paying for his kids expenses as well as his retirement
4873281 a man told me that every time i get a raise i should put that money into my deferred compensation and i will have something
4873282 i saw my mother struggle with credit cards and i didnt want to go that way
4873283 weve both been married before so the second time around is going to be us going away no tuxes no dresses or any of that other stuff
4873284 so when i leave state service i will basically get a pay raise from what im used to bringing home
4873285 his roth should be invested into high growth and or international investments based on franks risk posture
4873286 they have almost no liquidity frank should get a line of credit against the house just for liquidity and emergency use
4873287 in the event that something happens to them they would likely get 60 percent of their pay which is then taxed
4873288 their after tax cash flow may not be enough to sustain savings and the standard of living they are accustomed to now
4873289 a roth is always advisable but as you can see they are already saving more than enough to exceed their retirement goals
4873290 in the event of his fianc passing thereafter the estate does not pass exclusively to his fianc s family and not to the franks two sons
4873291 when josh is employed he will transfer the money to a roth ira
4873292 josh is employed he is serving our great country and gets a paycheck for it
4873293 not everyone can have health care paid for by the taxpayers
4873294 franks ex wife sends a child support check of 475 every month for both sons
4873295 once you trigger the jealousy emotion you cant apologize or take it back
4873296 money changes the people around you when they dont have it
4873297 the only thing they really should do is cut back on the retirement saving for just a little bit to get that emergency fund up to 6 months
4873298 although frank stopped contributing to jakes 529 for now he plans to fund 75 percent of his college education
4873299 frank should get a line of credit against the house just for liquidity and emergency use
4873300 if were going on a trip we begin squirreling away money months in advance i dont want to deprive my kid of an ice cream cone just because we havent planned
4873301 we moved into something a little more modest because we knew we wanted to start a family
4873302 when im 60 or 65 if my kids are in california i want to be able to have the option of getting on a plane and visiting them
4873303 obviously they started a ways back because hes only 35 and they already have 150 000 in their 401 k
4873304 if they want to count on living off of both of their incomes each year in retirement elizabeth is really going to have to save a lot when she returns to work
4873305 she has about 22 years until retirement so she should be putting away about 10 percent of her full time salary
4873306 its important because theyre not getting the amount that elizabeth would be able to contribute
4873307 money that youve put towards a home equity loan isnt an emergency fund because youll eventually have to pay it back
4873308 they should have enough cash to cover them if someone were no longer working
4873309 depending on how much house they want to buy it could really take a chunk of their retirement income
4873310 they need to make a decision do i want my money to be in a house or do i want to retire at 60 rather than 65
4873311 good going when we give god his part he always blesses the rest posted by dorothy millersville md october 15 2007 11 49 am
4873312 justin has been in the navy for seven years and plans on staying for another 13 years so he can receive a pension which will be 50 percent of his base pay at the time of his retirement
4873313 lets plan for the cheapest things we can do with the kids even if there are other things that cost money they really want to do
4873314 the problem manifests itself during an app install or update regardless or not it is being done on the iphone itself or from itunes
4873315 i feel pretty comfortable with a target of a little over 2 million
4873316 right now i am really trying to build a strong foundation in our portfolio so that when children or anything else comes along we are in a very strong position
4873317 we each have some room to grow based on income potential
4873318 especially with the market heading down they have to build up their cash reserves first
4873319 although they are moving their balances to new cards with 0 interest if they continue to open new cards to do this they are bringing their credit score down
4873320 their credit score will take a hit for having cards that are maxed out getting inquiry hits and opening new cards
4873321 cook at home or get movies from the library theyre free
4873322 theyre doing pretty good frankly they did pretty well with their home and its great that theyre saving so much
4873323 point is those of you in expensive areas need to realize that you cant get ahead finaicially in life by living in expensive metros
4873324 im glad i didnt have any kids look at the money i saved
4873325 also remember to have fun because with fun life is not worth living
4873326 125 000 wont buy much in most of the country
4873327 she is only 5 years from retirement so we will leave her alone
4873328 my wife and i are 34 and make 220k between the two of us
4873329 and bouncing around debt to different 0 promo cards probably isnt the best idea but hurting their credit is minor at best because what do people get good credit scores for
4873330 does not compute this math does not add up they earn 56 000 is that gross or take home if that is gross i dont see how he can have 22 500 in ira at 25 unless they have had help from relatives also their mortgage payment is 570 on 125 000 what is their rate 4 what about property taxes and home insurance pmi insurance life insurance health insurance i bet they have cell phones
4873331 they do live in pottsville ar they are probaly buying most of their groceries stright from the farmer down the road who happens to be their uncle for less than half of what you will spend at your local supermarket

4873335 ok since its very hard to get a real i
4873336 forget the funds for now especially with the market heading down
4873337 we were not great savers before we got married we both saved minimally and we had a small emergency fund that was nowhere near six months of living expenses
4873338 when we got married it forced us to sit down and discuss our financial situation and our future financial goals
4873339 both my wife and i are obsessive about saving for retirement
4873340 we look forward to the day where getting up for work is an option
4873341 we would much rather sit at home drinking coffee together with our two basset hounds than sitting in rush hour traffic
4873342 we also try to strike the delicate balance between saving for the future and living in the present not an easy task
4873343 they need to be prepared for tough choices such as eating out much less often to slowing their contributions to their retirement funds for a two to four year period until theyve adjusted
4873344 the level of leadership in the military borders on remedial

4873346 both of these people could be fixing schools in dc instead of dropping bombs in iraq and most of us would have no problem at all with their salaries
4873347 the big picture is that our government spends 400b a year on the military and it all comes from taxes if that money were spent in the us investing in our education health care and national infrastructure we would be an incredibly wealthy country with no poverty
4873348 they just werent capable of doing anything else living among normal full tax paying people
4873349 if that money were spent in the us investing in our education health care and national infrastructure we would be an incredibly wealthy country with no poverty both of these people could be fixing schools in dc instead of dropping bombs in iraq and most of us would have no problem at all with their salaries

4873353 they also invest 500 a month in mutual funds which now total nearly 44 000
4873354 for now they keep their living expenses relatively low a combined 1000 per month on rent and about 460 for utilities they also spend about 600 a month on groceries and 500 on gas and maintenance costs for their two cars they bought a nissan xterra in 2005 and then an acura tl in 2006 both new

4873356 for those who fight for it freedom has a flavor the protected will never understand
4873357 for people to just outright complain that this couple is paid too much is unpatriotic because theyre making that comment without fully understanding where their tax dollars are going
4873358 i am active enlisted in the military with a little over 5 years of service my monthy income after taxes is a very modest 1 800 dollars a month so people please dont get things twisted here while some duel military couples can yes make a very decent living there are still the majority of us trying to scrape by paycheck to paycheck

4873433 john in an imaginative allusive approach to the text of genesis that is akin to philos approach before him does indeed lay out the equivalent of the seven days of creation the elements of each day in genesis have their historical counterparts in john such that these echo in allegorical fashion the details of the creation story in the first five chapters of his gospel johannine historical reporting is an allegorization of the creation story just as philos interpretations of genesis 1 are primarily allegorical
4873434 the curious emphasis in jn 1 19 28 on the negative role of john the baptist suggests the void of day one of creation the descent of the spirit like a dove on the wate r jn recalls the spirit that hovered over the face of the primeval waters on the same day the turning of two of the baptists disciples to jesus with whom they spend that day jn suggests their exposure to the light that was called day in gen 1 5 because jesus personifies the light of day one the promised opening of the heavens to nathanel in jn 1 51 points to the firmament of the heavens on day two in genesis the miracle of water turned into wine in jn 2 1 11 points to the water and the earth that yields fruit on day three of genesis the details interest in signs season days and years in the violent incident at th jn 2 123 25 relates back to their appearance on day four of creation the baptists use of water to produce converts jn is reminiscent of the creation of the water creatures on day five finally the strange encounter between jesus and the samaritan woman and her conversion of her fellow samaritans to belief in him as the messiah jn 4 1 32 recall the role of the male and female on day six of creation and their potential fruitfulness in reproducing their own kind
4873435 refers to how jesus discourses on the works which god has given him to complete jn 5 36 teleioo as in the lxx of gen 2 2 the works are those of creation when john describes the healing of the invalid on the sabbath he includes references to signs seasons days and years the features of the universe that came into existence on the fourth day of creation

4873487 fast forward almost a year and the mccain campaign has begun to implement some of the same tactics
4873488 i think it shows the campaign is willing to play with the technology and enable their supporters to participate in that flurry of web activity a little supporter participation can go a long way towards feeding energy into a campaign

4873602 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4873603 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4873604 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4873605 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4873606 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4873607 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4873608 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4873609 these figures are frightening for any parent across this state
4873610 there is only so much government can do and ultimately people must be responsible for their own actions
4873611 weve already had more than 200 people die on queensland roads this year with speeding a major factor in many of these crashes
4873612 mr tandy is a client of ours and we are in the process of launching civil proceedings
4873613 as a result of the assault by joey barton our client has suffered a major psychiatric deterioration in his health that has destroyed any chance he may have had of playing professional football at a high level
4873614 it is an important game because i hope to get the answers from the players that i hope to achieve
4873615 i have to check on the form before the qualifiers but experimenting is finished
4873616 when i started working with the players they were a bit scared and afraid after a lot of players played better
4873617 its not fear about me but it was soon after not qualifying and for the players it was like an examination or test it is not so
4873618 i think they know me what i ask of them about my style the movement around the pitch they know and its better now
4873619 the first and second games were different teams and it was hard enough i think they know better because at the end of the season we had 10 days together
4873620 when playing with their clubs there is no losing mentality i think if you can train with them every day it is easy to change the mentality with every moment of training with the different work
4873621 i try to transfer the mentality into the national team because you have to play the same spirit that you see in the clubs
4873622 i saw the games for the european qualifiers the matches at the start of the season like against russia and they played very well and with spirit
4873623 you have to play with that spirit and that mentality i think it is impossible to lose that just because we did not qualify for the european championships
4873624 in the last four friendlies we have played i have seen one step forward every time towards recovering the mentality
4873625 i think three months ago people never spoke about spain now they are the best team in the world its a miracle
4873626 spain is a very good team they played well but we are different and i think you can win against spain why not im very confident in my team
4873627 i think rooney can be both its possible to play like a second forward and score goals
4873628 he played very well in two games he didnt score but i was very happy with the performance
4873629 you have to play in a different style the other players they have to score more goals
4873630 you have to come in front of the goal with a lot of players
4873631 its a problem everywhere italy so so in attack germany so so only torres is a big striker in this moment in the world
4873632 on thursday he hurt his ankle in training it is not serious i think but he did not train the next day
4873633 overall deco is now in very good condition and gives a balance to the team which is important for us
4873634 he cannot make all the difference on his own but with the team he can because he always has time
4873635 he has time to shoot time to stop the ball and time to play a short or a long pass
4873636 his character is different and important to us because with him other players can grow
4873637 if he is fouled we have a referee to say so but his technical control is fantastic deco can play in any league in the world
4873638 he is my only signing at the moment when they signed a contract with me i told them i want one player deco
4873639 actually i would like one more player but i will not say his name i said if they wanted to change things they needed this player and they tried
4873640 kaka has a contract with milan for five years if you ask milan if they want to sell any players there is only one they would not sell and thats kaka
4873641 technically and i wont say their names two or three players impressed me
4873642 they were better than i thought they would be i changed my ideas about them
4873643 and off the field two or three players who i thought would maybe be not polite and i would have a problem with them proved they were different they had respect and i am satisfied with them
4873644 when you watch games from the outside there are some situations where it seems players arent showing any respect but when you start to work with them you get to know their character and personalities
4873645 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future but these regions are a part of georgia
4873646 i think its very much worthwhile to have given russia that chance
4873647 now i think the behavior recently suggests that perhaps russia has not taken that route or that they would like to have it both ways that is that you behave in a 1968 way toward your neighbors by invading them and at the same time you continue to integrate into the political and diplomatic and economic and security structures of the international community and i think the fact is you cant have it both ways
4873648 yeah im fine there is just a lot of stuff on my mind
4873649 oh yeah he is definitely boyfriend material besides did you see how cute he is

4873669 this idea of being covered in the dust of your rabbi came from something everybody had seen a rabbi would come to town and right behind him would be this group of students doing their best to keep up with the rabbi as he went about teaching his yoke from one place to another by the end of a day of walking in the dirt directly behind their rabbi the students would have the dust from his feet all over them and that was a good thing

4873685 our associate medical director dr simon elsdon has informed me that following our suspension dr murthy was given an interim suspension for 18 months by the gmc
4873686 we are currently awaiting clarification from the national clinical assessment service and the gmc regarding which of them will be undertaking a full assessment of the doctor i had expected their decision by now and as soon as i receive it i will inform you
4873687 my husband started the complaint and on his death i vowed to carry it on both for him and the children even though we know nothing will bring him back after all a life has been wasted here i am pleased the suspension has been extended so that the issue can be looked into fully
4873688 the current suspension set by the pct was for the maximum allowed suspension period available to pcts of six months
4873689 in line with national guidelines the pct reviewed the suspension after three months and applied for an extension from the family health services appeal authority to match the 18 month suspension set by the gmc in march arrangements have been made by the practice for locum cover
4873690 in this world of sin and sorrow there is always something to be thankful for as for me i rejoice that i am not a republican
4873691 ive seen johnsons teams at navy and i think there are good days ahead here
4873692 a work in progress by a life in progress is the third play ive written and in it i really wanted to talk about different things such as getting older
4873693 after edinburgh im going back to new york to do the celebrity apprentice the donald trump show with my daughter
4873694 im still enjoying life as much as i did the showbiz life is great everybody wants it everybody enjoys it theres no way im slowing down
4873695 i just do what ive got to do whatever happens in your life youve just got to keep yourself in the day and let it take care of itself
4873696 i came to do surviving spike after an agent passed me a script when i was sitting round a table at a social evening ive often done things not knowing if they would work out and then ive just added my stuff to it and it has
4873697 i am also a fan of spike which helps i interviewed him once on barrymore and he said to me youre off your chump i said thats rich coming from you
4873698 the play encompasses spikes depression as well so there are parallels with my life i suppose theres this misconception that comedians walk around smiling all the time so when youre not doing it theres just loss unless you keep yourself busy and then get that manic side of it when youre performing you get this flatness i get it sometimes i dont know where it comes from
4873699 i had actually retired for about the tenth time in my life
4873700 i have played the festival before but in the 1950s i was a dancer for a dance troupe and then i did it again a couple of years later
4873701 i think doing the festival might be good for ones career i do lead a different life living in america now but when i play here i can feel something inside me saying mmm maybe i should do this
4873702 i think a lot of people thought i was dead
4873703 its true that edinburgh is very good for your career the entire press depends on edinburgh but its absolutely pot luck as to what they see here theyre either tipped off by someone they know or just follow the course and really like it if theyre surprised by something new
4873704 i actually started my career at edinburgh in 1973 in a play called the thrie estates
4873705 its great as people are in a real holiday mode and they are all here to indulge in their filthy passion for theatre which is lovely ive found my audience to be very lovely and willing to be moved which is great
4873706 playing edinburgh has been great for my career to be honest initially i never dreamed of doing it as i didnt come up through the ranks of the art circuit but i was convinced to do it by someone i knew
4873707 because of the quick turn around you get to see your audience and i saw these people who had wonderful tattoos and piercings and looked liked they had come to see an original hazel oconnor show
4873708 part of my show is a kind of revenge in a comedy style aimed at the bastards that signed me to their record company i had real problems with them a few years ago
4873709 last year i did grumpy old women and my director for that show just asked me one day whether id thought of doing a one woman show
4873710 i know how hard william worked to achieve these excellent results and i am very proud that he has done so well
4873711 we are pleased for prince william as we are for all successful applicants to the university of st andrews and look forward to welcoming him to our community next year
4873712 indeed i did have a relationship with ms lewinsky that was not appropriate in fact it was wrong
4873713 i misled people including my wife i deeply regret that
4873714 this matter is between me the two people i love most my wife and my daughter and our god
4873715 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy
4873716 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun
4873717 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
4873718 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
4873719 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
4873720 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
4873721 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
4873722 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
4873723 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
4873724 new book out and making the move to open access
4873725 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
4873726 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
4873727 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
4873728 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
4873729 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
4873730 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future
4873731 they are characteristics of the spirit mood language and process of science they are operative wherever evidence of social change can be found
4873732 a new kind of person one who is an actively inquiring flexible creative innovative tolerant liberal personality who can face uncertainty and ambiguity without disorientation who can formulate viable new meanings to meet changes in the environment which threaten individual and mutual survival
4873733 i have never heard of what youre talking about i will put my hand on a bible
4873734 of course by all accounts the divorce was completely amicable after john and carol mccains divorce there was apparently some confusion about belongings that were roberta mccains but we understand the court papers were unintentionally filed and the matter never went further in the legal system it went nowhere and was of no consequence
4873735 had no knowledge of the suit he did not authorize the suit or participate in its filing
4873736 you can be sure that i talked to and got the permission of any client who is listed as a plaintiff
4873737 i dont think it took more than 15 minutes of his time
4873738 the fact that they dont remember it doesnt bother me
4873739 based on a candidates support or opposition to an issue that impacts people with disabilities
4873740 it would require asking very sensitive questions in a survey which would lead respondents to hang up
4873741 i know many of you are wondering who will replace me and whether someone big enough can fill this gaping hole
4873742 well you know what they say about guys with big feet right
4873743 the good day of el negro a dog with lots of luck
4873744 this year has been phenomenal for road construction activities with the lack of rain and the excellent weather weve had
4873745 unlike farmers we are very fortunate we havent had rain we have been able to stay on schedule
4873746 could scarcely empty a scuttle of ashes so handless was the poor creature
4873747 to sit back hoping that someday some way someone will make things right is to go on feeding the crocodile hoping he will eat you last but eat you he will
4873748 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
4873749 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety

4873756 the pattern that we see on the ground is unmistakable
4873757 systematic destruction of our military infrastructure and a seemingly random but no less painful degradation of our civilian infrastructure
4873758 they didnt manage to destroy the country to destroy the government to realize their wishes and dreams

4873762 our job at antiwar com is to examine the candidates positions through the lens of anti interventionism subjecting them to the most thorough scrutiny yes we have our opinions but our institutional role is primarily informative we dont endorse candidates we just seek to help our readers answer the most important question of the day will we be a global empire or a free people again alas no candidate will be our salvation there is no messiah on the ballot who will lead us directly to the promised land of peace and nonintervention but this particular election is nonetheless important and its essential for an independent principled organization to hold the candidates feet to the fire that organization is antiwar com
4873763 it is not sexism we really didnt think we need to hold her feet to the fire she is pretty perfect on foreign policy

4873767 nearly all of the rhetoric used by moscow to justify its actions in the war with georgia is derived from western historical thinking and practice only put
4873768 at the end of the day hes going to take heat no matter what
4873769 there was a consensus that it was time for him to get out there
4873770 i think the governor with all the problems going on out there maybe is happiest when hes in the ring throwing those punches
4873771 i think he sat back and tried other ways hes getting other advice and then he says im only happy when im fighting
4873772 if the speaker thinks this kid is going away that hes maybe losing the fight then the speaker is sadly mistaken
4873773 well i know what i was feeling but what was i thinking

4873785 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4873786 its really a miracle the mother had taken no stimulants during ovulation
4873787 from being about what they do to what they mean
4873788 losing the way of life men rely on goodness losing goodness they rely on laws
4873789 finding goodness men rely less on laws finding the way of life they get beyond goodness and judgments of right and wrong and doing the right thing happens because it just seems to make sense
4873790 if oreilly is right and i think he is the future of software lies somewhere in a yet to be explored synergy between the clashing cultures of the freeware and commercial worlds this pioneering experiment with perl creates a whole new model and will go far toward creating that future
4873791 whatever you do to the least of my brothers you do to me
4873792 its real easy to see that every computer in the worlds a macintosh
4873793 there was a time when windows wasnt windows they had microsoft dos and dos was lines you had to type and the funny thing is when they switched over windows 95 windows 98 now theyve got a macintosh
4873794 what i had always wanted was to combine the reliability and beauty of unix with the user interface genius that was xerox
4873795 i would have taken it sooner of course but with the alternative being using windows the os equivalent of junk food i am sure glad that i have the choice of mac i recommend it for all human beings and other creatures as well
4873796 my hero steve jobs figured out how to bring xeroxs ground breaking bit mapped windows mouse icon laser printing hard disk ethernet technology to market hitting the right price points and with style thank god for steve jobs
4873797 the mac inaugurated a fundamental change in the way we use personal computers and popularized and improved on the gui paradigm
4873798 windows awkward though it be to use further propagated ideas first seen on the mac some of which were available still earlier at xerox
4873799 the ease of use that the mac introduced made it possible for millions of people to use the next and more important development a multitude of applications and then most important of all came the internet and the web the use of computers as computers that is as user programmable devices has almost disappeared they have become to use my own coinage information appliances
4873800 i remember vividly firing up macpaint discovering fatbits and spending the next several hours lost in the world of pixels
4873801 if we consider the cultural dimension rather than the economic arena the macs impact was enormous
4873802 the macintosh was different from most of the computers that preceded it in that its builders wanted to imbue their machine with a personality and a sense of style
4873803 the macs impact on personal computing was to create a standard for others to emulate the only time that windows ever remotely came close to edging past the mac was when windows 95 introduced true preemptive multitasking but except for that one time windows has always aspired to be mac like without microsoft ever really understanding what that even means
4873804 apple has been able to reinvent itself because it has what is at bottom an aesthetic vision rather than one that is solely based on profit and loss
4873805 stopped advertising products for what they were or for what they could do and began advertising them for what they meant
4873806 i believe that this same transformation is now happening in the computer industry apple was far ahead of its time in recognizing this dynamic and the marketplace is now entering the period during which their strategy is going to be widely emulated
4873807 apple started this process with the famous 1984 ad and has continued right through its think different theme but above all with a consistent set of design innovations in its products innovations that are aimed at the self image of the consumer that again quoting dave hickey
4873808 information doesnt want to be free information wants to be valuable
4873809 small is the new big but only when the person running the small thinks big
4873810 what i learned about myself while leading a team across a bridge blindfolded
4873811 how do we find the soul of what god is already doing yesterday and today
4873812 otherwise dont do much logging because it will hurt application performance sometimes drastically
4873813 yes im still running even though i havent done anything else lately
4873814 oh that wasnt me that was the 9 year old she out shoots me all the time
4873815 look you stupid creature you have all his to eat why did you eat mothers flowers they dont even taste good i bet how did you get your rope all tangled round your neck please please you foolish beast keep out out of trouble look at that olive tree you know youre not supposed to even like olive leaves i cant take my eye off you for ten minutes
4873816 were really at the stage where the net is the center of everything
4873817 the rules are different we have a new shift in power
4873818 i like to think that even if we make some really bad choices and go down some bad paths well eventually emerge from it
4873819 theres a wonderful phrase in a different context from wallace stevens talking about a metaphysical view of reality versus the information
4873820 beneath every no lays a passion for yes that had never been broken
4873821 beneath every no lays a yes that had never been broken to me theres this wonderful spirit you know i believe people are fundamentally good and want to find things that make life better for themselves there are social dynamics for people that work and there are ones that are pathological but beneath every no lays a yes that had never been broken i put my life faith in that
4873822 small is the new big but only when the person running the small thinks big
4873823 small is the new big but only when the person running the small thinks big
4873824 the values in the cu movement are absolutely right on but i dont think youve translated them into something members understand
4873825 financial institutions seem to be under a collective dark cloud lately at uw credit union things are different for more than 75 years weve been committed to doing the right thing for our members its our guiding business philosophy to always act in the best interest of our members and we practice it every day
4873826 awareness of the profound political and legal dimensions of web 2 0
4873827 apple is like moses showing the way to the promised land but they dont actually go there
4873828 there will be companies that get lazy because they think theyve got it all sewn up
4873829 its that data mobility zone that actually creates a lot of the free flow ideas on the net
4873830 oh i created that review and i want to be able to export it to barnes amp noble as well
4873831 in some ways were re defining what fair use means
4873832 i believe that data lock in of various kinds is going to be one of the key tools of business advantage in the internet era
4873833 is seldom or never just an increment to what is already known its assimilation requires the reconstruction of prior theory and the re evaluation of prior fact an intrinsically revolutionary process that is seldom completed by a single man and never overnight
4873834 im an inventor i became interested in long term trends because an invention has to make sense in the world in which it is finished not the world in which it is started
4873835 my goal is to shrink the size of the operating system market
4873836 become speed to market and the ability responsively and conveniently to give customers exactly what they need when they need it
4873837 i couldnt do what i did with linux for windows even if i had the source code the architecture just wouldnt support it
4873838 we have feeds from thousands of sources each with its own format we do massive amounts of feed processing to clean this stuff up or to find out where to put it on yahoo
4873839 social contract and an invitation to join the network of those who adhere to it
4873840 the best way to predict the future is to invent it
4873841 the age of access the new culture of hypercapitalism where all of life is a paid for experience
4873842 you have to be stupid to believe in santa claus
4873843 i dont know if there is a santa claus or not but i do know you sure can hit for a girl
4873844 you sure are a stupid kid just like roger said no there is not a santa claus mom and dad buys our presents and puts them under the tree after we go to bed but this year there aint gonna be any presents because dad got laid off from his job and they dont have any money to be spending on christmas presents and now you have just made mom feel even worse about it you really are stupid
4873845 yes cricket there is a santa claus but santa isnt a man in a red suit that comes down chimneys with a sack full of toys that part about santa is made up like little red riding hood or the three little pigs santa claus is the spirit of giving that lives in everyones heart sometimes that spirit of giving can only give us presents that we need not just what we want it is because santa lives in my heart that i made you this ragdoll your mom and dad have the spirit of santa in their heart too but sometimes they dont have the money to buy all of you kids the presents their heart wants them to give you so whatever santa leaves for you under the tree tonight just know that it comes from the heart and you shouldnt be hitting other kids because they tease you did hitting that boy make him believe what you believed
4873846 no of course it didnt hitting someone is never the answer to a problem sometimes we just disagree with what other people believe and it is ok to disagree when we disagree with someone we need to use the spirit of understanding that also lives in our heart instead of hitting someone when we disagree with them we need to understand they have a right to believe what they want to believe and we have the right to believe what we want to believe
4873847 act like youve been to the end zone before son
4873848 this week a defence forensic anthropologist an archaeologist and several army historians will conduct a full archaeological dig in the location where private fisher is believed to have fallen
4873849 we are hopeful of providing private fishers family with some long awaited answers and ask on their behalf that the media respect their privacy at this sensitive time
4873850 why didnt you speak up and say look even though its not my call we are about to implement the largest recall in the history of the western world unlawfully because we are going to deny the company its statutory requirement to natural justice why didnt you say that
4873851 you werent prepared to recall this product back then but that was the reason you were going to call the other 6000 products back in 2003

4873877 official legislative documents released this week show that obama in fact presided over a committee hearing where
4873878 there are major differences in state and federal bills including the fact that the federal bill included a neutrality clause
4873879 the obama campaign thinks if they continue to repeat their flimsy story about barack obamas opposition to the common sense born alive infant protection act that their thin explanation will become true the reality is that actual legislative records directly contradict their story
4873880 heres the truth barack obama killed the commonsense born alive infant protection act in the illinois senate and his campaign continues its game of hide and seek thats because his position is heartless there is no baby at any stage even born accidentally that he finds worth protecting where is his heart for the downtrodden when it comes to the most vulnerable human beings it is no wonder he cannot admit to the truth of his leadership as a state senator
4873881 says that they are really concerned about americans finding out the truth about obamas record

4873886 podemos ver en la vida de allende una coherencia en la manera de entender la democracia y los proyectos y luchas pol ticas y desde esa perspectiva entronar un pensamiento y una lucha social por eso l se defini como un luchador social y vivi la democracia como una articulaci n pol tica

4874008 no one knows when that day or hour will come even the angels in heaven and the son dont know only the father knows
4874009 for this we say to you by the word of the lord that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the lord will by no means precede those who are asleep for the lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of an archangel and with the trumpet of god and the dead in christ will rise first then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and thus we shall always be with the lord

4874018 i have problems in my life that only you can fix
4874019 ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss in an improper way that ye may consume it upon your lusts
4874020 if any of you lacks wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him but let him ask in faith nothing wavering doubting for he that wavereth doubts is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the lord
4874021 what do you want me to do with it while im right here

4874033 that was really hard on her balancing her work and the responsibilities around the family that i did take care of traditionally and i just didnt have the energy or the time to do anymore was incredibly hard
4874034 she wont let him go and he wont let her go
4874035 this has been a whole different story the whole way along
4874036 today is more satisfaction for having a good piece race and winning a medal rather than atoning for past losses
4874037 hes had some ups and downs lots of exciting times
4874038 certainly athens was devastating for him so to have today happen just makes amends for all of that
4874039 he believed in his heart i would be the next derek porter and win an olympic gold medal in the singles
4874040 and i tried to explain to him that that just wasnt going to happen for me but that it might happen in another boat class im sure he was here today

4874074 when i was healthy i pitched well when i wasnt i didnt that makes it harder to say i cant do it anymore
4874075 if they dont want me to come back it really doesnt matter

4874083 i see here that you were a brownie troop leader very good very good indeed how do you think your experience as a brownie leader will help you when the bus shows up at school for a field trip you forgot to cancel how does this kind of leadership help the school secretary who set the trip up and who is in charge of all the money you never gave her what kind of food can you leave on her desk to make her understand how truly sorry you are
4874084 of course you are a proud american sir when you travel how do you present yourself to others would you say you were the camera wearing map reading backpack lugging loud speaking version of an american or would you say you represented the quiet thoughtful still water running deep kind of american who speaks or hears no evil who walks everywhere because they cant figure the money out and who keeps ordering the same food all the time because its the only one you know what plan do you have to convince the rest of the world they should be like us or at least put written stuff in english
4874085 excuse me would you happen to know a more efficient way of filtering my e mail
4874086 what i wished someone had told me when i was in high school
4874087 you are correct in identifying the shrinking of humanitarian space and the problems of confusions between the military and humanitarian purposes of foreigners who are here
4874088 the international rescue committee is firmly committed to protecting humanitarian space and distinguishing humanitarian workers from any military employees
4874089 what passes for optimism is most often the effect of an intellectual error
4874090 we feel that nepal has found its hero for any epoch changing society we need a hero
4874091 after europes capitalist revolution napoleon came along to institutionalise socialism in russia lenin appeared
4874092 in nepal to institutionalise the federal democratic republic after 10 years of peoples war and mass popular movement prachanda is here
4874093 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal under the leadership of prachanda the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4874094 were in talks with the parties in our alliance and hope to form a government in the next few days
4874095 the integration of the peoples liberation army into the nepal army will see lots of arguments and counter arguments the way they deal with the army is very crucial
4874096 the maoists will try to bring in populist and radical economic reforms but financially they will have lots of constraints
4874097 he is a communist hardliner but now he has a responsibility to meet the standards of democratic principles
4874098 this is an acid test for him to prove his commitment to democracy
4874099 once again it turns out that the real decisions in this organization are being made between berlin and paris
4874100 saying that the union will have a common policy toward russia is laughable
4874101 historical experience but also from the interests of corporations that think they will make a lot of money in russia
4874102 weve all talked about it and laughed about it and in some cases cried about it and were all starting to relax now

4874105 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still

4874107 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4874108 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect
4874109 hamas is trying through this so called legal proceeding to legitimize its human rights violations and assaults on the freedom of expression
4874110 they are using false claims to justify laying their hands on the property of the residents
4874111 our goal is to empty the hamas and fatah jails of all the detainees

4874288 these snails have an operculum a door that closes the shell
4874289 they can be out of the water for longer than other snails and when fed to fish they are not digested and sometimes come out alive this has a potential to alter the salmon and trout fisheries because they alter the food chain
4874290 in the western u s this species is of special concern largely because of their ability to modify ecosystems
4874291 in our most recent survey we were lucky if we found a few hundred per square meter
4874292 in lake erie they are not very abundant but it is unclear what they are doing 100 feet below the surface
4874293 the first is that any introduction of a nonnative species can cause worse problems than they were expected to cure the second is that these flukes have a multiple host life cycle infecting ducks that are apparently not affected before infecting the snails this might work in the west where the snails are in shallow water but no duck is going to dive 100 feet to get snails
4874294 that means that recreational water users must be very careful moving from one place to another we advise anglers to freeze waders and fishing gear or use formula 409 or something like that to kill the snails
4874295 i have frozen them for 12 hours at a time and about 50 percent of them survive

4874547 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4874553 while much of the central political debate has focussed on other issues such as the governments failure to ease cost of living pressures more and more australians are now questioning why there has been so little progress by the rudd government with broadband despite its overblown promises in opposition in the lead up to the federal election hardly a day passed without mr rudd promising how under labor s plan to spend up to 4 7 billion of taxpayers money broadband in australia would reach mythical levels with the first new services up and running before the end of 2008 and more than eight months after the election communications minister stephen conroy cant even explain what taxpayers will actually get for their 4 7 billion thats billion not million after formally calling for network construction proposals back in april senator conroy has not even been able provide potential bidders with the basic information they need to develop and cost their proposals despite several failed attempts i am receiving reports from around the country of communities asking why they are yet to see any sign of imminent broadband benefits under the rudd government many of these communities would have been beneficiaries of the previous governments opel broadband project which senator conroy cancelled despite having no alternative to it at a time when australians are seeking clarity and explanations as to why labors broadband plan is in tatters senator conroy has conveniently gone to ground and mr rudd doesnt want his name associated with another major embarrassment while senator conroy dithers the private sector has understandably frozen further broadband investment in commercially viable areas of the market depriving consumers of new services today the big problem for labor is it based its broadband promise on an election sound bite with no sound public policy to back it up for senator conroy shifting deadlines and dodging scrutiny will not fix a fundamentally flawed process

4874684 it was a dark and stormy night the rain fell in torrents except at occasional intervals when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets for it is in london that our scene lies rattling along the housetops and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness
4874685 lord lytton was also deeply concerned about the welfare of b c s first nations and sent specific instructions to gov james douglas in that regard
4874686 general amherst was the guy that had blankets inoculated with small pox and had them given to native people as gifts
4874687 when it comes to linking specifically general amherst to the mikmaq we dont have any clear documentation that things like germ warfare were carried out
4874688 lets put it this way in the future i dont think there should ever be anything named after people who committed what can be described as crimes against humanity i dont see why this should be any exception
4874689 hes part of history so is amherst nothing says that you have to idolize them phony history is not in the best interest of anybody
4874690 i know theres some people around that are gonna be difficult to deal with but i think were fighting the good fight and were gonna go with it til the end
4874691 its in no way a name that was selected to glorify or to honour a particular person its a name used by the british to name the fort and its now a historic place name that has been used for the last 250 years
4874692 i think fort amherst is fine i dont really know all the history all i can say is its just been fort amherst for so long
4874693 its been that way for centuries its just part of the local fabric fort amherst has been there as long as i can remember
4874694 it might be a good policy for canada to recognize our people
4874695 but since it was established by the french why not give it the original french name i would be in favour of that
4874696 i guess anyone could potentially ask for a name change we would review it and determine if its appropriate
4874697 to have a place named after general amherst would be like having a city in jerusalem named after adolf hitler its disgusting
4874698 i dont generally comment on people who quote adolf hitler or make comparisons to him
4874699 history does not entrust the care of freedom to the weak or timid
4874700 the best way to destroy an enemy is to make him your friend
4874701 naturally the common people dont want war but after all it is the leaders of a country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in every country
4874702 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american public
4874703 our plan is not an evil plan and we are not trying to terrorize the people who love the badlands
4874704 we need this and we have a legal right to it
4874705 its going to alter the whole feel of the area if this road goes through

4874707 a lot of folks are very supportive of it and would like the benefit of shaving 90 to 100 miles off their commute
4874708 locals are all for it but i wonder how heavy they federal officials will weigh it in a county losing population
4874709 its not like we just threw a dart this is not only the logical location but the only place that is feasible because of terrain
4874710 otherwise wed have to plow through 6 miles of untouched badlands
4874711 we see it as the cradle of conservation where the concept of conservation started in this country
4874712 everyone should try to see all the oscar winners from their lifetime

4874718 a fired bank executive who became the first person to win protection under a federal law that shields whistle blowers only to see his victory overturned suffered another setback in a federal appeals court tuesday a three judge panel of the 4th u s circuit court of appeals did not reinstate david welch to his job ruling that he failed to explain how his employers shoddy accounting practices could be considered a violation of federal law since sarbanes oxley was signed into law more that 1 000 self professed whistle blowers have come forward and most have seen their cases rejected welch was the first to win his case before an administrative law judge but that decision was reversed in june 2007 by the department of labors dol administrative review board

4875187 i grew up in the roswell area i was almost 17 and senior in high school when it happened family members were ranchers and cattle people we knew all the ranchers and towns people in the area including where the ufo impacted in spite of official denials and threats about talking the local lore told the story
4875188 after my space flight and being a local boy people involved not only the locals trusted me with their stories because they were getting older and wanted the truth out but were afraid to say it publicly so considered me a trustworthy source to carry their story onward been telling it all that way if anyone bothered to ask my opinion since the pentagon incident 11 years ago only now suddenly it got international media attention
4875189 i did take my story to the pentagon not nasa but the pentagon and asked for a meeting with the intelligence committee of the joint chiefs of staff and got it and told them my story and what i know and eventually had that confirmed by the admiral that i spoke with that indeed what i was saying was true
4875190 some things are true whether you believe them or not
4875191 why are numbers beautiful its like asking why is proof as
4875192 a great many theorems of mathematics when rst published appear to be surprising thus for example some twenty years ago from 1977 the proof of the existence of on spheres of high dimension was thought to be surprising but it did not occur to anyone to call such a fact beautiful then or now
4875193 it is very difficult to nd an analogous invention in the past to milnors beautiful construction of the different differential structures on the seven dimensional sphere the original proof of milnor was not very constructive but later e briscorn showed that these differential structures can be described in an extremely explicit and beautiful form

4875250 something that i think if we were at a different part of the season in the standings and so forth he would pitch through it but at this point wed like to take the opportunity to just stretch him out a bit
4875251 hopefully get him ready to come back in september and be himself
4875252 its a very big concern because we do want to do a number of things with jamarcus in the passing game
4875253 the more they make plays the more that builds confidence for him and for all of us
4875254 this week will be the longest that they play together theyll play into the second half
4875255 hopefully well get some chemistry going this week with our quarterback and receivers
4875256 theres a couple of balls there that we would have liked him to come up with
4875257 at the end of everything all that matters is how do you perform on game day for him not to make those plays or the first game there was a fade that we throw to him that he didnt go up and get thats discouraging because he was paid an awful lot of money paid like one of the top five receivers in the nfl we need him to make those plays
4875258 its something johnnie did a lot last year in practices and is why we werent able to trust him to play that much in games
4875259 hopefully hes going to show us over these next two games that that isnt going to be an issue
4875260 he played the best of all our receivers last night including the front line guys and its good to see because he did not play well in the first game on offense or on special teams
4875261 we have got to get there first to see how everything is
4875262 theres no problem as long as our resting and eating times are respected
4875263 but we could do with fewer volunteers there are too many of them around the team
4875264 the pitch didnt help at all the stadium is fantastic but the most important thing is the pitch
4875265 weve got a good group of guys working there weve got some tough decisions to make at that position not only in terms of who makes the team but in how we sort it out those are good problems to have
4875266 we know we have to uphold the tradition around here of all these great linebackers that have come through here
4875267 weve got to hold up our end of the bargain
4875268 i think athletically they have a chance to be good steeler linebackers
4875269 we like what we have seen from those young men

4875308 the evil that men do lives after them in lyttons case in 27 novels whose perfervid turgidity i intend to expose denude and generally make visible
4875309 if you want to scare me youre going to have to work a little harder than that
4875310 i very strongly feel that to be the first person to come up with a cliche is genius

4875314 some people credit him with creating the historical novel as we know it
4875315 i think he was just very melodramatic and reached too hard for effects i think he was very pretentious he was convinced he was a genius
4875316 it was a dark and stormy night the rain fell in torrents except at occasional intervals when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets for it is in london that our scene lies rattling along the housetops and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness
4875317 lord lytton was also deeply concerned about the welfare of b c s first nations and sent specific instructions to gov james douglas in that regard

4875464 i think he was just very melodramatic and reached too hard for effects i think he was very pretentious he was convinced he was a genius

4875487 i struggled coming down the back nine but pulled it out in the end when it mattered
4875488 i thought after the first few holes it was going to be a great round but then a few missed putts and it was tough it was a battle out there today im so happy to win but wish i could have played a little better

4875490 i played a consistent round with no bogeys and that is definitely what i wanted to do i would have liked for a couple of more putts to drop and i left a couple short too
4875491 this is the biggest tournament that i have ever won frasier said
4875492 it is especially good because i was in the lead all four days i am usually coming from behind when i win so it is nice to win when i have been in front of everyone else
4875493 i was telling myself to be patient all day and the putts finally started dropping and i extended the lead said frasier
4875494 i came here to get into the junior ryder cup winning the junior pga championship was a huge bonus

4875520 so many things are unknown with the way food is produced that it feels really good to keep control of it
4875521 it fits with what weve seen historically from the 1970s and even before then when people tighten their belts they focus a little bit less on convenience items and convenience foods and focus a little bit more on staying home and making their own whether youre talking about food or fun
4875522 the straw that broke the camels back was the economy
4875523 but the underlying reason is healthier food were tired of food that has tons of sodium preservatives and all the nasty stuff they put in food that you dont have to be eating
4875524 what i hear is the words the economy and weve started growing a garden because we dont know whats going to happen to the economy in the future

4875550 this is most tournament of my life before i came up here i talked to my dad and he told me just go in there and do everything you can and that im in his heart and i feel like i let him down
4875551 i went in there and gave it my all and i think i should have won this fight it was definitely an experience im facing the top guys in the world the best guys in the world and i want to give a big thanks to god because if it wasnt for him i wouldnt be in this position today
4875552 we had a game plan going into the bout we wanted him to box but the main thing we wanted him to do was to get up early and get up first
4875553 we wanted him to engage early we knew he had faster hands and more power we wanted him to engage the guy and get up by three and make the guy have to come to him
4875554 i think i should have won the 8 7 draw in the first two rounds i was just trying to keep it close that way in the last round i will be up in that third round i came out firing i thought i was maybe up by two but they said they had it tied up in that last round i went in there hands up i knew i leaned in with the straight left and he caught me with the straight hook i give him that i think i got him with two more punches and it should have been an 8 7 win for me
4875555 he his father said he was going to be awake and he told me to call him as soon as im done hes having a lot of prayers around me hes my motivation for everything he plays a big role he and my coach dennis rodarte and hector beltran all three of them are in my heart i dont think i could have done anything better out there
4875556 dennis just told me to go out there have fun and be the latin legend that i am i went in there i had fun i didnt get tired in there i went in there and did what i had to do
4875557 they were trying to tell me to go at him go at him go at him im not that fighter to just go out there and throw punches if i do that im going to get caught with shots and i want to go out there play it smart and keep my hands up i wanted to make the fight close i went in there the last round i know i should have the last round thats the way the judges see it and you cant overrule the judges
4875558 thats the way my coach always taught me to do everything off the jab throw the jab make him throw and counter right back with the 2 3 2 like i said i went in there i had my coach and everybody in my heart when they see this fight i know they will think i should have won this fight i have no doubt that i shouldnt have lost this fight
4875559 thats a big word its over i cant consider anything being over im going to go back home with my family my little brother and sister and especially my dad are there i dont know how im going to deal with talking to him yet i know he was really nervous before when i talked to him i know i could have medaled i know i could have gotten in the ring with zou and beat him but if i cant beat the opponent in front of me
4875560 i love you dad i love you dennis and i love you hector
4875561 my teammates said that they werent playing it fair a lot of world champions have been getting beat in this tournament and thats a big disappointment to a lot of people i wanted to be the disappointment to zou shiming i went in there and gave it my all i did what i had to do and i guess thats what the judges saw
4875562 dan told me that i had to throw i felt like i was up and they told me i was down so i went in there with my hands up and obviously he was running i went there and i couldnt get that last point
4875563 i just want to go back to my family right now
4875564 he started playing the waiting game from the beginning which we didnt understand we were yelling to him in between rounds we asked him several things to engage this guy he has faster hands and to get his hands up hed throw half a punch and pull straight back the main thing was the when he did throw a punch he was pulling back with his hands down and those were the things that caused him problems
4875565 hes actually a very aggressive boxer until tonight one of the things that has always helped luis is his aggression he didnt exhibit that tonight he decided to stand back and wait and it cost him hes always been an aggressive fighter and thats how he has won in the past
4875566 i saw several things and i called back to my technical advisor and asked what he saw number one most of those jabs werent landing and so they didnt give him credit for it i did see him throw a punch in the third round catch the guy squarely and the other guy got a point it is just a carryover of whats been happening with the officiating lack of execution on the part of our boxers particularly tonight cost him the bout
4875567 when guys start feeling like they are going to get robbed anyway they revert to a safe way of boxing and to wait seems safe even though they might have the better hand speed and more power to them its safer to wait because that way they cant get hit

4875574 the biggest issue with umd was the lack of creating for a targeted demographic when we first launched it was a difficult sale i dont think its a big stretch to say that a 16 year old doesnt have a lot of discretionary income we were offering umds that were more expensive than dvds at the time and we want content that is in line with what the demo is asking for action and comedy not romantic dramas

4875598 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4875599 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4875600 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4875601 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
4875602 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
4875603 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4875604 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
4875605 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
4875606 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
4875607 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4875608 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4875609 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4875610 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
4875611 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
4875612 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
4875613 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
4875614 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
4875615 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
4875616 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
4875617 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
4875618 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
4875619 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
4875620 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
4875621 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
4875622 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
4875623 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
4875624 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4875625 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
4875626 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
4875627 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4875628 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4875629 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
4875630 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
4875631 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
4875632 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
4875633 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
4875634 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
4875635 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4875636 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
4875637 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4875638 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4875639 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4875640 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4875641 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4875642 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4875643 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4875644 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4875645 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4875646 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4875647 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4875648 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4875649 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4875650 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4875651 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4875652 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4875653 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4875654 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4875655 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4875656 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4875657 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4875658 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4875659 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4875660 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4875661 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4875662 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4875663 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4875664 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente

4875667 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad

4875680 every people must answer morally for all of its past including that past which is shameful answer by what means by attempting to comprehend how could such a thing have been allowed where in all this is our error and could it happen again it is in that spirit specifically that it would behoove the jewish people to answer both for the revolutionary cutthroats and the ranks willing to serve them not to answer before other peoples but to oneself to ones consciousness and before god just as we russians must answer for the pogroms for those merciless arsonist peasants for those crazed revolutionary soldiers for those savage sailors

4875687 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and his values
4875688 its crazy this man rangel controls tax policy in the united states rangel is chairman of ways and means hes a lot bigger than just a regular member of congress he deserves more respect than this
4875689 basically they have told us they cant help us that there are too many obama supporters ahead of charlie on the line
4875690 my loyalty is to the democrats winning barack obama is going to have a serious problem getting elected for good reason
4875691 the party needs to face the fact that without hillary clinton on the ticket the democrats will probably lose

4875697 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4875698 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4875699 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

4875701 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4875702 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4875703 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4875704 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4875705 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4875706 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4875707 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4875708 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4875709 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4875710 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4875711 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4875712 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4875713 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4875714 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4875715 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4875716 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4875717 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4875718 its tough to play after you shoot 61 and i thought i played good
4875719 unless you get off to a really hot start you feel like youre behind the eight ball
4875720 im making a lot more putts than i did the first day
4875721 all i can do is play the best i can and try to shoot a low score ill focus on being consistent hitting fairways and greens
4875722 im out of contention to win now but i still feel i can shoot in the 60s out here and that would be a great way to finish to get back into red numbers
4875723 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4875724 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4875725 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4875726 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4875727 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4875728 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4875729 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4875730 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4875731 eu dei sorte que o time se superou eu e o moraci santanna preparador f sico tivemos pouco tempo em termos de trabalho mas esse grupo vai crescer muito e gostei de lidar com eles um pessoal limpo um pessoal do bem um exemplo de grupo de jogadores de futebol

4875740 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4875741 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4875742 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4875743 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4875744 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4875745 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4875746 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4875747 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4875748 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4875749 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4875750 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4875751 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4875752 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4875753 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4875754 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4875755 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4875756 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4875757 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4875758 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4875759 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4875760 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4875761 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

4875765 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4875766 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4875767 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4875768 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4875769 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4875770 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4875771 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4875772 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4875773 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4875774 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

4875859 do dogs have souls maybe not in the sense we reserve for ourselves but in other sense memory thats where they go and its good enough for them i thought of some other dogs ive known and how its necessary to recollect them from time to time and thank them for the honor of holding their ghosts until you relinquish your own
4875860 i know of no reason why i should not look for the animals to rise again in the same sense in which i hope myself to rise again which is to reappear clothed with another and better form of life than before
4875861 love is the one bond of the universe the heart of god the life of his children if animals can be loved they are lovable if they can love they are yet more plainly lovable love is eternal how then should its object perish
4875862 is not our love to the animals a precious variety of love

4875966 i havent won any international races before but we knew beforehand we can do it
4875967 we were obviously behind but i started to think we might do it when i looked across to the aussies with 100m to go
4875968 i cant believe how happy i am no one can ever take that away from me but ive got no energy left
4875969 our coach jurgen grobler kept telling us no one could beat us but sometimes it was hard to believe him
4875970 i always thought id get back into the boat for beijing
4875971 we didnt have much time to prepare but weve done it now all i want to do is chill out
4875972 the president issued an order to the relevant authorities to start the adoption of extra security measures envisaged in the six point plan
4875973 as these security measures are implemented the withdrawal of forces sent to carry out this reinforcement operation will be carried out
4875974 a major issue is russias contention that the region of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be part of georgias future
4875975 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so theres no room for debate on this matter
4875976 i am telling you with all responsibility that this could not have happened
4875977 when we were involved in combat actions as part of the peacekeeping operation bridges were our targets indeed but now when there is peace why should we blow up bridges it is us who would have to restore them we are working hard there
4875978 our units are on the outskirts of gori now where large arsenals of georgian weapons including 15 tanks have been discovered

4876007 mama this is the first time i have been pain free this medicine just might really help me
4876008 this is a wonderful medicine used appropriately but an unforgiving medicine used inappropriately
4876009 many legitimate patients following the direction of the doctor have run into trouble with methadone including death
4876010 methadone is an extremely difficult drug to use even for specialists people were using it rather blithely for several years
4876011 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
4876012 this could unequivocally cause death in patients who have not recently been using narcotics
4876013 we would have no reason to suspect that the dosing regimen
4876014 as soon as we became aware of deaths due to misprescribing for pain patients we began the process of instituting label changes
4876015 i dont think a drug that requires such a level of sophistication to use is what id call cheap because of the risks
4876016 given the medicines he was on his brain forgot to tell his heart to beat and his lungs to pump
4876017 i never had any idea of the risk nor did my husband
4876018 we know that a significant share of the methadone deaths involve doctors making well intended prescriptions
4876019 methadone can be important for patients when other drugs dont work
4876020 but unless the doctor has the training and resources to manage the patient properly hes going to get in trouble at a rate thats unacceptable

4876037 when i took that last stroke i thought i lost the race there but it turns out that was the difference
4876038 all right stern you can have tanktown vs cowtown or you can have boston vs la
4876039 by hosting these poland is making itself a target this is 100 per cent certain it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority
4876040 the deployment of new missile defence facilities in europe is aimed against the russian federation
4876041 the cold war is over bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4876042 if there was an olympic medal awarded for synchronised moaning killies jefferies and brown would be gold medallists
4876043 some things just never change in football the away team denied a penalty then the home team getting one in the closing stages to ensure victory at ibrox
4876044 sammons up in the air but hes missed it the one that got away again
4876045 this is uncharacteristic of walter smith very rarely does he throw on two attacking players when were in the lead i wonder if this is the start of something new at ibrox
4876046 if killie can snatch a victory in paisley today that could set up a top of the table clash with hamilton next saturday feel free to end the league competition now
4876047 first of all lol the time stamp and secondly he has quite an appropriate name doesnt he bolt
4876048 im getting a bit worried about motherwells lack of depth in the squad we really dont have enough cover for any area i know mcghee wants quality but i fear he may be leaving us a little short for the first part of the season
4876049 its always good to watch jim jefferies and billy brown having a go at the fourth official
4876050 david falkirk are going to come back and win at easter road you heard it here first
4876051 rangers are certainly getting nearer the goal but hearts goalkeeper jamie macdonald will be happy with his performance so far
4876052 im stuck at work still its good to have the footy back staying positive it worked last week and going for killie to win 2 1 although i think we will concede the first goal
4876053 in the absence of barry ferguson kevin thomson needs to step up to the plate today
4876054 we need rangers to go out there today and show the fans that they mean business this season a convincing win today
4876055 100 on a hearts win the day fill yer boots
4876056 walters trolley dash if only it was jimmy calderwood the one and only don winton
4876057 we are poor at predicting what will make us happy in the future
4876058 if there hadnt been an elvis there wouldnt have been the beatles
4876059 my advice to the obama people proceed with extreme caution they dont want to get into a discussion of character and background they are opening a door that they will not be able to close they are putting on the table issues and personalities that they do not want to discuss

4876117 it is clear that he and i have two very different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4876118 they were all our first choices everyone said yes which is so rare
4876119 our motto has been get the story right get the facts right tell it honestly
4876120 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4876121 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
4876122 a remarkable indictment of the corruption and cynicism rife among climate scientists

4876126 i have to play my own game and not think too much i have a four shot lead so theres a lot of room to play good
4876127 of course you dont expect anything like that that probably made my day
4876128 im making a lot more putts than i did the first day
4876129 all i can do is play the best i can and try to shoot a low score ill focus on being consistent hitting fairways and greens
4876130 it was such a long day and i had a headache so i just tried to concentrate on every shot
4876131 im out of contention to win now but i still feel i can shoot in the 60s out here and that would be a great way to finish to get back into red numbers

4876153 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
4876154 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
4876155 this gives them an outlet to share and discuss their passion on issues they care about
4876156 there are a lot of people who have a great deal of knowledge about living sustainable and environmental lifestyles within the county
4876157 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
4876158 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
4876159 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work

4876164 saya pikir pertandingan di babak pertama sangat sulit mereka mengontrol pertandingan selama 45 menit tapi tidak mendapat lebih dari satu peluang emas kami sedikit di baah tekanan tetapi semuanya berbeda di babak kedua
4876165 kami berhasil mengendalikannya dan kualitas operan kami menjadi lebih baik kami menguasai permainan dan jauh lebih baik ketika menyerang
4876166 pada akhirnya yang menjadi penentu tetaplah torres kami tahu ia ia bisa mencetak gol seperti itu namun tim secara keseluruhan juga harus tampil baik
4876167 ik sta hier misschien wel op het mooiste plekje in oost gelre

4876169 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
4876170 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
4876171 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
4876172 this will be the first american military installation in the former communist bloc which will also be close to the russian border
4876173 deployment of new missile defence facilities in europe is aimed against the russian federation
4876174 by hosting these weapons poland is making itself a target this is 100 percent
4876175 it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority
4876176 russia should not make an immediate military response by deploying short range iskander missiles or other systems on the polish border
4876177 russia is so compromised in the eyes of the west that if it wants to keep the winter olympics at sochi and sign an agreement with the world trade organisation it will have to show restraint and realism
4876178 in reality this project has no relation to the iranian missile threat but is aimed against russia
4876179 id be remiss if i didnt say hello buddy cianci mayor of providence
4876180 i want you to know i was wearing my rhode island democrats t shirt when i was exercising this morning put that in the paper
4876181 i get amused when i see that stern faced young man from colorado extolling the merits of assault weapons
4876182 i didnt see any donkeys although we heard a weird sound when we first got in here
4876183 they must have you know seen me coming but they all hid somewhere
4876184 i dont care if you have jesus christ in the van
4876185 no i know if i needed to get out id make my way out just as i made my way in you have to see the possibilities
4876186 if my opponent had been there at the moon launch it would have been called a risky rocket scheme
4876187 if hed been there when edison was testing the light bulb it would have been a risky anti candle scheme
4876188 and if hed been there when the internet was invented
4876189 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body

4876201 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
4876202 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
4876203 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4876204 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4876205 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4876206 liberals are more self centered than conservatives conservatives are more generous and charitable than liberals liberals are more envious and less hardworking than conservatives conservatives value truth more than liberals and are less prone to cheating and lying liberals are more angry than conservatives conservatives are actually more knowledgeable than liberals liberals are more dissatisfied and unhappy than conservatives
4876207 held on 260 000 00 bond on charges including cocaine possession attempt to sell cocaine and traffic charges
4876208 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4876209 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al

4876227 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4876228 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4876229 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4876230 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4876231 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4876232 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4876233 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet
4876234 how much stock can you buy with 100 000 answer 100 000s worth but how much realestate can you buy with 100 000 answer 1 000 000
4876235 the conspicuous aura of self congratulation that accompanies any act of eco altruism no matter how trivial or self serving eco smugness can be seen in everything from greenfleet bumper stickers just so everyone knows youre offsetting your automotive emissions to growing your own vegies then quietly letting everyone know about it
4876236 kidney cancer drugs could be produced for about a tenth of their current cost
4876237 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
4876238 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
4876239 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4876240 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4876241 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4876242 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4876243 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4876244 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4876245 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4876246 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4876247 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4876248 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch

4876250 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4876251 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4876252 ive lent my crystal ball to someone so i cant give you the figure
4876253 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4876254 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4876255 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4876256 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4876257 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4876258 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4876259 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4876260 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4876261 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4876262 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4876263 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4876264 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4876265 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4876266 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4876267 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4876268 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4876269 recycling is recycling glass should be included its not about making money its about making difference
4876270 he was once a muslim gt but that he alsoattended catholic school
4876271 senator obama has never been a muslim was not raised as a muslim and is a committed christian
4876272 en defensa de la democracia ni un paso atr s
4876273 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4876274 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4876275 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4876276 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4876277 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4876278 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4876279 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4876280 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4876281 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4876282 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4876283 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4876284 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4876285 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4876286 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4876287 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4876288 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4876289 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4876290 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4876291 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4876292 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4876293 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4876294 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4876295 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all

4876301 most sophisticated taxonomy of musical information ever collected it represents over eight years of analysis by their trained team of musicologists and spans almost a century of music and soon several centuries
4876302 it meets the definitions of plutoid and dwarf planet and if it werent orbiting pluto it would be a dwarf planet
4876303 the idea that charon might qualify to be called a dwarf planet on its own may be considered later
4876304 were not going to court complaining that atk is threatening shuttle safety not by a long shot
4876305 but what we are saying is that as long as were responsible to our customer for ensuring a capable and focused work force to safely fly this system were going to take the actions that we feel are necessary to preserve and protect that ability
4876306 when i went in the room to talk to an elder cyclist mentor i had no thoughts of doping when i came out doping was decided on
4876307 to go to school to be a doctor or lawyer or whatever
4876308 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4876309 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4876310 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4876311 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4876312 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4876313 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4876314 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4876315 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4876316 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4876317 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4876318 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4876319 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4876320 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4876321 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4876322 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4876323 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4876324 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4876325 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4876326 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4876327 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4876328 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4876329 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4876330 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4876331 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4876332 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4876333 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4876334 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4876335 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4876336 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4876337 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4876338 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4876339 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4876340 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4876341 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4876342 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4876343 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4876344 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4876345 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4876346 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4876347 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4876348 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4876349 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4876350 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4876351 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4876352 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4876353 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4876354 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4876355 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4876356 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4876357 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4876358 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4876359 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4876360 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4876361 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4876362 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4876363 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4876364 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4876365 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4876366 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4876367 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4876368 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4876369 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4876370 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4876371 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4876372 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4876373 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4876374 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4876375 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4876376 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4876377 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4876378 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4876379 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4876380 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4876381 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4876382 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4876383 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4876384 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4876385 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4876386 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4876387 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4876388 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4876389 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4876390 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4876391 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4876392 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4876393 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4876394 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4876395 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4876396 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4876397 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4876398 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4876399 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4876400 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4876401 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4876402 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4876403 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4876404 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4876405 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4876406 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4876407 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4876408 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4876409 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4876410 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4876411 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4876412 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4876413 who are open to doing something on the production side
4876414 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4876415 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4876416 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4876417 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4876418 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4876419 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4876420 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4876421 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4876422 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4876423 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4876424 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4876425 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4876426 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4876427 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4876428 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4876429 vim a esta comunidade deixada de lado por todos os governos anteriores durante a campanha eleitoral e fiz uma promessa se triunfasse viria a san pedro e ficaria com seu povo sofrido para fortalecer a esperan a de um futuro melhor trabalharei para que essa regi o deixe de ser isolada e seja incorporada ao processo de desenvolvimento social e econ mico

4876443 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4876444 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4876445 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4876446 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4876447 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4876448 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4876449 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4876450 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4876451 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4876452 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4876453 just so you all know we did set a record
4876454 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4876455 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4876456 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4876457 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4876458 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4876459 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4876460 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4876461 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4876462 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4876463 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4876464 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4876465 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4876466 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4876467 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4876468 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4876469 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4876470 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4876471 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4876472 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4876473 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4876474 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4876475 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4876476 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4876477 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4876478 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4876479 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4876480 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4876481 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4876482 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4876483 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4876484 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4876485 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4876486 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4876487 if i was a buddhist i would totally buy this
4876488 seriously how did i become some kind of tortured mystic
4876489 im going to ascend and throw lightening bolts at you
4876490 newspapers have about a year to get rid of all the people who cant pull their own weight and to redeploy all the smart energetic journalists who can find the great stories and push them out to print web and video some papers still have lots of talent but they must push it to the front so readers can find it and find that they like it
4876491 many people complain that the u s air use rules are vague and that copyright law hasnt really been updated for the digital age how do you think the laws should be changed to help protect copyright holders while also respecting video remixes and fair use or do you think the laws are fine as is
4876492 news media love conflict and when religion and science clash in political arguments they like to stoke the flame
4876493 the press remains an essential national institution in its job of independently probing for facts about wrongdoing or information the government wants to shield from its citizens its watchdog role is never more vital than during a national crisis
4876494 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4876495 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4876496 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4876497 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4876498 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon

4876504 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4876505 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4876506 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4876507 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4876508 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4876509 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4876510 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4876511 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4876512 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
4876513 bob has been pretty influential in the overall sound and to some degree the arrangements on this record like he was on the last record he kind of becomes the sixth member in the studio and that works well because we trust him and he hears things the same way we do
4876514 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4876515 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4876516 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4876517 i didnt say i was powerful i said i was a wizard
4876518 we have been doing this band with various line ups for about 10 years and after making worst band name ever i am happy to go out on a good note and pursue other fun stuff fatherhood golf taste testing
4876519 the essence of innovation is the blending of ideas with the science and practice of engineering nowhere is this process more active than in the area of identification technologies

4876526 estoy muy agradecido a jose luis y su equipo de audi imsa por la amabilidad y el trato recibido estoy seguro que haremos grandes cosas juntos y este trato me motiva para seguir entrenando duro e intentar llegar a lo mas alto
4876527 id like to believe that it will not happen again and he believes that also
4876528 and id like to believe that it wont ever happen again
4876529 you know what its like when you have children and you say get the car home at a certain time or be home before a certain time and they dont theres a certain amount of anger at first but then a lot of its based on disappointment and thats primarily if i had to describe my emotions its that
4876530 hes a big part of this organization in the future but you have to draw the line at some point to make sure all the right things do occur in the years to come
4876531 he can be a catalyst for us during the playoffs and i want him to understand that but we have to work through some moments and issues right now to get to that point and he listened very well and i listened to him and were going to move it along last time is ancient history
4876532 some of it has to be my perception of whats going on
4876533 in every case its on an individual basis because some guys might have leg injuries and i understand that there may be some kind of a situation going on and that theyre not going to be able to look the same and i get that but being that youre healthy theres a certain way i want you to look and thats up to my eyes
4876534 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4876535 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4876536 we didnt go 52 28 because jim leyland called me but he was a big league manager and he took the time to recognize and understand what its like for somebody that is down in the trenches because he had been there
4876537 he didnt teach me about how to bunt or whatever he taught me about managing people
4876538 i think thats why hes the best he and dodgers manager joe torre are the best theres no question in my mind because they know how to manage people thats what i learned from jim leyland
4876539 in this type of environment the cream rises to the top
4876540 get a chance to demonstrate their actual expertise by writing about things that are relevant to the consumer
4876541 we were doing a piece on a handball court in bronx river laughing illegally and a dude came up to bio and asked if he would throw his deceased brother pollo up the first real memorial wall we did was on cypress avenue amp east 141st street in the bronx for a guy named tony who was murdered and then set on fire in his car
4876542 it certainly looks like a j probably wont be here i dont know
4876543 he seems to want to get closer to home just put the numbers together and you can figure that one out real easy hes probably got to do whats best for his family
4876544 id love to have him here but if he wants to go somewhere else you cant do anything about that
4876545 he was probably putting himself in my shoes and answering anything that he would do but im not going to worry about it ive got a month and a half to finish
4876546 no i look at it as im finally living up to my potential and my expectations
4876547 i dont really care about the free agent market and money and things like that im finally healthy and im finally winning some ballgames and helping this team out for the first time in three years thats the way i look at it
4876548 i cant think of one manager in the league who wouldnt like to have his arm its just this year hes getting over the hump i guess when he goes out there hes managed to stay out there probably a little bit longer than he has in the past
4876549 i think we have more depth now than weve ever had
4876550 i think were prepared in any way if he wants to stay hes more than welcome to stay if he doesnt stay then we think weve got enough guys internally that we can bridge the gap a little bit
4876551 i havent made up my mind and i havent talked to my family i havent talked to anyone about it im just concentrating i dont want to be distracted with any of that right now
4876552 this is the david bridie you know but with a bigger sound of edgy guitar whirling keyboards and anthemic vocals alongside his trademark textures pacific percussion beats and lyrics of wry social observation
4876553 no wonder bridie is feeling better this year hes made what might be the best record of his career 24 years after making his debut with not drowning waving
4876554 after 12 years under the social conservatives i see this as a time of possibility an opportunity to move forward rather than be overwhelmed by despair
4876555 a lot of the questions remain the same but the beam of light shone upon them is brighter
4876556 its too easy to get wrapped up in the here and now
4876557 i loved going to work each day it was like this long continuous dinner party
4876558 this sound straddles anything else thats currently happening in music and to me thats important
4876559 in each series ive felt weve nearly got there maybe this time with you guys involved well finally nail it
4876560 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4876561 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4876562 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4876563 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4876564 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4876565 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4876566 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
4876567 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
4876568 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
4876569 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4876570 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4876571 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4876572 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4876573 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4876574 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
4876575 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years

4876577 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4876578 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4876579 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4876580 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4876581 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4876582 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4876583 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that

4876586 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4876587 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4876588 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4876589 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4876590 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4876591 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4876592 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year

4876598 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4876599 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4876600 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise

4876603 women far outnumber men as victims of intimate partner violence and intimate partner violence is deadlier for women what do i base this on try reading the justice departments studies which are conducted impartially and which are based on police reports fbi reports and the national crime victimization survey what does the justice department say about intimate partner violence that women are victims of violence by intimate partners far more often than are men how much more often well according to the justice department which oughta know 85 of intimate violence is committed against women only 5 15 of intimate violence is committed against men and please be sure to notice that that figure includes same sex violence

4876634 the corps made no assertion that other toll road alternatives considered in the draft eis seir were not practicable
4876635 not only misleading but it creates potential misconceptions about the corps ability and willingness to render impartial decisions that are neither arbitrary nor capricious
4876636 it is imperative the record reflect that the corps was not party to unanimous recommendations that led to the tca board of supervisors certifying their final seir either in the manner of time frame they did

4876638 the selected project alternative reflects the consensus reached by the federal transportation and environmental agencies after a six year 20 million federal environmental analysis
4876639 they dont want you at their beach even if it means double the time you spend driving home
4876640 the saddest part of their entire multi million dollar blame it on the surfers and environmentalists pr campaign is that it is entirely financed by public taxpayers dollars in the form of federal loans and gifts to tca what a sick scam the public is financing a project the public is dead set against

4876668 three deployments in i still have days when i want to hide under the bed and cry
4876669 its hard to go away its hard to come back and go away and come back again
4876670 that is happening on a larger scale than in our previous military endeavors theyre just getting their feet wet with some sort of sense of normalcy and then they have to go again
4876671 theres nothing that has prepared many of our families for the length of these deployments
4876672 its hard to communicate to a family member how stressful the environment is not just the risk of injury or death but the austere circumstances the climate the living conditions
4876673 infidelity is huge on both sides a wife is lonely she looks for attention and finds it easier to cheat

4876679 my wife and friends they tell me im not the same person before i came back not as loving
4876680 you really realize how insignificant you are in this world and life moves on whether youre there or not
4876681 the tactics learned as part of military training are often used by those who commit domestic violence
4876682 they have no clue what the rate of domestic violence is they only know whats reported to the system and thats always lower than the actual rate
4876683 im disappointed i know the system is stressed to the umpteenth degree but i do think they need to do the right kind of research so they can keep up with this
4876684 they know the power of the military will come down on them

4876686 im not sure we could have stood being apart 30 of the next 42 months at the start of our marriage thats a long time when youre real young
4876687 somebody whos violent and controlling of his partner before he leaves will spend a lot of time while hes away wondering what shes doing worrying that he doesnt have that day to day control
4876688 he comes back with the attitude that it needs to be re established as firmly as possible
4876689 the biggest problems usually revolve around money the husband may not have given the wife access to funds
4876690 often the guy comes back tells his wife im not interested in you any more
4876691 once it starts to affect performance im involved and want to know every detail its miserable stuff but its my job
4876692 their commander said they wouldnt be of any use until the problems were resolved
4876693 deployments dont help in strengthening a marriage but they do not have to kill marriages
4876694 the families are scattered everywhere and we dont have the support networks that active duty does
4876695 theres very little attention paid to reintegration bammo you suddenly go back to your civilian life i havent spoken to anyone who hasnt experienced some degree of stress on a marriage
4876696 the children of these families are suffering damage emotionally and a lot of them arent getting any help
4876697 were going to have fallout from this for a long time
4876698 to go off for one deployment for a year is difficult but when that soldier comes back people are able to adjust to heal
4876699 when you go a second time and are threatened with the possibility of a third its just devastating

4876720 what i wanted to do when i came into the circle because i knew i was one of the first throwers she was out fourth was to put the presssure on the other throwers obviously it worked
4876721 every time they hopped into the circle i was always keeping an eye out because you never let your guard down until the competition is over
4876722 thats why every time i tried to throw it as far as i could i was just so happy that my series right through the competition was awesome
4876723 you know thats something you dont plan it just all happens naturally
4876724 as soon as i saw on the board that it came up that she had won i thought instantly screw the last throw ive done it ive won all i wanted to do was get to the fence and give my coach a massive hug just to celebrate the moment and soak it all in
4876725 its just such an awesome feeling to be out there with so many people around you youve busted your arse in training so hard for this one moment and to have whatever the capacity of the stadium is 91 000 here celebrating with you is just amazing

4876929 i just happened to look on your other side and saw the open pill bottle thats when i screamed for your mom and she called 911 after that the proceeds are a little obvious
4876930 im sorry i really am i didnt think you would be the one to find me
4876931 obviously truthfully im glad you did and not her she probably would have beat me to wake me up
4876932 i thought she was going to hit the poor ambulance staff she was so mad and upset
4876933 ill be back later with clothes and a toothbrush and stuff
4876934 stop looking at me like i am going to pull out a blade and start cutting right here

4876950 im fine its not that bad that i need to talk to someone i can deal
4876951 bullshit i know you better than that not to mention that handprint is too big to be his
4876952 not really he is a big boy for only being in 4th grade
4876953 no it would have been worse if i would have
4876954 fight back next time then maybe she wont step all over you
4876955 i gave my parents a reason to be so ashamed of me now they actually have a reason to call me a bad daughter and a horrible child like they always do
4876956 my stomach and ankles and the bottoms of my feet

4876988 eu e o moraci tivemos pouco tempo em termos de trabalho n s fizemos um esquema com ajuda de uma cria minha aqui no clube que o neto que trabalha muito bem no computador mas esse grupo vai crescer muito gostei de lidar com eles um pessoal limpo um pessoal do bem um exemplo de grupo de jogadores de futebol
4876989 eles correram porque quiseram correr eles jamais deram chance para o advers rio o m rito todo dos jogadores meu discurso sempre vai ser esse depois de uma vit ria tentei passar para os jogadores mas muita coisa que eles fizeram foi improvisa o deles o ferreira por exemplo se n o puder usar a cria o que o forte ele est morto
4876990 perder faz parte do jogo ali no vesti rio eu vi que os jogadores t m a tristeza da derrota mas eles tamb m t m que ter a certeza de que eu fiquei satisfeito porque o time n o se intimidou mostrou qualidade e a que temos que analisar com os jogadores o que precisamos melhorar
4876991 o diogo um grande jogador mas ele est resolvendo a situa o dele mas n s temos que saber jogar sem ele tamb m e hoje o time se portou muito bem infelizmente tomamos o gol no final mas em compensa o nos portamos bem enquanto nos outros jogos estivemos mal
4876992 isso foi o que eu disse a eles no vesti rio eu vi que voc s podem voc s n o amarelaram fora de casa voc s t m condi es de manter o mesmo aproveitamento fora e sair para somar pontos
4876993 isso que tem servir de insentivo de confian a para o pr ximo jogo fora do canind temos que sair para jogar mesmo e conquistar pontos

4876995 in terms of worldwide shipments it is the first time for a taiwan it brand to create such a huge impact in the global market by a single product
4876996 what are you willing to give up to find what you are looking for
4876997 oh youve been singing nonstop for your entire life and ive encouraged you but now you cant go on tour
4876998 we have to have work as a centerpiece of any reform
4876999 we just couldnt get the z line designs toyota where we needed it to be we started each run off really really tight and went backwards really quick we kept working on it and wed get a little closer then wed fall off wed get a little closer then wed fall off again
4877000 that kept us in it that was really cool we needed one more caution and one more pit stop to make something happen to free it up even more and we didnt have an opportunity to do it
4877001 what to do where to run the draft is really big at michigan you haul the mail and then you get right next to another car and its like hitting the brakes the draft is a big deal and i learned a lot today
4877002 there were a couple of cars that were really fast tony stewart was real fast and brian vickers was extremely fast the changes my crew made were great and they made our car real fast for the final run and tony was having that trouble on pit road or whatever happened to him it was sure a lot easier to pass him there in the pits than it would have been on the race track we came out first our guys did a great job and it went green the rest of the way
4877003 it was a good run but to be quite honest with you you dont want to come across greedy but at the same time im getting sick and tired of not winning one of these race
4877004 i feel like every race that weve been in weve led we just havent led at the right time
4877005 we had a good day and its been fun to run that car this year
4877006 its one of those days when youre sad the year is over from this standpoint but im so proud of crew chief dave rogers and all those guys we got in a great battle you could get two or three guys together and it got really racy and i dont think ive ever been a part of anything that was that much fun here at michigan
4877007 i got us a little bit off today and it got us a little bit too tight in the center
4877008 dave rogers crew chief and this whole old spice team theyve done such a great job theyre in a record setting year and its just been an honor to drive the car for them
4877009 this was our last race with joe gibbs racing in the nationwide series
4877010 im just really thankful to dave rogers and all of the guys on this old spice team its been fun to run that car this year and to run for dave who everyone knows was an engineer on my nascar sprint cup team years ago its one of those days where youre kind of sad your year is over but im so proud of dave and all of those guys and the entire organization the 18 team and the 20 team theyve done just amazing things in the last couple of years theyre not done yet theyve got the rest of the year i got a feeling the record that they set is going to keep growing
4877011 todays race reminded me of what i can imagine daytona was like without restrictor plates and with the slingshot and everything
4877012 you could get two or three guys there and it really got racy and fun i dont think ive ever been a part of anything that was that much fun here at michigan
4877013 these cars are so momentum driven and with the horsepower that weve had taken away it really made that even more critical today you had to make sure that you kept your momentum up and didnt get the car bound up in any way
4877014 when you could get two or three guys racing like that it was really fun guys could go in below you and slide up right in front of you and you could turn and go back underneath them thats something that i dont think ive ever seen here in michigan early in the race we got with carl edwards and brian vickers and that pretty much set the tone for the day of knowing who was going to be good and be there at the end of the race and thats the way it shaped up
4877015 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4877016 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4877017 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4877018 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4877019 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4877020 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4877021 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4877022 a huge adrenaline rush ive never been on a race track before never once and we were going pretty fast by the end of this

4877026 when this first occurred i said whatever the republicans do with their delegations we will do the same the difference is we will have a food fight in the middle
4877027 it seems our party cannot avoid having a free for all
4877028 it has always been my opinion that the michigan delegation would have a full vote at the convention
4877029 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
4877030 democrats in florida and michigan must know they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
4877031 arkansas is a state where persuasion i think is going to be a larger factor than a massive registration program
4877032 in the past its always been going out and encouraging and begging people to register to vote
4877033 more than ever i receive calls from people wondering where can i register how can i early vote
4877034 peace advocates will likely have the best funded antiwar message in history
4877035 tens of millions of dollars will be raised for voter education and registration and get out the vote campaigns through the 527 committees which disseminateread more digg story
4877036 so i would say there is a growing awareness in design people are more and more interested in it
4877037 humanising the stories and adopting language that is user friendly
4877038 relate back to people what they do how they live within their space
4877039 kates ideas are condensed and rarefied but ours are more commercial
4877040 you feel freer online to voice your opinion websites do not cost a lot to run and are free from restrictions presented by advertising
4877041 occasionally you can massage something to fit into your format but that process is almost insulting

4877065 one of the things that surprised me because i grew up in england was that people here northern ireland protestants and i only learned this fairly recently protestants would have been taught as children that they could not trust catholics i found that astonishing but when i explored it with protestant friends they all agreed that was the case
4877066 i could never understand why it mattered that i was a catholic police ombudsman it baffled me but eventually i was told this was the teaching of some churches to their people and that meant i could understand a lot of what has been said about me

4877111 its only in the mysterious equations of love that any logical reasons can be found
4877112 it went well today the big thing is nobody got hurt the offense really played well had great command out there and moved the ball well i thought our number one defense played well it was a good confidence builder on both sides of the football we put our punters and kickers in front of the crowd and the media to see what they could do for an open tryout well break the tape down and see where we go well stat to settle in some positions starting next week
4877113 i think the big thing is getting a better rhythm offensively so we dont have the pre snap penalties all those little things really hold your team back so we have to get better at that we would also like to have some more tackling drills and more tackling team periods to get our defense more work i also think we need to improve on all special team phases
4877114 it was a good stretch for them they had no days off we tested them mentally as well as physically and we had one of our most spirited practices that weve had since we started camp they fought all the way through and now they get a day off tomorrow they deserve it
4877115 ryan has shown some separation all the way through camp and he definitely played well today i dont want to jump in front of coach miller before he breaks the tape but he looked good today
4877116 i think from day one he possessed great leadership skills and he also had maturity along with it it was just a matter of learning the offense for him and he can be a dynamite player before its all said and done he is one of our better leaders so i am looking forward to what he can do in the future
4877117 i thought they really caught the ball well today had a nice day and roberto wallace had his moments vincent brown has been hurting lately but he came out and played well it was a good performance by the receivers
4877118 atiyyah is fast right now hes had his best summer and it is paying off for him he is a different kid right now im really proud of him hes come a long way
4877119 its hard to tell the situations were so contrived when our first team defense was on the field we were going against the second team offense and out second offense is kind of beat up right now so the challenge wasnt great when out first team offense was on the field it was against the no two defense which is beat up a little bit i dont think we learned about much about how we will compete in the fall other than i thought we were pretty sharp with our assignments and the guys tackled very well thats all we were really after today
4877120 there were guys who played well i thought our corners played well they have played well during camp so there are some encouraging signs i dont think it can be definitive from todays performance but i think were on the right track if we can just get healthy and stay healthy i think we have a chance
4877121 everything was pretty plain vanilla because it was an open scrimmage i was pretty pleased played well he was very consistent he created a couple of big plays the receivers played pretty well the offensive line thats been the big thing through camp has really showed some improvement they really solidified that portion of the game the running back situation has some competition right now
4877122 he was a great leader his work ethic was amazing he is an amazing guy
4877123 you know what i feel you have to start with one step first you get a first down then you get another first down and you start scoring the way i see it if we keep getting first downs then we should be winning some ballgames
4877124 i feel like i have a lot more experience with the people i have been with
4877125 we have been working hard everybody is in shape its a lot of technique stuff right now i like the way the defense is playing right now too
4877126 i feel like i have a lot of pride in this town i was born and raised in the 619 area code and east county im a san diego kid i have a lot of pride in san diego and san diego state athletics i mean whenever we succeed it really cheers the city up i would like to see people excited about san diego state football
4877127 the biggest thing is we are tight as a team the camaraderie the loyalty and the faith we have in each other is something that we havent had in the past and that will take you a long way
4877128 we really feel confident in each other and ourselves the confidence will take us a long way
4877129 the number one thing for me is making game changing plays i need to be the kind of guy who can pull us out when something is going wrong and who can get things sparked up when we need to
4877130 we are lot more improved than last year we have come a long way from last year we are more experienced and we kind of mesh together as a defense
4877131 ive had a lot of fun the coaches have always talked about moving me over there ive always been a defensive guy
4877132 in a way i just want to play defense because thats where i have always been coach long sat me down over the summer and said look you know wed like to give you a try and see how it goes and i kind of gave into him so far ive got a lot of help from the offensive line everyone has been helping out a lot and been real supportive its been really great
4877133 its a natural fit and i feel really good i try to get better every day and i want to do the best that i can to help these guys because they have helped me so much
4877134 i think it went pretty well on offense i feel like we still have to limit our pre snap penalties but as a whole it was good
4877135 customer service wachovia style former hotel executive runs the show

4877139 ultimately there needs to be recognition in our immigration program that there are people already in the pacific being displaced because of climate change people having to leave small atolls and islands because of sea level rises
4877140 we think there needs to be a special category in our humanitarian program that recognises the displacement caused by climate change
4877141 our goal is to get the iphone client out as quickly as possible because it does represent a significant percentage of the devices touching our network
4877142 the apple guys are really smart and they have a beautiful phone

4877144 at least 1 primary outcome that was changed introduced or omitted
4877145 all research involving humans and animals must have been approved by the authors institutional review board or equivalent committee
4877146 first manufacturers need no longer limit their promotion of off label uses to drugs and indications for which they are working toward fda evaluation and second there is no requirement for advance fda review of the journal articles to be distributed
4877147 the requirement that information passed on by industry be limited to peer reviewed journal articles may do little in practice to ensure the scientific quality of the evidence contained therein
4877148 what does it mean to be peer reviewed if the company has essentially conceived the article composed the draft and written the paper
4877149 eliminates any incentive for industry to invest in studies beyond those necessary to earn preliminary approval
4877150 the fda might be left out of the regulatory loop for many of the indications for which companies market drugs to physicians
4877151 in embracing the open access model hhr aligns itself with a global movement for the democratization of scientific knowledge production and a more equitable distribution of the benefits of science particularly in health hhrs distinctive contribution to this movement will come through the journals systematic linking of conceptual and legal human rights analysis with documentation of concrete front line experiences translating rights principles into social change and health progress on the ground
4877152 web only features including policy analyses issue briefs and advocacy documents as well as invited opinion pieces and short essays aimed to stimulate debate on health and rights
4877153 the website will also provide links not only to other online journals and information resources but to emergent spaces in which communities of practice are organizing to strengthen peer to peer learning among practitioners in rights based health program design and service delivery for example the in the interests of full disclosure i ought to declare two things
4877154 excluding the poor from accessing biomedical literature a rights violation that impedes global health
4877155 through its transition from a subscription based to an open access journal that publishes materials under the creative commons attribution license health and human rights joins the knowledge commons movement
4877156 answering that question with specificity it is above my pay grade
4877157 one thing that im absolutely convinced of is that this is a moral issue those who dont see that arent paying attention im pro choice i believe in roe v wade ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually they go to doctors and pastors and family members how do we reduce the abortions abortions have not gone down
4877158 i think for the life of the mother there should be freedom to have one
4877159 if you are consistent in your belief that life begins at conception then i cant change you on that we can work to reduce abortions how do we provide resources that allow women to keep a child health care support services adoption services
4877160 for me as a christian it is a sacred union god is in the mix
4877161 would you support a constitutional amendment for marriage as men to women
4877162 no i would not historically we have left that to the states i dont promote same sex marriage i do believe in civil unions for gay partners to want to visit in the hospital is okay in america i can give those rights to others
4877163 it was only embryos that could be used by the president i think the embryos could be used for good i think they should be used we should in a careful way go ahead and pursue that research if adult lines would work just as well we could use them and avoid the moral problem its not as if people want to destroy embryos they say we would not tolerate cloning etc or anything to dimish human life but in narrow human circumstances it could be good
4877164 yes darfur parents abuse children it must be confronted squarely and as individuals we can do this as individuals but we can do what we can working with god to get rid of evil is gods task we need humility evil has been perpetrated trying to get rid of evil we must have humility just because our intentions are good doesnt we do good
4877165 we are not here for a long time but here for a good time
4877166 a lot of arizona companies are interested in getting established abroad and many foreign companies are looking and coming to arizona
4877167 i didnt think arizona had a global pulse and global personality but after a while i realized that we do indeed have global links but theyre fragmented spread out and not connected
4877168 we currently have more than 100 foreign companies operating in arizona
4877169 the service her web site provides is valuable and essential
4877170 our food and cuisine lists is much more extensive than the yellow pages
4877171 my goal is to make people in the valley and everywhere in arizona more globally aware
4877172 emp ricamente y sin conocer cifras podr amos afirmar que el valor que le damos aqu a la comida en familia con amigos o al asado de los domingos es muy alto esta encuesta muestra que la valorizaci n la frecuencia y la duraci n de nuestras comidas semanales en familia son mayores que en otros pa ses del mundo
4877173 no cabe duda de que en cuanto a la salud f sica los adultos nos tenemos que ocupar de qu comen los chicos si respetan la variedad adecuada de alimentos y si reciben los nutrientes adecuados lo que es un problema importante en la argentina donde muchas familias est n viviendo bajo el ndice de pobreza y de indigencia
4877174 son las peque as historias que los padres o los abuelos comparten con los chicos mientras comen lo que los ayuda a construir su vocabulario y stos son ni os que aprenden a leer m s r pido y mejor
4877175 si s lo pensamos en salud como ausencia de enfermedad estar amos teniendo una mirada muy pobre comer en familia fomenta la educaci n la participaci n en la comunidad y la posibilidad de desarrollar proyectos que brindan bienestar esto tambi n es salud ahora cu ntos de nosotros tenemos buena salud realmente
4877176 we dont have an incentive for people to stay poor not zero sum their gains as they move up do not come at our expense china fear that they will catch up so we will fall behind untrue china has improved its standard of living is by selling us stuff they can make more cheaply than we can which is good for both of us chinas success increases our success improves our lives
4877177 present generation may not be improving over the previous generation
4877178 yes of course st fama and st french say so
4877179 if inflation for all six months of the period matches the rate during the first three months the next i bond inflation component
4877180 assuming the inflation index number would be the same in september 2008 as it is in june 2008 218 815 september is the date that is used to determine the next inflation adjustment for i bonds
4877181 federal tax is deferred until the year of final maturity redemption or other taxable disposition whichever is earlier
4877182 give them enough that they can do anything but not enough so they can do nothing
4877183 i know how hard it is to put food on your family
4877184 he knows that the thoughts and the prayers and support of the american people are with that brave little nation as they struggle today for their freedom and independence
4877185 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
4877186 a couple of u s stock funds or even just one a total stock market index fund plus a foreign stock fund and a bond fund are all most people need to cover the bases
4877187 if you have more then eight funds you should slap yourself
4877188 how many funds should you have four to six should do
4877189 as a general rule of thumb the more complexity that exists in a wall street cration the faster and farther investors should run
4877190 it does not take much to outperform the average investor all you have to do is put half your money in the vangurd total stock market and the other half in an intermediate term bond fund
4877191 oh by the way i also receive a 100k yr pension paid medical etc
4877192 a simmering conflict between georgia and russia erupted into war more than a week ago when georgia launched an assault to retake its separatist province of south ossetia prompting a huge counter offensive from moscow which supports the rebels
4877193 transportation of oil and oil products in the western direction by railway has been suspended
4877194 they proved themselves wrong and they showed that they were mature and strong enough to listen
4877195 as one of the foremost apologists for islamism in recent years
4877196 with a clear eye and not imagine either that we know exactly what we mean by syariah and just associate it with saudi arabia or whatever
4877197 i do not think we should instantly spring to the conclusion that the whole of that world of jurisprudence and practice is somehow monstrously incompatible with human rights just because it doesnt immediately fit with how we understand it
4877198 a normal adult never stops to think about problems of space and time
4877199 these are things which he thought of as a child but my intellectual development was retarded and i began to wonder about space and time only when i had grown up
4877200 all the valuable things material spiritual and moral which we received from society can be traced back through countless generations to certain creative individuals
4877201 it could be any figure the point is the figure is not what the customer actually gets
4877202 what is shown should be the real price in the market place
4877203 for example you can say a fare starts from rm9 but that rm9 must include all non optional items like fuel surcharges and airport tax as consumers dont have a choice about paying for these
4877204 isnt that more to the interest of the consumer it will help consumers compare pricing in shopping for the best deals
4877205 what will happen if all industry players were to start taking the cue from the travel industry
4877206 can you imagine all the noodle shops taking out advertisements displaying their noodles at rm1
4877207 by the time the customer pays the price will be rm3 50 or rm4
4877208 following extensive research into clinicians needs weve designed a laptop sized system that can help them get to patients quickly no matter where they are
4877209 the cx50 can produce high quality images regardless of the difficulty of the situation at hand
4877210 it allows full echo data analysis from a portable system without any compromises
4877211 there is no radiation wave the system is user friendly and can give the doctor an accurate diagnosis of the problem
4877212 so accurate it is that doctors can even detect complications in the foetus
4877213 in addition to purewave its premium imaging and doppler performance are possible because of its digital broadband beamformer and xres technology
4877214 a long time ago i called advertisements with half truths misrepresentation when i was tourism minister i also gave my comments and criticisms on that they industry players were very angry with me
4877215 now there are many health advertisements making all sorts of claims some of course are true but i think most are not
4877216 everyone now is very conscious of health and so when there is an advertisement on health food everyone would look twice at it
4877217 but the ads sometimes make ridiculous claims and we see that everyday
4877218 should we allow that the asa and the ministries concerned like the health ministry and the domestic trade and consumer affairs ministry should be more conscious of this
4877219 they should have a strong unit to look into advertisements in newspapers and television and haul up the culprits
4877220 the amendments to the code include some new sections one example is environmental claims like hybrid cars
4877221 terms in the advertisement like friendly and green must now be substantiated by the advertiser concerned
4877222 the asa committee which consists of newspaper bodies advertisers advertising agencies and media specialists can ask the media to deny the company advertising space and withdraw the advertisement
4877223 they can also make public the asa decision which would result in adverse publicity for the advertiser or even suspend the companys membership
4877224 such advertisements create an impression that the product is a cure for a particular ailment
4877225 moreover these ads never indicate how much of the product you can safely take whether scientific studies have been done on it and what side effects it could possibly have
4877226 the question is whether the advertisement would sway a reasonable consumer into error
4877227 to me advertisements like these are a form of bait advertising as youre baiting the consumer to go and further check things out
4877228 i consider this misleading as you are not stating the actual price of a product or service you are only stating a part of the price and this is an inadequate price indication
4877229 this concept does not arise under the cpa the cpa is based on a relational theory of contracting which emphasises the importance of relational norms such as trust and co operation in contracting
4877230 what the judge has to decide is whether the advertisement would lead a reasonable consumer into making an erroneous judgment
4877231 we are frequently told that the law is difficult to enforce in a developing country we dont enforce it not because the country is not yet developed but because our regulators and captains of industry are underdeveloped
4877232 the cpa is quite clear the domestic trade and consumer affairs ministry just has to take action
4877233 my concept of enforcement is not just taking the errant advertisers to court where the case drags on for years the ministry can in the first instance meet with the companies concerned and specify the right way of doing things
4877234 the objective is to just prevent mischief from taking place
4877235 this is because an advertisement may be aired across all or any channels and it would not be fair to attribute fault to any one particular broadcaster
4877236 complaints received on advertisements are first evaluated against section 211 of the communications and multimedia act 1998 that is whether the advertisement is indecent obscene false menacing or offensive in character with intent to annoy abuse threaten or harass any person
4877237 all complaints received in 2007 and 2008 did not fall within the provision
4877238 consumers arent stupid they may try the products once but they wont use it forever
4877239 the client is the one who will suffer the clients are only cheating themselves
4877240 this was an industry that was taking out huge full page colour advertisements in the papers everyday on downloading songs and other things
4877241 many scammed consumers and made a lot of money out of it the government had to come in and control them and the whole industry died
4877242 this influences children there should be a total ban of this as far as im concerned but then again its not mass advertising so it doesnt really fall under our ambit
4877243 those days you could use while stocks last because there were enough resources to channel we should look at some of these phrases because while stocks last could mean 10 hours or two seconds its a bit unfair
4877244 you should also look at supermarkets that offer low prices but when you go to the supermarket the item is finished i think that is also misleading
4877245 i think they must specify by what time or they must have stock they cannot make consumers drive all the way and find that theres nothing left
4877246 we dont advertise fast food for any programmes watched by children below nine
4877247 we are right now also looking at restraining advertising junk food to children of that age also
4877248 the digital area will be very tough that digital industry should come up with own rules how will you control foreign advertising on the internet
4877249 these complaints relate to the housing industry service providers goods and fast food but the most number of complaints were against slimming ads and air fares
4877250 there were insufficient evidence to prosecute in the other cases
4877251 the point is that it must be clear to the consumer whether it is clear or not is very subjective and must be decided on a case by case basis
4877252 consumers have complained that often the final transaction was not what was promised in the advertisement
4877253 these usually relate to used cars travel businesses and time share holidays these areas have had advertisements which have been misleading
4877254 the gen y is going to be the driving force of the future workplace companies slow in being in sync with this generation will appear to be less attractive work place it will be hard to get talent
4877255 im instant messaging has become the new coffee place or water fountain
4877256 if we dont understand these we will run into resistance in coaching them when they leave it could be the companys loss
4877257 it needs to be worn 20 hours a day four hours less than rigid braces
4877258 once the brace fitting is done your doctor will show you how to put it on properly and give you instructions on wearing it
4877259 a holistic education thorough and wholesome it taught me about life philosophy and humanity
4877260 but began to appreciate what i was receiving was not only professional education at its best but also ethics moral values genuine friendship theatre classical music and australian sports
4877261 today most of our malaysian students abroad are pressured by their parents and peers to pursue their studies in money making industries with the result that we have a wide gap in the intellectual areas without philosophy arts and culture our nation building will be shallow
4877262 we must endeavour to achieve a balanced and diversified education
4877263 i picked a couple of new ideas lets hope i can now surf ha ha

4877272 love is a minefield you take a step and get blown to pieces put yourself back together again and stupidly take another step
4877273 two people can be perfect for each other but if the timings wrong its never going to work out bad timing is the reason that most normal people end up single weirdos and creeps are single cos they are weird and creepy but people like us are single because of bad timing
4877274 i mean i cant even be around you youre sitting here and youre like this incredibly juicy ham sandwich that i just want to stuff in my mouth and i cant because like my lips are sewn shut
4877275 love is ecstacy and agony freedom and imprisonment belonging and loneliness it is what keeps us together when life tears us apart so when you find that perfect man hold on tight and call me so i can run over there and see what he looks like and laugh because he does not exist you sad perky little optimistic suckers

4877290 the ingredients of happiness are so simple that they can be counted on one hand first of all happiness must be shared selfishness is its enemy to make another happy is to be happy ones self it is quiet seldom found in crowds most easily won in moments of solitude and reflection it comes from within and rests most securely on simple goodness and clear conscience

4877374 virtually sacred the performance of asynchronous cyber rituals in online spaces
4877375 the virtual church can be considered as an extension of the physical church located in geographical space
4877376 what is concerning about this conclusion is the fact that sacred space has become intertwined with corporate or capitalist space
4877377 apple would gain nothing from telegraphing its intentions and capabilities by releasing public conceptual products the company is being more than prudent by not displaying their unconstrained fantasies to competitors media investors or customers
4877378 offers a procedural representation of legislative candidates opinions of public policy issues
4877379 it is obvious for example that the symbolisms and cults of mother earth of human and agricultural fertility of the sacrality of woman and the like could not develop and constitute a complex religious system except through the discovery of agriculture it is equally obvious that a preagricultural society devoted to hunting could not feel the sacrality of mother earth in the same way or with the same intensity hence there are differences in religious experience explained by differences in economy culture and social organization in short by history

4877414 well get you a spot if you need it if youll wear wyndham on the front of my cap
4877415 i told my caddie if i made this i would get in the bunker and do a snow angel
4877416 we just had perfect conditions for us so far this week but breaking the scoring record and still being behind is weird
4877417 lets see if we can break the 72 hole record and be ahead
4877418 its not a lot of fun its a year year and a half process to heal because theres not a lot of blood though in the elbow youve got to let the tendon re attach itself it was a long long rehab
4877419 even after about a year and a half i could start hitting golf balls but my brain wouldnt let me go ahead and go after it because it kept waiting for the pain it was very painful for the seven months i was trying to play
4877420 during that time when i wasnt supposed to hit balls i didnt push it
4877421 i really sat there and didnt chip didnt putt didnt do anything just let this thing heal
4877422 but you know im a pretty positive guy and i dont let things like that kind of get me down never really was down for too long
4877423 i jumped in and i did everything with the kids and had an absolute blast
4877424 we just hopped in the car and drove around for six seven weeks during that one summer it was fantastic it was like the griswolds
4877425 when i saw mark at the wachovia championship he said well get you a spot if you need it if youll wear wyndham on the front of your cap
4877426 i cant tell you how much i appreciate mark for offering me that spot even though i didnt need it
4877427 theres six seven tournaments that ive been calling every week writing letters im in a really awkward position having to do that now after 14 years on tour
4877428 hopefully i can take care of that tomorrow so i dont have to do that
4877429 hes playing really well he likes this golf course shooting 61 here were going to have to take it pretty deep im sure
4877430 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4877431 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4877432 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4877433 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4877434 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4877435 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4877436 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4877437 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4877438 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4877439 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4877440 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4877441 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4877442 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4877443 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4877444 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4877445 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4877446 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4877447 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4877448 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4877449 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4877450 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4877451 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4877452 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4877453 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4877454 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4877455 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4877456 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4877457 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4877458 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4877459 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4877460 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4877461 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4877462 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4877463 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4877464 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4877465 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4877466 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4877467 this is a planning took where all things are going
4877468 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4877469 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4877470 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4877471 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4877472 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4877473 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4877474 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4877475 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4877476 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4877477 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4877478 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4877479 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4877480 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4877481 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4877482 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4877483 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4877484 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4877485 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4877486 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4877487 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4877488 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4877489 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4877490 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4877491 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4877492 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4877493 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4877494 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4877495 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4877496 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4877497 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4877498 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4877499 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4877500 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4877501 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4877502 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4877503 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4877504 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4877505 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4877506 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4877507 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4877508 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4877509 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4877510 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4877511 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4877512 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4877513 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4877514 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4877515 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4877516 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4877517 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4877518 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4877519 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4877520 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4877521 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4877522 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4877523 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4877524 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4877525 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4877526 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4877527 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4877528 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4877529 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4877530 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4877531 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4877532 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4877533 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4877534 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4877535 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4877536 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4877537 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4877538 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4877539 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4877540 you take my ancestors away and enslave them and now you wanna take pictures of me
4877541 im indian you are stealing my soul with those pictures
4877542 i was in amsterdam and they dont have relationships they have the red light district
4877543 what if i took of your friends pants and started taking pictures of that youd like that wouldnt you
4877544 i thinking our meeting will me really cool for everything we have been saying about merging adult and student networks trust community and all of that besides i think it will just be cool to meet you

4877559 para tirar a diferen a depois de uma eventual derrota ficaria quase imposs vel nosso pensamento de decis o para tirar esses pontos de diferen a temos de recuperar os pontos que deixamos escapar no morumbi

4877571 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4877572 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4877573 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4877574 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4877575 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4877576 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4877577 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4877578 it isnt for a friend its for me keep it quiet
4877579 did you see the flowers over there they are for my mother she died last week
4877580 in such a city what is a good name for a woman in such a city what good is any womans name
4877581 dont lie to me mulder i dont want to know details i dont need to know details but her name mulder god tell me her fucking name
4877582 why do you need to know if it doesnt matter
4877583 because you hid it from me jesus god in heaven mulder you were married to her youve been sleeping with me telling me i was the only one for months now couldnt you ever say i was married
4877584 if i tell you her name what else would you want to know if i loved her
4877585 ill tell you but ill tell you this first there is no one ive ever loved more than you there is no one ill ever love more than you
4877586 she was my wife for maybe three months she wrung me out i dont think she loved me i thought i did i think i know better now
4877587 mulder why did it take you so long to tell me
4877588 it wasnt important until it was too late for me to tell you
4877589 numerous additional costs for citations issued to customers with express toll accounts who have not updated their account information
4877590 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honouring their word
4877591 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4877592 i dont think theres any doubt the major major issue is water and can
4877593 1701 also calls for the implementation of security council resolution 1559 especially the disarmament of the militias and calls for sealing the border between lebanon and syria and forbidding the entering of arms and weapons via the border especially to hizbullah
4877594 so hizbullah is violating 1701 big time and not only by hiding its weapons in warehouses in the south also we havent seen any weapons coming out of the south after the war of 2006 so did hizbullah throw its weapons used in the 2006 war into the sea
4877595 1701 says clearly no arms south of the litani river no militias south of the litani that is why unifil is here
4877596 i consider fear and loathing in las vegas to be comfort reading i like the al pastor tacos at tacos mexico and i count among my literary influences the chainsaw from doom

4877603 the first thing i thought of doing was to give all the nutritional supplements i have consumed my vitamins for testing
4877604 its almost like youre writing a book one post at a time
4877605 we are kicking off a new howdiduknow com promotion below are the details
4877606 for heavens sake dana open the door before he beats it down
4877607 five reports of abduction which anyone with half a brain could see were completely fabricated i cant deal with this unprofessional crap scully if we dont get a case soon ill go crazy i am so bored
4877608 instead of whining why not do something useful on fbi time like clean up your desk
4877609 but if i cleaned it up i wouldnt be able to find anything for weeks
4877610 if it helps ill help you clean up the office
4877611 well its a nice suit and it would get dirty and
4877612 no its okay mulder you can clean up the desk without any help from me dressed like this
4877613 good morning scully glad to see you could finally make it to work
4877614 wow i never knew the office could look like this did you have fun cleaning
4877615 ive found things that have been lost for years check it out scully
4877616 captain my logic tells me those things are carrying more germs and disease than the one remaining tab in your refrigerator from 1987
4877617 just admit it you dont like the ears you cant believe i cleaned the office and youre in a bad mood and somehow itll be all my fault
4877618 no im just stunned and hungry and wearing a really ugly suit
4877619 so please forgive me if i didnt die of joy because you finally got off your ass and cleaned your office
4877620 our office why dont i have a desk then or a nameplate
4877621 once and you put me off mulder how much would it cost to get me a nameplate hmm
4877622 fine i knew youd do this i do this wonderful job cleaning the office and because youre in a snit you have to blow me off
4877623 little girl in atlanta seeing ghosts lots of corroboration mostly from family i admit but its got definite potential far more than the rest of the cases that have filtered across this desk the past few weeks
4877624 really much more of this and we might have to start earning a living legitimately
4877625 better hurry mulder or well miss our flight and be stuck in atlanta forever
4877626 that particular thought dr scully is more horrifying than the last three x files weve investigated
4877627 oh agent mulder i just get so scared by them its like i cant wake up from a dreadful dreadful nightmare
4877628 im talking to strangers to see what i feel your face is
4877629 oh on the contrary i very much believe it in fact i remember a friend of mine who also saw ghosts would you like me to tell you about it
4877630 my friend her name was kate she didnt believe in ghosts until the day she saw one with her own eyes but even then she didnt realize it was a ghost at first
4877631 well kate had seen the ghost before that day and hed been alive in fact the ghost was her own brother and hed tried to talk to her but kate couldnt hear him then kates mother called kates brother had just died of a coronary for the next few weeks kate saw her brother everywhere trying to talk to her after a while though kates brother went away then kates father was killed in a terrible accident kate didnt see her fathers ghost but not too long after kate saw ghosts everywhere four or five at once and every time she strained to hear them but she couldnt then kate found out a dreadful thing she was dying and she realized that the ghosts had known far before she had because ghosts come more easily to those who are about to leave this life
4877632 stop trying to scare me im not dying im alive alive and so well i made it all up
4877633 i mean after all who believes in ghosts thats little kid stuff
4877634 bye agent mulder bye agent scully i hope your friend kate ends up okay

4877688 i think that maybe your leaving me would be better for you whether or not youll say it you know its true its my fault ive brought you nothing except pain i want you to be happy scully i dont think i can make you happy
4877689 i have been a bastard and ill admit ive been selfish these years ive enjoyed your company hell you make me happy i admit it my life is better because of you youre my reason for living i dont think ill ever stop thinking about you even when you go

4877692 i just tried my damnedest to convince myself to leave but this isnt over not by a longshot not like this

4877695 me too so weve been in love forever but weve never said it we chase monsters and shadows were hopelessly devoted to each other so why cant we even connect
4877696 i dont want you to go but i want you to be happy
4877697 for two people who want the same thing we sure cant make up our minds
4877698 fox would you just forget all the danger and the complications for one minute
4877699 a lot of evil has been perpetrated in the name of good
4877700 the russian troops are certainly not in any hurry to leave the country
4877701 it has come to our attention that representatives of hamed ehadadi an iranian basketball player may be contacting nba teams to discuss the possibility of signing mr ehadadi to an nba player contract
4877702 we have been advised that a federal statue prohibits a person or organization in the from engaging in business dealings with iranian nationals
4877703 i am sure he will play there this season because he has played great at the olympics he is a talented player he is ok for beginning in the nba after practicing a few years you will see that he will be one of the great players
4877704 the iranian basketball federation supports him to play in the best situation for his basketball career
4877705 we would like for him to go to a place where he will play not sit on the bench thats very important for our basketball and also for him
4877706 by the way we have here in europe some discussions about the famous
4877707 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
4877708 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
4877709 in the united states more than a third of women between 20 and 39 are obese some of them extremely so
4877710 change the way you eat and the pounds will take care of themselves
4877711 french women for all seasons a year of secrets recipes and pleasure
4877712 allowing citizens to carry concealed weapons deters violent crimes without increasing accidental deaths
4877713 suppose youre the director of a news bureau and you have two stories in one case theres a dead body on the ground a sympathetic person a victim
4877714 in the other case lets say a woman has brandished a gun the would be attacker has run away no shots are fired no dead body on the ground no crime actually committed
4877715 i think virtually anybody who would look at that would find the first news story to be considered a lot more newsworthy than the second
4877716 no question there is a bias in media coverage of issues relating to crime and guns
4877717 it has a bias for the event over the non event the thing that actually happened as opposed to the thing that never happened for the violent over the placid for the dramatic over the mundane
4877718 that i think is the most important reason why theres so much more news about things like murders when guns are actually used than when they are not used or when they are used in a way that doesnt actually result in anyones death or injury
4877719 my guess is for example few people would realize and understandably so that about a third of the public school shootings were stopped by citizens with guns well before the police were able to arrive
4877720 if you go through and do news searches on those cases youll find that only about 1 percent or fewer of the stories on those specific cases will mention that a gun was used to stop the attack
4877721 that particular part of the story seems to be systematically left out of the coverage
4877722 if you do a computerized search of news stories around the country youll find in the one week after the attack well over 200 separate stories about the incident
4877723 however only four mention the students having a gun in any way and only two of those four mention that the students actually used their guns to stop the attack
4877724 students pounced on the gunman and held him until help arrived
4877725 given that something is already newsworthy why is it that this one particular aspect of the event is left out
4877726 i think its hard to explain it on the basis of newsworthiness i would guess that saying students subdued an attacker or restrained him or pounced on the attacker
4877727 is probably going to be less gripping to readers than if you were to say that they used a gun to do it
4877728 the impression that we would get is that surely were talking about young kids who die from accidental gunshots in the home and that were talking about something that is essentially at epidemic type rates
4877729 but in 1999 the last year for which data was available when i did the book there were 31 accidental gun deaths in the united states involving kids under age 10
4877730 if you break down these 31 cases there were actually six cases in the united states in that year where a child under 10 either accidentally shot themselves to death or another child
4877731 kids are used by journalists as kind of an easy device to lend emotion and drama to their news
4877732 you wonder why children getting shot gets more attention than other kinds of death
4877733 i think its because its tragic and violent and dramatic all at the same time and these are all things that news is drawn to
4877734 youre talking about something thats akin to children in those homes dying from lightning strikes
4877735 to the extent to which these rare accidental shootings of children occur they overwhelmingly take place in households where someone with a criminal record an adult is accidentally firing the gun
4877736 whether its five or nine or six or 31 obviously it would be far better if it were zero but i think some perspective is needed here
4877737 you have to consider that there are some 90 million americans who own guns that youre talking about 40 million kids in this age group
4877738 its pretty hard to think of virtually any other item thats as commonly owned in american homes thats anywhere near as remotely dangerous that has as low of an accidental death rate
4877739 you have as many kids or more who literally die being caught up in combines on farms each year as you have children accidentally killing other kids
4877740 if an article actually passes the peer review test it has been vetted in about the most careful way that science has found to do these sorts of things
4877741 im not sure im convinced that refereeing prevents political views and other things from kind of going in there and showing themselves in different places
4877742 if i was a referee i would ask why only look at one magazine here why not the largest or the fifth largest
4877743 the fact that it had not would make me pretty suspicious and unlikely to go ahead and publish the paper
4877744 did the authors make the data available for other researchers to rummage around in
4877745 on the other two criteria he is way ahead of his competition
4877746 he makes the data available which means he is probably not cheating
4877747 he does it right and so i tend to believe the results that john has published in the back of the book
4877748 if you wish to be informed on the debate concerning guns and public policy

4877755 as the resplendent olympic flame lit up the night over the birds nest the world not only saw a modern china that embraces a 5000 year old ancient history but a fully confident strong and wise china
4877756 this rare night in beijing will become an important page in the history of world civilisation
4877757 the beijing olympic games is a new starting point for human civilisation to move toward the future now the expectation is for a more open china to make greater contributions to humanity
4877758 the pride of beijing is that we have fulfilled the commitments made to the international community for a successful beijing games we are also proud of beijing because beijing has not let down the expectations of 1 3 billion chinese
4877759 the 100 year olympic dream is the dream of a strong china and as the dream of a strong nation is realised so is the dream of the olympics
4877760 after the build up i was a bit disappointed it lacked heart and soul and was a bit too robotic
4877761 the olympics is about participation the money spent on such extravagant ceremonies could be used to support countries that cant afford to send athletes to the games
4877762 it should be used for something that will have permanent value rather than just shooting it up into the sky
4877763 if you had a chance to do something youve always wanted to do will you do it
4877764 the intake tube is a lot lower than what it used to be so it can pull water in and actually lock the engine up
4877765 i was on my back from colorado springs all of a sudden this big gush of water came out and its still coming out and i dont want to move because itll all just pour out
4877766 its better to take the time to find a different route or let the water drop down than to take the risk of costing you thousands and thousands of dollars for an engine

4877773 any form of fencing will damage the bridge during flood season as the bridge will be submerge under rapid current of water and logs from upstream will ram into it and may collapse the bridge
4877774 the fact that this event is even taking place is significant
4877775 it could provide an opportunity for barack obama to make some inroads but i think youll see john mccain stressing his conservative credentials
4877776 usually they go republican the fact that obama is in there with a chance of maybe getting a share of that vote is in some respects a great triumph for him
4877777 to be perfectly blunt its hard to imagine al gore or john kerry doing very well at this kind of a forum but barack obama speaks very movingly about issues of faith and values
4877778 the 65 000 new donors to the obama campaign demonstrate just how strongly the american people are looking to fundamentally change business as usual in washington
4877779 the strong fundraising numbers are a testament to barack obama s message of change and hope and his vision for americas future
4877780 this is now the fifth month in a row that we have exceeded the month before in terms of total fundraising

4877783 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
4877784 was having some health issues but he always said to me every morning that he was always good
4877785 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh
4877786 thank you bernie for showing that good people do come from englewood
4877787 bernie would wear colors that crayons hadnt even thought of yet
4877788 all he talked about was his family and this city
4877789 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
4877790 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
4877791 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4877792 its clear kilpatrick knew who detective white was he had previous contact with him through his other case
4877793 the official track brings it off the west coast of florida tuesday and wednesday however the track is always uncertain and the entire peninsula of florida needs to pay attention to the storm
4877794 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4877795 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
4877796 is deliberately misrepresenting the facts about our plan in order to shift attention away from the democrats shameful record
4877797 her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices

4877800 we dont have in our terms of agreement that if you miss a day you get a credit
4877801 we just do that voluntarily because its the right thing to do
4877802 so anytime something like this happens you risk hurting that brand and that can end up hurting you in the long term
4877803 from our point of view its really a non event
4877804 it was definitely a set up this advertisement was in a newspaper with the intention of robbery

4877849 pada bulan januari akhir atau selambat lambatnya awal februari apbd 2008 harus sudah disahkan

4877859 kita minta pertanggungjawaban pemp 2001 selama ini tidak ada laporan transparan mengapa penguliran pemp 2001 gagal
4877860 kita bisa mengambil pengalaman atau contoh kegagalan pemp 2001 yang berakibat 2002 kabupaten sambas dipenalti ini berarti kita harus bercermin dan belajar mengapa sampai pemp 2001 gagal pengulirannya
4877861 sebab selama ini tidak ada standarisasi keberhasilan penguliran sehingga kita tidak bisa mengukur keberhasilan itu sendiri
4877862 kami mengajak seluruh komponen masyarakat terutama eksekutif dan legislatif yang ada di kalbar ini tetap menyuarakan kepentingan masyarakat dan dengan tegas menolak kenaikan bbm tarif telepon dan listrik masyarakat berhak tidak membayar atau membangkang atas kebijakan pemerintah pusat saat ini
4877863 ini sebuah kenyataan dimasyarakat nelayan apakah harus terus demikian kami yakin dengan kebijakan pemeirntah megawati soekarnoputri ini hari ini maka memperpanjang deretan daftar kemiskinan di negara ini apakah pemerintah tidak mau atau tidak merasakan hal tersebut
4877864 coba bayangkan dengan modal membeli solar rp 100 ribu untuk melaut kemudian nelayan kecil ini hanya mengantongi hasil tangkapannya rp 40 60 ribu jika hal itu diteruskan maka akan menambah persoalan baru bagi masyarakat nelayan
4877865 kami yakin dengan kenaikan ini tentu pemerintah kalbar mampu menangani masalah ini yakni dengan cara mensubsidi ulang dari harga harga ketetapan pemerintah pusat dengan cara pembagian perimbangan subsidi dari pusat yang dialokasikan untuk kalbar diwujudkan kembali melalui subsidi lokal bbm khan sama saja daripada subsidi dari pusat dijadikan program program yang mengatasnamakan rakyat miskin tapi masyarakat kecil benar benar tidak merasakannya
4877866 jika kebijakan kenaikan bbm dan tarif lainnya tidak ada lagi kata kompromi oleh pemerintah yang berkuasa hari ini maka itulah win win solution yang ditawarkan yang jelas kami menolak atas kebijakan tarif tersebut

4877882 this may not be an indictment of men but it is surely an indictment on the kind of people too many women of this generation have become promiscuous foul mouthed male bashing sexists i am in my early thirties and i am thoroughly disgusted by the way many women who are ten years younger than me to around my age act where are the feminine women who know how to be a lady and respect men i guess women could say the same thing about men masculine men are becoming less and less there are so many gay men nowadays and women seem to want their men feminine instead of true men when did the line between the way men and women act become so blurred it makes me sick speaking of sick the way women and homosexuals idolize this show and these women also makes me sick women of this generation need to join us in reality

4877885 im sorry that my portrait of miley has been misinterpreted
4877886 miley and i looked at fashion photographs together and we discussed the picture in that context before we shot it the photograph is a simple classic portrait shot with very little makeup and i think it is very beautiful

4877913 in the physical types of allegory the gods were related directly and baldly to the nature elements by etymology so that hera was air aer cronus time chronos apollo the sun because he was unique a polloi not many and so on especially the stoics etymologized divine names and did so in the context of interpreting poetry or myth etymology because the chief handmaid of allegory as the allegories became more sophisticated though etymology seems to have occupied a more subordinate place

4877977 we wanted to push the offense early and create chances we were fortunate to score in the first minute of the game by winning a corner kick on a play that we had set up from the opening kick off
4877978 from an offensive standpoint there were some very good things done in this game we were able to get a decent rhythm going in terms of moving the ball at the same time we are a young team and while we saw good things we also saw many things that we need to work on we will work hard in practice this week in preparation for our home opener against uab on friday
4877979 at this point i just wish the game would come
4877980 your head coach is gone your offensive coordinator is gone do you believe that you will be gone next year from this team
4877981 no idea i think that the most important thing is the administrative aspect of this team thats the coaches theyll get to the players after the super bowl i have no idea i havent had any inclination that i will or i wont as far as im concerned im still on the team until im notified otherwise
4877982 do you feel like youve been given a fair shake to show what you can do
4877983 i feel i havent its obvious all you have to do is look at the balls that were thrown at me and the balls that i caught and how many drops i had it was obvious i wasnt going to be out there coach gibbs expressed his unhappiness but the first year i didnt see any excuse for it there was no reason why i shouldnt have been getting more passes thrown at me other than that the 2nd year he already expressed his unhappiness so it was obvious i wasnt going to be out there
4877984 do you agree or disagree with the offensive philosophy and personnel change
4877985 it was opposite of what i was told when i got here that the ball was going to be spread around when it came down to it it was only chris cooley and santana moss really getting serious looks at the ball
4877986 i would love to know what the sales pitch to you was
4877987 it was come on in here were going to have a blast were going to throw the ball around score touchdowns and have fun
4877988 thats where everybody put us so we definitely like it thats how its been since day one it didnt just because of super bowl week its a label weve accepted
4877989 its a tough situation being on the road and weve dealt with all kinds of elements from traveling to london to the heat of tampa bay to the frozen tundra of lambeau field its been a fun ride and we want to continue that streak

4878033 104 next we consider toward whom the upsurge enjoined with the words rise up unknowing aims for it is in fact an upsurge to union with the most high an upsurge that is above the mind and knowledge the reason for this has already been stated in part the upsurge requires neither grace nor glory nor relief from punishment or anything else for these yearnings for the upward action of surging up all that is necessary is the one who is the sole object of the human spirits yearning to be united a yearning that is found in a person who has turned his back on passionate desires within this sort of grasp god is gained above every human mind and knowledge insofar as he is perceived by a straining affectus so that he is not seen in his absolute and unique being but is perceived by a mode of taking hold that leads the affected touched soul above the mind and reason

4878036 did you think at the time if david gundersen could be taken from your life things would be better

4878042 how would you describe your emotional well being during 2007 darcie
4878043 the diversion of pharmaceutical products over the internet continues to be a major concern
4878044 rogue internet sites are in the business to make millions in illegal sales not to benefit the public
4878045 their motive in flouting the law violating patents and exposing their customers to unknown health risks was greed pure and simple
4878046 we had to look at the fact that we lost 3 58 teacher units because of a decrease in our enrollment so our funding from the state did decrease for 08 09
4878047 its balanced in that we have the money in the reserve to pickup our shortfall for the money coming in
4878048 its a good budget and we will be able to maintain our offering for our students with this budget
4878049 however we will have to monitor it very closely our hope is that there will be a turn around in the downturn of the economy so we will have more funds for the next year
4878050 this is a very good budget there was a lot of anxiety back in may
4878051 when the first legislative session ended we did not have a budget and when the state revenue makes up 62 percent of your budget it really creates havoc for planning
4878052 if you look at our debt service its only 2 percent of our total budget its remarkable weve been able to do that
4878053 the likely projects initially would be roofing floor covering window replacement and possibly moving forward with the goshen high gym project
4878054 that facility out there that we have is inadequate its actually become a safey issue with the size of the crowds
4878055 going into this we knew there would be only one champion
4878056 we have both wanted it so bad that weve pushed each other so much and i think that we became a better and a stronger gymnast because of each other
4878057 i think if it had just been one of us there wouldnt be someone chasing your tail and wanting to make you work even harder
4878058 of course we knew one would win and one would be second
4878059 i think we did prove that we are very strong we had a few little mistakes in two days its tough but 1 2 is not by accident i think we are very strong in gymnastics and there is more to come
4878060 we kind of have been going back and forth the entire year and knew it would come down to the final competition and it came down to our final event
4878061 i am very very proud of both of the girls
4878062 they raised the standard of womens gymnastics even higher today
4878063 both my parents have been a big influence on me
4878064 my dad is with me in the gym every day and he is the reason why i am an olympic champion
4878065 to know that he was so close to that and didnt quite achieve it i hope i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him
4878066 im able to give him some pointers about what to expect and to alleviate some of the fears and some of the doubts and reassure him that everything is going to be fine
4878067 ive been able to kick back and relax and go through the whole process with my mom so its been great
4878068 its a little bit challenging but i think its exciting to know that ive still got it
4878069 its an excellent opportunity for my wife in terms of completing her education and for my son for discipline starting life off on the right track and not a lot of debt for school
4878070 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
4878071 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak
4878072 at the beginning of this year earnings expectations started to drop precipitously and the stock market dropped with them
4878073 those expectations got built into the stock market and to an excess a lot of stocks discounted all of the bad news that was out there
4878074 though i was always keen on most sports at school i used to hate running but after what my mum went through i decided it was important to try to give something back
4878075 i saw the great north run on television and saw it was a massive event and decided i would try to get my entry accepted it was and ive been training since february
4878076 it absolutely does matter what age the man is men do not mature until they are about 45 years old and that is a stretch
4878077 if they dont cut you off before you finish the first sentence of your pitch they are hesistating and can still turn around
4878078 if they decline ask them why then use the appropriate response in the second column from the following table depending on what reason they give from the first column memorize this
4878079 campaign 2008 is starting to feel like a sunday school bible drill
4878080 were electing a president not a national pastor i dont see what good it will do for the american people to again hear the candidates spout pious platitudes about their favorite bible verses or how devout they are
4878081 candidates should appeal to the voters based on their qualifications for office and their stands on the issues not their religious beliefs
4878082 this event continues the campaign spiral into religious matters americans want to hear the candidates views on important issues such as constitutional rights public education the iraq war and the economy
4878083 why should one of these important events be orchestrated entirely by only one pastor who comes out of one narrow segment of our diverse country

4878089 the real owners are the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions forget the politicians theyre an irrelevancy the politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice you dont you have no choice you have owners they own you they own everything they own all the important land they own and control the corporations theyve long since bought and paid for the senate the congress the statehouses the city halls theyve got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies so that they control just about all of the news and information you hear theyve got you by the balls they spend billions of dollars every year lobbying lobbying to get what they want well we know what they want they want more for themselves and less for everybody else
4878090 they dont want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking they dont want well informed well educated people capable of critical thinking theyre not interested in that that doesnt help them thats against their interests they dont want people who are smart enough to sit around the kitchen table and figure out how badly theyre getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago you know what they want obedient workers people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork but just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay the longer hours reduced benefits the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it and now theyre coming for your social security they want your fucking retirement money they want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on wall street and you know something theyll get it theyll get it all sooner or later because they own this fucking place its a big club and you aint in it you and i are not in the big club
4878091 a conservative republican who has always held an entrepreneurial pull yourself up by your own bootstraps free market philosophy
4878092 the frustration i began to experience while trying to provide compassionate quality health care in the context of a market in which the accustomed rules of business economics dont apply
4878093 the answer never changed that answer was nearly impossible for me a free market republican to accept
4878094 until we remove the motive of profit from the financing of health care we cannot and we will not resolve our current health care crisis
4878095 any group that proposes reform policy that maintains the use of for profit insurance companies in a so called free market is being driven by one single motive to protect the golden coffers of their share of the 2 trillion cash cow
4878096 to continue down this road is paramount to suggesting that we privatize our fire and police services and turn them into for profit organizations you do that and people will die just like they are dying now under our current health care system
4878097 a small number of people who were not part of the main group seemed intent on causing problems
4878098 officers responded quickly and effectively to minimise inconvenience to local people and those attending the rwb event
4878099 i acknowledge there were delays for road users travelling between codnor and loscoe but the illegal actions of the protesters who blocked the road made those delays inevitable
4878100 the bnp stands for everything that we are not we are here as a trade union to promote unity for the betterment of working men and working women and the bnp stand for attacking those who have different colour skin from their own
4878101 i didnt see the demonstration myself we prefer to keep out of the way

4878104 i think it would be best if white house counsel writes the

4878106 not just because of the political consequences but because saddam hussein was a really bad person and there was no doubt he meant america ill
4878107 that didnt quite work out the way it should have but maybe i can try a little better that gives me the confidence to try things like run for president
4878108 because i dont think women come to these decisions casually

4878112 an issue widely discussed in the aids 2008 conference is the fact that several countries deny the entry stay or residence of hiv positive people because of their hiv status according to the publication entry denied published by unaids in partnership with other organisations and distributed at the conference at least 67 countries are on the list of those that deny the entry to people living with hiv aids
4878113 during a session on travel restrictions for people living with hiv participants decried the fact that although there is no evidence that travel restrictions have a positive public health impact 67 countries still have restrictions in place
4878114 a ban on people with mental illnesses or sexually transmitted diseases that is very amusing if the chinese government believes they can control every aspect of the olympics they are sadly mistaken according to 2007 statistics published by the world health organization the hiv aids rate in china is 2 9 of the population the ban doesnt seem to be working
4878115 many aids experts and rights activists find the new legislation to be a cause for celebration previously travel restrictions could cause more trouble than they prevented causing people with hiv to lie about their condition it was discriminatory and would also lead to many of the infected to lie
4878116 it is now up to the secretary of health to change regulations to reflect the new legislation hiv must be taken off of the list of diseases that mean inadmissibility to the united states but congresswoman barbara lee is confident that this will happen soon
4878117 one man came forward to express the sense of betrayal felt by those forced out by the restrictions he had personal experience as a us citizen living in canada with a partner who is hiv positive he still loved his country he told the panel but he was ashamed and angry with his government for initiating the repressive legislation that forced him to choose between his country and his partner as well as for taking 20 years to address it

4878128 because weve bought certain myths propounded by say medical science and belief in technology and things that our children and grandchildren will live forever and the idea that yknow we can experience a life without limitation but a life without limitation would be awful

4878246 im also realistic i dont think theres a drop dead day necessarily but if hes not letting the ball go a little bit by sometime next week its hard to imagine no 5 being no 2 on the farm

4878252 the fact that ukraine is no longer a party to the 1992 agreement allows it to launch active cooperation with european countries to integrate its information
4878253 i believe with this we are beginning a great movement i believe that this creates the basis for a tremendous development which will have a huge impact on the whole world in which the youth of the united states can help other countries in the same manner that we will have to go to other countries to help them with the same selflessness and enthusiasm that others have come here and as our comrades have gone wherever it is necessary
4878254 all in all our two weeks in cuba was an extensive learning experience of a post revolutionary building era of rectification and progression that would impact our own community work when we returned to the u s
4878255 singh used to have constant fights with his next door neighbour ram niwas 41 over issues like water from the mcd tanker on tuesday around 2 am niwas who had been drinking came over to singhs house and started abusing him a fight ensued between two and in a fit of rage niwas hit singh with a blunt object on his head
4878256 the family brought ram niwas to the police station and when we interrogated him he blurted out that he had killed singh we arrested him and filed a case of murder against him the victims body was then exhumed and sent for a post mortem at sanjay gandhi hospital
4878257 singhs body is semi decomposed and this makes the post mortem difficult however because ram niwas has admitted his crime we atleast have the accused at our hand
4878258 after years of denying it now we know the truth
4878259 i do stand here today your honor and accept responsibility for my actions
4878260 the letters tell me you are a person of great intelligence

4878262 to extend relaxation in marks and other concession at par with sc sts to all persons with disabilities irrespective of their vertical categories from the current academic session
4878263 as a result of this high cut off only 20 of the 210 seats reserved for the physically challenged were filled up in all the iits
4878264 the remaining seats have fallen vacant and nobody talks about it while there is such a hue and cry over the non filling of obc sc and st seats
4878265 the common merit list of top 7903 candidates practically does not have any candidate with disability and therefore fixing the aggregate cut off on the basis of the marks scored by the last candidate in the common merit lists amounts to fixing unrealistic targets for the physically disabled
4878266 because the education system in the country leaves a lot of be desired in terms of availability of suitable teaching and learning material trained teachers appropriate interfaces for conduction of examination and appropriate evaluation methodology the situation is all the more difficult in professional and technical course
4878267 while persons with disabilities belong to sc st categories get relaxation of 40 marks the same benefit is not extended to physically disabled candidates belonging to the open and obc categories this is discriminatory and denies them equal opportunity to compete on equal footing with the candidates with disabilities belonging to other vertical categories as against the endorsement of the supreme court
4878268 it would be desirable that the benefit of preparatory course extended to sc st candidates at the iits is also extended to students with disabilities
4878269 to declare vertical category wise merit list for persons with disabilities i e sc ph st ph obc ph and gen ph from the next academic session

4878273 i came to nepal five times between 2001 and 2006
4878274 however it was always like a tourist i never had any interest in nepals politics
4878275 everywhere i went people would ask me have you met prachanda
4878276 i stayed in nepal for a month and friends and relatives would call me up asking the same question i realised here was a man who was the centre of all attraction
4878277 when you live underground for 25 years even those very close to you dont know everything about you
4878278 for instance even prachandas wife sita doesnt for instance she says he never worked for the us and yet he worked on a usaid project in bharatpur for some time
4878279 yet it was a herculean task to create it in the subsequent editions i hope to give the skeleton flesh and blood
4878280 when you write a book you want your subject to grow taller
4878281 then the importance of the book also grows now i am happy that prachanda is the new prime minister
4878282 but as an indian whenever i talked to prachanda and other maoists i found them extremely cooperative
4878283 if we can help one child ild its all worth it
4878284 we will arrange for a charter to remove the individual on a commercial flight or a charter

4878294 although the nra and i have certainly had our disagreements over the year i hope that we can agree that the gun violence prevention debate should be based upon an open and honest exchange of ideas not on underhanded tactics
4878295 one of the reasons we have lobbying disclosure rules is so that the public knows whos lobbying the elected but also so the elected know whos coming before them and whos really paying them
4878296 we used informants that we would send to public rallies that these people were holding public demonstrations these informants developed relationships where they could pick up a phone and call in to find out where the next event was where it was going to be held they are usually very eager to have somebody come and tote banners and scream and shout
4878297 this reinforces what we have long known that the gun lobby will go to any lengths no matter how unethical to protect the profits of the gun industry in this country even at the expense of the over 30 000 americans who lose their lives to gun violence each year
4878298 this person was a very good imposter she knew all the right things to say
4878299 this type of malicious activity by peta in which it conspires with individuals to lie about their intentions to videotape and potentially disrupt medical research and then to launch vile disinformation campaigns against pharmaceutical research companies has got to stop
4878300 the fbi used to do this kind of work a lot in the 60s infiltrating groups like the weathermen or the black panthers all you really need to find is a good actor
4878301 it is a very unsophisticated but very successful technique find someone who can fit into the culture who can be taught about the group and then make sure they cultivate friendships and work hard most of these groups have small budgets and when they find someone who is dedicated and willing to work for free they can move up the ranks pretty quickly
4878302 it is mostly about education you need your candidate to know enough about the group so he can talk intelligently about their issues then you create a record of involvement get your name in paper write an editorial so it appears you have been committed for a long time
4878303 were definitely going through a lot of changes right now
4878304 kari decided to concentrate on her college recruitment process and so were going to go with what have were pretty confident we will make an impact in our new league
4878305 lewis palmer is the team to beat this year and we think were going to put up a good effort
4878306 were excited to come to this level and see what we can do
4878307 we had definitely settled into a role there in 4a so this will be a whole new set of expectations for us
4878308 i really dont think we can underestimate the value in having both our starting pitcher and catcher return this year
4878309 it provides a consistency and stability in the most essential areas so that we can relax a little and focus on other areas of our game as well
4878310 were really going to be relying on that core group of seniors as building blocks
4878311 we have some consistency on defense and were definitely feeling good about our hitting
4878312 we have big sticks all the way through the lineup
4878313 we believe in the separation of church and state but we dont believe in the separation of faith and politics
4878314 we need to learn to disagree without demonizing each other and learn to restore civility
4878315 get up in your face and say boy you really screwed that up
4878316 have to be careful to make sure that we are not creating a situation where people are being discriminated against using federal money

4878321 obviously mr weis and i are disappointed we recognize these cases are very difficult they involve very complicated medical facts and the jury listens to very different views on complicated medical facts medical malpractice cases are very difficult
4878322 we will consider an appeal but we have no intention to do so there are no issues that came up at the trial that would appear to be the basis for an appeal
4878323 its obvious that the jury quickly determined there was no evidence of any ongoing bleeding for 30 hours
4878324 we are what we think all that we are arises with our thought with our thoughts we make our world
4878325 can you make money on ebay using doba product sourcing

4878333 daddy i am afraid that i will never be strong enough to be a martyr for jesus christ
4878334 when you take a train trip to amsterdam when do i give you the money for the ticket three weeks before

4878340 el xodo es el segundo libro de la biblia y de la tor del tanaj la biblia hebrea y del antiguo testamento cristiano
4878341 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
4878342 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
4878343 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
4878344 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
4878345 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
4878346 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
4878347 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
4878348 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
4878349 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
4878350 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand
4878351 im an advocate for my child but we all have to play on the same playground
4878352 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it

4878354 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
4878355 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
4878356 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others
4878357 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them
4878358 i remember watching him in the winter olympics and he seemed like a really cool guy everything hes been a part of and done he just seems like a really nice guy that enjoys what he does
4878359 we hit it off really well and shes a great friend shes just a really sweet girl and we just had a lot to relate to
4878360 we talk on email and text messaging a lot shes the advice giver
4878361 were all such good friends all working just as hard they deserved to be up there too they deserved just as much spotlight
4878362 i have never seen a case so blown out of proportion
4878363 im trying to help get these people their life back
4878364 this incident began approximately three months ago when the subject befriended a 16 year old female under the pretense that he was a gulliver high school girls basketball coach and he was going to recruit her for the basketball team
4878365 were asking that anybody in the community that has been approached by this guy and victimized in this manner to please give us a call
4878366 im looking forward to going back home full time to broward county
4878367 forty years in political life and i turn 66 in a few days im looking forward to going back to what i love and thats practicing law
4878368 he is a role model for all of us and he will be missed
4878369 it was an opportunity not only for marissa but for others also to show how this government has changed how we do business in tallahassee
4878370 that story was a topic for several weeks but it did not set the department back
4878371 what i learned from gen butterworth is dont let conventional wisdom get in the way of common sense
4878372 it really is one of the most heartless things ive ever seen
4878373 the bottom line is you wouldnt treat a dog like this
4878374 should never have had a child like this in their custody
4878375 there would be absolutely no reason to assume that there was any problem they had been seeing marcus weekly in the home and there were no red flags associated with the family
4878376 i know not what wwiii will be fought with but wwiv will be fought with sticks and stones
4878377 anybody would tell me im crazy i backed down to make my dad pay for an ivy league education but it really meant a lot to me that i was going to go train and do the whole olympic cycle right i wasnt going to switch coaches before the olympics
4878378 most successful female solo artist ever selling around 120 million albums and 40 million singles a combined total more than any other female
4878379 quando si sta un po maluccio c sempre il modo di stare peggio
4878380 ma non rimette a posto niente se non lo fai tu
4878381 il tuo tempo sia passato ma semplicemente perch credo che sia giusto soprattutto per me vivere pi serenamente tutto quello che sar
4878382 so are you ready to go and tempt the hand of fate once again
4878383 we have to eat first or ill have to nibble on a real live human being
4878384 god damn it scully just slurp the damn dog and get on with it we have a dinner appointment
4878385 if youre going to do it this is the strategy people are using
4878386 its me uhhh your dogs name was queequeg and i once kicked it across your apartment for pissing on my bruno maglis
4878387 we do this whole identity affirmation thing a lot you chained the last mulder imposter to my bed it was a nice touch
4878388 last month remember i was in the bermuda triangle when i was in the hospital out of my mind on opiates i told you i loved you and i mean it scully i love you
4878389 are we having the long promised i hate the holidays fiesta
4878390 mulder you once told me that if youd been the grinch who stole christmas you not only would have burnt the whos presents you would have beat up cindy lou who for good measure
4878391 well i had this revelation two revelations actually butter cookie
4878392 i cant believe i didnt realize it was you right off your apartment is still a mess despite the glittery facade and youre still a lousy host now get me the eggnog and revelations mulder the cookies arent that good
4878393 well i had this sudden realization i love the holidays i watched a christmas story twice this weekend i did this i even seriously considered caroling
4878394 i know its very me i realized that too i never do anything in moderation its always one extreme or the other which often results in me not treating you very well
4878395 one day im all about appreciation and adoration but a lot of the time
4878396 youve said i love you three times tonight mulder i already understand your whole yo yo personality im glad its finally become glaringly obvious to you too but dont you dont you dare use the phrase i love you without realizing what it means to me
4878397 im not and never would use that phrase lightly but i want to know what it means to you and to us
4878398 it means this is for real its not something you say because youre in love with life and the holidays all of the sudden or because your therapist advised it to help you when you tell me you love me you better god damned well mean it and it has to be for me and not for you mulder do you understand
4878399 i do scully you are the most important person in my life ever and i
4878400 youre plenty good enough if you mean it i need to know its you and not the eggnog
4878401 i hate eggnog i got it for you and i mean it i love you
4878402 wow we had the talk and the world didnt end
4878403 well maybe it will once you see what i got you for a present
4878404 you didnt just redo the twelve days of christmas did you
4878405 hmm five golden rings oh so instead i get one golden ring and two sets of earrings from tiffanys mulder
4878406 mulder you if i didnt already love you this would be a major recommendation for it really
4878407 i kind of have a craving now for breakfast anyway and mulder
4878408 we are keeping the government accountable so on that score i think brendans doing a very good job
4878409 we coalition are getting some traction in a political sense
4878410 but of course we do offer an independent monetary policy in this country and of course i think its all pretty simple when the official interest rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow its really that simple
4878411 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all to not follow the official cash rate down
4878412 we do live in a market economy and we do live in a democratic country where we respect the importance and the stability of both fiscal policy and monetary policy
4878413 so of course when the reserve acts independently to put rates up that does put a lot of pain on households ultimately on businesses and it also puts a bit of a handbrake on the economy
4878414 en andere geheime genootschappen en personen biedt en op den duur zou kunnen uitmonden in een globale dictatuur geleid door de bilderberg elite
4878415 met het rapport van de accountant wappert in een poging zichzelf vrij te pleiten
4878416 dat leverde nauwelijks iets op maar dat is een ander verhaal een betaling was bespreekbaar geweest maar sinke bleef steeds zeggen we doen het gratis
4878417 sinke weet als geen ander hoe slecht dit is voor een beginnende beweging
4878418 ons gemeene vaderland is gered de oude tyden zullen weldra herleeven
4878419 usually im five but just for today i am six
4878420 i have to be six today because five is too young to swim with the stingrays so just for today i am six but really im five
4878421 its my first elvis week im a little ashamed to say that but it is
4878422 we watched it on the computer last year and i finally said i have to be part of that
4878423 but when we come down here we rarely see people we know yall need to come out
4878424 i have a velvet elvis but because of the rain we couldnt bring out all of our good stuff
4878425 i tell them he ate breakfast at 5 oclock in the afternoon but then hed eat dinner at 1 oclock at night
4878426 we always had a meat loaf cooked just in case he wanted it if he didnt want meat loaf then we knew to give him roast beef he liked soul food
4878427 the us final goal is not suspension but dismantling of iranian enrichment facilities at natanz
4878428 the big question on your minds is probably whether more job eliminations will come in the future
4878429 the only thing i can tell you is that we are working as hard as possible to turn around our revenue declines and we have had some local successes
4878430 but so long as the declining overall revenue trend continues we will be managing in a difficult environment
4878431 we must keep expense trends consistent with our revenue trends
4878432 unfortunately in the short term we will be saying goodbye to some employees who have contributed to our success and that will be difficult
4878433 the goal however is to strengthen our company for the future and to get through this economic downturn in a way that positions us to grow
4878434 what can robert sillerman do with all those old songs that everybodys heard a thousand times
4878435 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4878436 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4878437 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4878438 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4878439 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4878440 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4878441 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4878442 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4878443 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4878444 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4878445 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4878446 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4878447 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4878451 moet je je eens indenken hoe ze d r naar zullen gaan zoeken
4878452 kom ik vanochtend in de badkamer zit er zon joekel van een pleister op de spiegel
4878453 i have chosen you to be my bride very first thing jashua said to jeshua
4878454 how long oh lord will you not avenge those on the earth who have betrayed us
4878455 and i looked down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded and i said
4878456 as a snare shall it come upon all those upon the whole face of the earth
4878457 and you babylon is fallen is fallen that great city because she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication
4878458 for when you see the abomination of desolation plant his feet in the holy place america and sit in the holy place declaring himself to be god then there shall be great tribulation such as never was not even until this time nor ever shall be
4878459 because you have glorified me not neither are you thankful but became vain in your own imaginations your foolish heart has been darkened and because you have loved not the truth but have chosen to believe a lie you have been turned over to strong delusion
4878460 how dare you use my name in your corrupt and vile practices how dare you invoke my name in the detestable acts that you committed i tell you that you committed blasphemy of the holy spiritt and for this you will be held accountable
4878461 liars of everything good virtuous or honest who spawned lies of sexual perversion and licensousness to all who would listen these liars and deceivers will pay and pay and pay and pay sayeth the lord
4878462 hier hebben tijdelijk gerust 16 goede vaderlanders die op 13 april 1945 het slachtoffer werden van den duitschen bezetter

4878464 that man is intoxicated by the exuberance of his own verbosity
4878465 die kerel is zwaar onder invloed van de hoogdravendheid van zijn eigen geleuter
4878466 we were the first israelis to come to cairo and one of the things we were very curious about was how did you manage to surprise us at the beginning of the october 1973 war instead of reading the intelligence reports you should have read our poets
4878467 i am almost certain that it was the president of the united states the imperialist george bush who ordered the movement of the georgian troops towards south ossetia killing innocent people and with good reason russia acted
4878468 because this country rose up and now is a new world potential thanks to the work of ex president vladmir putin
4878469 venezuela has been following with concern the development of the conflict and in particular the increase in unacceptable acts of violence perpetrated by the georgian troops against the south ossetian population in this sense venezuela reiterates its rejection of all actions that violate human rights especially the right to life this conflict was planned prepared and ordered by the government of the united states which far from promoting the reestablishment of peace in the area went to work on encouraging the aggression of the georgian government the international community was once more witness to the reoccurring policy of destabilization and incitement to violence that north american imperialism is used to putting in practice in distinct regions of the world
4878470 whoever wins the presidency in the us learns and reconsiders the legitimate sovereignty of countries and understands that in latin america there is a revolution a peaceful revolution because our people have discovered a fundamental weapon which is the vote
4878471 the first thing you do with a little money is start to consume oil
4878472 so when we talk glibly about our desire to end poverty we need to reflect a little more carefully on what that means in actual fact one way to avoid environmental catastrophe would not be to end poverty but to end wealth it is wealth not poverty that makes the problem a self sufficient subsistence life may look to us like poverty but if people have all they need and enjoy life what is wrong with being poor
4878473 there is no doubt that were not going to save the world by buying organic food and clothes it will be by buying less
4878474 the most abused words are never again when they were saying that in 1994 it was happening again and again and again and again so never again to me is not enough
4878475 our eating habits also should be considered it is estimated that the food for an average american meal travels 1500 miles from the farm to the consumer studies have shown that the livestock industry contributes more to greenhouse gas emissions than transportation does we need to eat locally grown food whenever possible community garden plots community supported agriculture and re learning how to preserve foods will help as will reducing meat consumption
4878476 were consuming about 400 gallons of oil a year per citizen for agriculture tractors combines harvesters irrigation sprayers tillers balers and other equipment all use petroleum even bigger gas guzzlers on the farm are the inputs synthetic fertilizers pesticides and herbicides use oil and natural gas as their starting materials and in their manufacturing getting the crop from seed to harvest takes only one fifth of the total oil used for our food the lions share is consumed during the trip from the farm to your plate each food item in a typical u s meal has traveled an average of 1500 miles
4878477 u s farmers now produce 3 900 calories per u s citizen per day that is twice what we need
4878478 at another level im heartened by the thought of being in the grand tradition of women trying to write
4878479 its really really tough for the small retailer to survive against the big box stores if you imagine a small electronics retailer who sells pcs how is he going to differentiate himself from cant do it on price has to do it on service but you know the big box stores provide just as good if not better service than the small independent retailer so all that is left in the armament of the small retailer is a niche strategy of bringing in innovative products that simply are not available any place else that serve a limited market and in an area that just isnt serviced by big box stores and thats about the only thing that is left for them
4878480 if any of you will have to go to the bathroom between now and 10 00 go now because we arent going to let you out of line later
4878481 great i was just trying to call jeremy but the number didnt work uh we got a package in the mail for jeremy so were just trying to figure out what to do with it maybe we should mail it to you guys
4878482 we feel that nepal has found its hero for any epoch changing society we need a hero
4878483 after europes capitalist revolution napoleon came along to institutionalise socialism in russia lenin appeared
4878484 in nepal to institutionalise the federal democratic republic after 10 years of peoples war and mass popular movement prachanda is here
4878485 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal under the leadership of prachanda the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4878486 were in talks with the parties in our alliance and hope to form a government in the next few days
4878487 the integration of the peoples liberation army into the nepal army will see lots of arguments and counter arguments the way they deal with the army is very crucial
4878488 the maoists will try to bring in populist and radical economic reforms but financially they will have lots of constraints
4878489 he is a communist hardliner but now he has a responsibility to meet the standards of democratic principles
4878490 this is an acid test for him to prove his commitment to democracy
4878491 you are correct in identifying the shrinking of humanitarian space and the problems of confusions between the military and humanitarian purposes of foreigners who are here
4878492 the international rescue committee is firmly committed to protecting humanitarian space and distinguishing humanitarian workers from any military employees
4878493 the russian troops are certainly not in any hurry to leave the country
4878494 traveling gently on the earth what would john woolman drive
4878495 so great is the hurry in the spirit of this world that in aiming to do business quickly and to gain wealth the creation at this day doth loudly groan
4878496 what passes for optimism is most often the effect of an intellectual error
4878497 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4878498 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4878499 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4878500 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect
4878501 the americans dont want their dirty linen washed in public
4878502 no one has been taking any decisions and they must now start to act
4878503 he wants musharraf to be brought to justice to discourage future army chiefs and he wants his pound of flesh
4878504 weve all talked about it and laughed about it and in some cases cried about it and were all starting to relax now
4878505 hamas is trying through this so called legal proceeding to legitimize its human rights violations and assaults on the freedom of expression
4878506 they are using false claims to justify laying their hands on the property of the residents
4878507 our goal is to empty the hamas and fatah jails of all the detainees
4878508 we would have liked to move ahead with the project when iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad met with turkish leaders in istanbul on thursday and friday
4878509 but we saw that the preparations are not yet sufficient and we instructed our energy ministries to carry out a more detailed work plan
4878510 my aim was to come out and win when i saw the time im celebrating im happy
4878511 he was definitely untouchable tonight he could have gone a lot faster if he had run straight through the line
4878512 i think a lot of people dont realize that there are a lot of people out there going through childhood cancer
4878513 its amazing how quickly and easily an effective interface design can be created with our guidesigner software
4878514 the result is a system that owners will love to use and so will all their friends
4878515 we have even created a simple proof of concept windows application that acts as a server for relaying commands and feedback with winamp allowing iviewer to control the full functionality of winamp without any automation system hardware
4878516 iviewer really opens the doors for iphone interfacing with ip enabled hardware and software without the need to spend time and money developing a purpose built iphone application
4878517 doaj wants to increase the visibility and ease of use of scientific and scholarly journals and to promote their overall positive affect upon the scientific and clinical care community
4878518 ovds acceptance by this prestigious online directory recognizes the tremendous need for easy access by the world community for high quality articles concerning binocular vision optometric vision therapy and vision development
4878519 this singular honor recognizes covds ongoing commitment to research and publication of an outstanding journal that is now easily available to an international audience of scholars scientists and clinicians
4878520 thats the trouble with a war you never want to end
4878521 from a shitty war started on shit grounds and those prone to sudden explosions of racism in the big villain manner of the rest of the series at that im not sure it comes across as convincing as it could one of the benefits of writing 303 for avatar was that he didnt
4878522 i like the guy a lot b j is a wonderful young man whos going to be a superstar in this league hes a big part of our organization now and in the future but you have to draw the line at some point he listened to me i listened to him and well move along were just looking for a continuous effort
4878523 where is it are examples of those addressed by the ambient system
4878524 i believe it is appropriate to have an over representation of factual presentations on how dangerous it is
4878525 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
4878526 are you a complete fucking retard are you so fucking stupid that all you can do is bleat the bit of the paper that you like are you so mentally backward that you cant understand what the problem is with selectively quoting results you fucking idiot
4878527 the surface temperature measurement network in the us which one must remember is the best in the world
4878528 the surface temperature measurement network in the us which one must remember is the best in the world
4878529 this particular year was a good average bad year for this particular tree
4878530 just as an archaeologist must admit there is only so much that can be inferred from a single roman coin found in the dirt we must accept the limit to how good trees are as thermometers
4878531 obviously you wouldnt need to say this repeatedly if it was actually true
4878532 and you still cant spell or write like an adult
4878533 we look at the number of households and the number of tvs and then the proportion of tvs that are plasma lcd or traditional and calculate energy consumption based on those factors
4878534 most companies have been obliged to think through their strategies on reducing carbon emissions and they need to remember that their marketing strategies do have an environmental impact that needs to be included this is not something that is easily able to be measured
4878535 reality television is interesting as the more viewers and voters that tune in the higher the carbon footprint the more people vote the more it adds to the co2 in the atmosphere
4878536 some people believe with great fervor preposterous things that just happen to coincide with their self interest
4878537 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
4878538 sure i answer me too except when the cost is more than the cost of the house
4878539 or when it appears that the fix is likely to more damage
4878540 enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year
4878541 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
4878542 in general renewable energy is expected to remain more expensive than the generation it would displace that is its avoided cost
4878543 we are the true scientists the official white robed creatures representing purity and disinterested motivations our critics are not true scientists they are renegades or false scientists or have sold their souls to evil forces
4878544 buying bottled water instead of drinking water from a faucet contributes to global warming
4878545 only 21 of all san jose state university meteorology 112 students answered correctly
4878546 if i were a global warming believer this program would piss me off
4878547 in the ef student group this improved to a 53 correct response
4878548 the base year of 1990 was very advantageous to european countries in the uk you had already experienced the dash for gas from coal then in germany they merged eastern germany where tremendous restructuring occurred
4878549 the bulk of co2 reductions in the eu is attributable to reductions in uk and germany
4878550 japan achieved very high level of energy efficiency in the 1980s so that means the additional reduction from 1990 will mean tremendous extra cost for japan compared with other countries that can easily achieve more energy efficiency
4878551 the us economy had been booming from 1990 1995 us average real gdp growth was 2 5
4878552 native us automakers have declined but the numbers of autos assembled in na has continued to slowly grow
4878553 ahora rusia debe cumplir su palabra retirar sus fuerzas y detener todas las operaciones militares
4878554 rusia debe entender a partir de ahora que osetia del sur y abjazia est n dentro de las fronteras de georgia no hay discusi n sobre esto
4878555 las fuerzas rusas deben salir de georgia no estamos en 1968
4878556 el mundo ha observado con gran preocupaci n c mo rusia ha invadido un estado vecino soberano y amenazado un gobierno democr ticamente elegido
4878557 la prioridad ahora es cumplirlo r pidamente y en su totalidad
4878558 contraria a los principios de la soberan a y el respeto a la integridad territorial de los estados
4878559 what a bizarre little screed obviously youve read plenty of mcintyre and shared his righteous indignation when people fail to jump through the hoops he demands them to at a time of his choosing but equally obviously youve never come within a considerable distance of actual scientists or the actual process by which science happens your scribblings about how you think it might be are very amusing but way way wide of the mark
4878560 john galt if astronomers told you that an asteroid ten miles across would hit the earth in 2100 presumably youd say that was a claim that could only be verified in 2100 and therefore not science youd be wrong obviously and youd also have made yourself look extremely stupid
4878561 ill say it again john galt thinks that predictions of what will happen decades from now are not science because they cant be verified right now
4878562 the climate models do not output facts because many projections are for decades in the future those models cannot be verified for decades anything that cannot be verified is not science
4878563 as far as im aware there isnt a single gcm that has got within a country mile of an accurate prediction of present let alone future climate
4878564 well that just means that you are ignorant and you missed the point of the analogy
4878565 give me a model with 6 parameters and i can give you an elephant give me one more and i can make it wiggle its trunk
4878566 in a given situation if it comes to deciding whether the cause was cock up or conspiracy go for cock up every time
4878567 the falsification is more profound than ive made it sound
4878568 ive called your bluff and it seems your hand is empty demanding that i show you what i asked you to show me is desperately lame
4878569 mommy the nasty man expects me to understand fortran wah
4878570 no jeff i asked you to point out a problem just one in the codes and youve failed to do so
4878571 the strong emphasis placed on the realism of the simulated base state provided a rationale for introducing flux adjustments or flux corrections manabe and stouffer 1988 sausen et al 1988 in early simulations these were essentially empirical corrections that could not be justified on physical principles and that consisted of arbitrary additions of surface fluxes of heat and salinity in order to prevent the drift of the simulated climate away from a realistic state both the far and the sar pointed out the apparent need for flux adjustments as a problematic feature of climate modelling cubasch et al 1990 gates et al 1996
4878572 empirical corrections that could not be justified on physical principles
4878573 we poke stuff in with absolutely no rational basis whatsoever until we get the result we want
4878574 by the time of the tar however the situation had evolved and about half the coupled gcms assessed in the tar did not employ flux adjustments that report noted that some non flux adjusted models are now able to maintain stable climatologies of comparable quality to flux adjusted models mcavaney et al 2001 since that time evolution away from flux correction or flux adjustment has continued at some modelling centres although a number of state of the art models continue to rely on it
4878575 state of the art models continue to rely on it
4878576 1 5 3 the design of the coupled model simulations is also strongly linked with the methods chosen for model initialisation in flux adjusted models the initial ocean state is necessarily the result of preliminary and typically thousand year long simulations to bring the ocean model into equilibrium non flux adjusted models often employ a simpler procedure based on ocean observations such as those compiled by levitus et al 1994 although some spin up phase is even then necessary one argument brought forward is that non adjusted models made use of ad hoc tuning of radiative parameters i e an implicit flux adjustment
4878577 list of 500 scientists who have problems with the theory of evolution
4878578 a population of moths that changes from light to dark based upon environmental pressures is not evolution
4878579 an audi and a ford each have four wheels a transmission an engine a gas tank fuel injection systems but no one would claim that they both naturally evolved from a common ancestor
4878580 whether intelligent design is ever taught in school is probably not as important as the freedom that we have in a free society to discuss and study such issues and for that i am thankful
4878581 but before i can do that i cant help my initial impression of someone color my judgment if he was not a meteorologist and he was saying this would you trust him what if he wasnt even a scientist
4878582 the book of nature which we have to read is written by the finger of god
4878583 all of science is built on territory once occupied by gods
4878584 for those of you who agree that evolution is not a debate while climate change may be i ask again why is the climate change issue failing the peer review process that so defines science
4878585 on the other hand climate science is being used to justify trillions in government spending and a radical restructuring of the economy this means that climate science needs to meet a standard of evidence which is normally not required for theoretical science disciplines
4878586 elitist secular humanist group very well all of whom are dedicated internationalists and atheists and see their way to us and world power through the likes of algore and leftists including most of the media
4878587 because their is a gigantic conspiracy where the atheists are trying to take over the world
4878588 i just dont know what to think i agree with some points but im not sure about x
4878589 raven gave an interesting response which i dont wholeheartedly agree with but may have some sort of merit
4878590 humanists believe some things are right for some people and some situations that may be
4878591 anyways i dont really know which side to fall on simply because there is so much conflicting information out there and my knowledge of the hard science is very incomplete
4878592 anyways one thing that bothers me about roy w spencer is that it seems he has rather unconventional views on evolution while i understand that these are two completely different topics and it is much more appropriate to agree or disagree with him based on his evidence it does raise red flags when a climate skeptic holds views on another issue that is truly against the scientific consensus
4878593 we are glad to clear up the confusion which stems from the fact that the term
4878594 evolution is only concerned about the change in allele frequency in a population
4878595 the confusion comes when someone then tries to use the term
4878596 a population of moths that changes from light to dark based upon environmental pressures is not evolution
4878597 as a reader and a christian but rare poster to this site i appologize to you regulars that i must now stray from the topic of agm to answer alerk323s attacks on dr spencer and god
4878598 i assume you got your info from here http www ridgenet net do while sage v7i9e htm you seemed to have cherry picked your info word for word why dont you read on further
4878599 not so plain and simple after all im sure you are well aware that most people think of the second definition when they think of evolution i e the idea that man could evolve from some lower form of life
4878600 a population of moths that changes from light to dark based upon environmental pressures is not evolution
4878601 there is absolutely no evidence anywhere of a new species ever being created through evolution or natural selection this despite the fact that scientists who believe in the theory have been looking for fossils and trying to create new species in the laboratory for most of the years since the theory was introduced ill let dr spencer speak for himself from here on
4878602 the cumulative genetic changes in a population from generation to generation
4878603 there is absolutely no evidence anywhere of a new species ever being created through evolution or natural selection
4878604 you obviously dont understand the concept of writing to your audience dr spencer wasnt writing to a group of biologists biology professors or even biology students he was writing to the average person therefore the average persons understanding of what is meant by evolution is what is important not the scientific definition even is there was only one scientific definition
4878605 no they are not they are still the same species
4878606 but under my definition of evolution they are not evolving
4878607 ok i guess under your definition which is not the scientific definition they are not
4878608 the cumulative genetic changes in a population from generation to generation
4878609 change of allele frequencies from one generation to the next
4878610 a quick google search is all it took to discover the huge controversy around a subject seemingly as straight forward as the definition of evolution
4878611 there is absolutely no evidence anywhere of a new species ever being created through evolution or natural selection
4878612 the most important difference between agw alarmists and evolutionist is that at least the evolutionist arent trying to get the people of the world to spend trillions of dollars on their theory
4878613 he makes such elementary mistakes that one might think he never took a basic college level biology course
4878614 a population of moths that changes from light to dark based upon environmental pressures is not evolution
4878615 another thing he says is an argument refuted more times then i can count
4878616 an audi and a ford each have four wheels a transmission an engine a gas tank fuel injection systems but no one would claim that they both naturally evolved from a common ancestor
4878617 because he is directly addressing what the scientists are saying he must use their definition regardless of who he is talking too otherwise it does not make sense to argue with them
4878618 i could go on forever and would be glad too i dont mean to side track this discussion though
4878619 change of allele frequencies from one generation to the next
4878620 so again you showed me one other scientific definition and low and behold it means the exact same thing as my definition
4878621 you cant just wave your hands and make all of those examples go away
4878622 a discussion of speciation requires a definition of what constitutes a species this is a topic of considerable debate within the biological community three recent reviews in the journal of phycology give some idea of the scope of the debate castenholz 1992 manhart and mccourt 1992 wood and leatham 1992 there are a variety of different species concept currently in use by biologists these include folk biological morphological genetic paleontological evolutionary phylogenetic and biosystematic definitions in the interest of brevity ill only discuss four of these folk biological morphological and phylogenetic a good review of species definitions is given in stuessy 1990
4878623 that is funny you say that because the evolutions arnt trying to get the people of the world to spend money they already have people spending money the money spent on evolution faaaarr outweighs the money spend on global warming evolutionary principles are applied to alomst all aspects of biology including many aspects of other disciplines sorry to burst your bubble
4878624 isnt science supposed to be about the betterment and enlightenment of mankind
4878625 there you go again now youre using the word exact in all caps none the less
4878626 ha its actually a vehicle with an engine and four rubber tires look at how many different defintions theyre are
4878627 show me an example of an ape becoming a man
4878628 ok how about a fruit fly becoming something other than a fruit fly
4878629 oh that is a fruit fly too you cant show it turning into an elephant i bet
4878630 do a quick google search type the name of the study and the word refute have fun
4878631 oh all of the refutations are out there go find them
4878632 nope they are all wrong go figure it out for yourself
4878633 discarding 1998 and 2008 which can be as out of the trend as 1998 was i only see a relentless growth in temperature numbers
4878634 i read everywhere that the evidence is incontrovertible but what evidence do they have i cant find it other then co2 causes a small amount of warming in a laboratory setup
4878635 im no sure what if any qualifications he has wrt gw research
4878636 oh thats just the media the proper scientists dont say that
4878637 i am going to enjoy saying i told you so repeatedly
4878638 i do worry about what it is all going to do to the reputation of science generally
4878639 gore is a documented liar with zero scientific training attempting to control destroy economies based on fake science
4878640 the fact that the loss of ice on mount kilimanjaro cannot be used as proof of global warming does not mean that the earth is not warming there is ample and conclusive evidence that earths average temperature has increased in the past 100 years and the decline of mid and high latitude glaciers is a major piece of evidence
4878641 the following article has not undergone any scientific peer review its conclusions are in disagreement with the overwhelming opinion of the world scientific community the council of the american physical society disagrees with this articles conclusions
4878642 you see a judge ruled that al gores book contained some errors a judge
4878643 and you can keep your links to politically oriented blogs as they are always biased
4878644 the study by philip mote came out after gores film was made
4878645 mote and georg kaser a glaciologist at the university of innsbruck in austria noted that the decline in kilimanjaros ice has been going on for more than a century and that most of it occurred before 1953
4878646 the essential point that temperatures are greater now than during the medieval warm period is correct and confirmed by multiple proxy reconstructions
4878647 if youre not trying to strongly imply a cooling trend why show it with the above curve
4878648 here or in any scientific debate you do need people who are
4878649 incidentally this same conceptual model is used to claim a clear distinction between short term
4878650 what we dont need are people who argue only to win or to contradict whatever form of political heresy we put forward irrespective of the arguments merits
4878651 what we dont need are people who argue with us or to contradict us regardless of what we write irrespective of thearguments merits
4878652 doubt is not a pleasant mental state but certainty is a ridiculous one
4878653 in his final verdict the judge said the film could be shown as long as updated guidelines were followed these say teachers should point out controversial or disputed sections
4878654 the government has sent the film to all secondary schools in england and the administrations in wales and scotland have done the same
4878655 the smoothed curve is simply an aid to interpretation and offers one possible way of considering it
4878656 basically you chose a 5 th order polynomial because it showed what you wanted it to show correct
4878657 i believe 60 years is enough to infer a climate trend
4878658 it does not follow even in the presence of considerable evidence that anthropogenic ghg emissions are making a significant impact
4878659 i dont think you want anyone here who disagrees with you at all
4878660 i think it is a pretty good sign that a particular branch of science has a problem when it is focused more on
4878661 bbc environment analyst roger harrabin said the ruling would be
4878662 independent reason for thinking the system observed behaves in a certain way
4878663 you really need to read with an open mind the article at the following link
4878664 bbc environment analyst roger harrabin said the ruling would be
4878665 bbc environment analyst roger harrabin said the ruling would be
4878666 the following article has not undergone any scientific peer review since that is not normal procedure for american physical society newsletters
4878667 emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities are changing the atmosphere in ways that affect the earths climate
4878668 a senior u n environmental official says entire nations could be wiped off the face of the earth by rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000 coastal flooding and crop failures would create an exodus of eco refugees threatening political chaos
4878669 if you claim you dont believe al gore because he has no scientific background
4878670 while you will try to discredit anyone who supports or defends gw and or agw
4878671 youd lose the debate but you get what you claim you want
4878672 but not one of you has said you are open to my reasoning or the reasoning of gw and agw believers
4878673 the considerable evidence that anthropogenic ghg emissions are making a significant impact
4878674 so far as i can see your sole contribution of
4878675 but the argument behind that is that climate is a long term trend not short term
4878676 dont worry mike well exempt you from making any changes to your life
4878677 and several have correctly pointed out that there is little science being discussed here
4878678 the role of ambient temperature melt vs ocean water melt
4878679 are irrelevant caf is an artificial non economic mechanism introduced by government to coax behavior far better elicited by market mechanisms which is why they havent worked
4878680 when i even attempt to get to the science you pour on the insults
4878681 steveos explanation of and justification for the 5 th order polynomial curve was so weak that i simply decided that he had no real explanations or justifications i tried but could not get a justification
4878682 all series have been smoothed with a 50 year gaussian weighted filter
4878683 when i even attempt to get to the science you pour on the insults
4878684 yes ill follow your other links as well this is what im looking for from skeptics

4878704 when youre that successful you hate to see it end

4878712 where we are and where carl is even if carl stumbles and falls back its still going to take a low number sunday for somebody to win the tournament
4878713 i had so many chances today but i just didnt convert the putts like i did yesterday
4878714 ive played that hole terrible all week so ill just keep the trend going
4878715 at that point i got a sense that carl was still putting the pedal to the metal
4878716 so i had to make some more birdies i got back in the hunt
4878717 i told my caddie if i made this i would get in the bunker and do a snow angel
4878718 i shot 28 on the back nine he does something like that the tournament is out of reach

4878739 weve raised over 10 000 and most of that has come from the houghton side of the trip so were hoping that the response continues to go well here as we get closer to marquette
4878740 but of course we do offer an independent monetary policy in this country and of course i think its all pretty simple when the official interest rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow its really that simple
4878741 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all to not follow the official cash rate down
4878742 we do live in a market economy and we do live in a democratic country where we respect the importance and the stability of both fiscal policy and monetary policy
4878743 so of course when the reserve acts independently to put rates up that does put a lot of pain on households ultimately on businesses and it also puts a bit of a handbrake on the economy
4878744 so i think the public have got a right to expect that when official rates come down then rates set by the banks come down as well
4878745 we are keeping the government accountable so on that score i think brendans doing a very good job

4878792 whats so funny is that when the committee started announcing there would be a hall of fame we had a lot of letters that came back to us that said what about this guy and what about that guy
4878793 theres a lot of pride that came out of this the guys that were inducted they were shocked when they got their lettermans jacket when you win the masters you get a green jacket now these guys are bragging about their hall of fame jackets now everybody wants one
4878794 its going to be something that will go on for a long time we did something here that was really good not only does it recognize our past players but it helps our program in the future
4878795 we want to take a load off our defenses back
4878796 we want to share the load you put points on the board you win games
4878797 last year in the playoffs the defense shut down teams all these big strong teams we just didnt help out when games are 2 0 that wasnt a game we didnt know what that was we made it harder on ourselves there were times when we just didnt execute thats what it comes down to we got down the field but we didnt finish we get down to the 20 yard line and then mistakes would happen
4878798 on paper you think the offense is going to do better than last year
4878799 but you never know in high school until you put the pads on i hope the offense does a lot better but defensively were going to be very good again are we going to be as good i dont see vaughn telemaque and jurrell casey out there these new guys have to prove it to themselves
4878800 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4878801 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4878802 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4878803 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4878804 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4878805 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4878806 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4878807 i finished second four times and i really learned a lot each time i dont feel surprised because i keep learning and working hard and being relaxed
4878808 i have to play my own game and not think too much i have a four shot lead so theres a lot of room to play good
4878809 of course you dont expect anything like that that probably made my day
4878810 im making a lot more putts than i did the first day
4878811 all i can do is play the best i can and try to shoot a low score ill focus on being consistent hitting fairways and greens
4878812 it was such a long day and i had a headache so i just tried to concentrate on every shot
4878813 im out of contention to win now but i still feel i can shoot in the 60s out here and that would be a great way to finish to get back into red numbers

4878821 me forzaron a permanecer inm vil con mi cabeza gacha mirando mis pies durante 16 horas cada d a mientras recitaba repetidamente en voz alta las insultantes regulaciones del campo de trabajo forzado
4878822 testigo de la historia la lucha por la libertad de una mujer china
4878823 algunos observadores extranjeros estimaron que los adherentes a falun gong constituyen al menos la mitad de los 250 000 prisioneros registrados
4878824 desde la aparici n en 1999 de los primeros alegatos de estremecedores m todos de tortura y muertes en custodia hasta la evidencia m s reciente de sustracci n de rganos de prisioneros de conciencia los miembros de cipfg han solicitado repetidamente permiso para ingresar a china e investigar las acusaciones de abusos
4878825 sin embargo en todas esas ocasiones estas solicitudes fueron denegadas y esa es en parte la importancia de esta gu a ya que provee informaci n a periodistas que viajen a china para que aprovechen esta escasa oportunidad de acceder a un pa s para realizar una investigaci n independiente

4878828 designed to protect bald and golden eagle populations while providing the flexibility necessary for people to manage their land and businesses this program would allow issuance of permits under the bald and golden eagle protection act authorizing activities that may disturb eagles require nest removal or otherwise result in the death of or injury to a bird
4878829 the u s fish and wildlife service is developing new measures to ensure that eagle populations continue to thrive while providing a way to manage the impacts of development such a permit structure will enable the service to reduce the risk to eagles since it allows biologists to work with permit applicants to reduce potential threats
4878830 the draft environmental assessment lays out the biological foundation for a proposed nationwide permit program and examines the impacts of the new permit proposal within the context of all threats to eagles it proposes upper limits to how many eagles can be taken conditioned on increasing or stable populations under the preferred alternative the issuance of any permit authorizing the disturbance of eagles removal of nests or activities that could otherwise take an eagle would be based on the eagle population of the area

4879044 if we have problems because we are not doing things which in my opinion as a manager we could do i will work as hard as i can for the club
4879045 i will not talk about any player but in april i was talking about this behind the scenes
4879046 we tried to do things in confidentiality but sometimes you cannot and you need to explain before the end of the transfer window if the manager has an idea and it is not a question of money then we have to make the right decisions in terms of whom we bring in that has to be the decision of the manager

4879053 fifpro is in disagreement with the decision of fifas dispute resolution chamber condemning the romanian footballer adrian mutu to pay an amount of over 17 million euros as financial compensation to his former club chelsea after he was caught in a doping test in september 2004 for using cocaine for which reason he was dismissed
4879054 fifpro will assist mutu when the romanian player will lodge an appeal
4879055 when the same offence would have been committed by a player in possession of an english passport than this player wouldnt have had to pay any damages at this dismissal since the fa premier league rules do not provide this
4879056 for this reason this can be considered as discrimination based on nationality
4879057 it is extremely strange that a player who is dismissed by a club must pay damages based on the transfer amount previously paid for him whilst he has had no control whatsoever on the amount of this fee

4879065 the administrative case investigated by the vsmmc cannot be trusted even when the department of health doh is part of the investigating process but the problem with doh is that they channel the investigation through the administrators of the hospital and depend on its recommendations
4879066 based on the recommendations released by the vsmmcs fact finding committee we can see that their recommendations cannot be trusted because they want to cover up the whitewash committed to repair them for the next case they will have to face

4879222 but of course we do offer an independent monetary policy in this country and of course i think its all pretty simple when the official interest rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow its really that simple
4879223 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all to not follow the official cash rate down
4879224 we do live in a market economy and we do live in a democratic country where we respect the importance and the stability of both fiscal policy and monetary policy
4879225 so of course when the reserve acts independently to put rates up that does put a lot of pain on households ultimately on businesses and it also puts a bit of a handbrake on the economy
4879226 i grew up in the roswell area i was almost 17 and senior in high school when it happened family members were ranchers and cattle people we knew all the ranchers and towns people in the area including where the ufo impacted in spite of official denials and threats about talking the local lore told the story
4879227 after my space flight and being a local boy people involved not only the locals trusted me with their stories because they were getting older and wanted the truth out but were afraid to say it publicly so considered me a trustworthy source to carry their story onward been telling it all that way if anyone bothered to ask my opinion since the pentagon incident 11 years ago only now suddenly it got international media attention
4879228 i did take my story to the pentagon not nasa but the pentagon and asked for a meeting with the intelligence committee of the joint chiefs of staff and got it and told them my story and what i know and eventually had that confirmed by the admiral that i spoke with that indeed what i was saying was true

4879282 as an organization the aac ncdp has an opportunity to play a critical role in this historic election
4879283 we have a choice to either be an insignificant footnote or a momentous notation in the pages of north carolinas political and cultural history and if we are to make a positive impact on the 2008 election we must have an agenda the outlines clear comprehensive and effective objectives
4879284 well you know what african americans are not going to not get out and vote they will get out and vote for obama but you know what the main problem here is
4879285 white candidates have the problem because we aint going to vote for them because this is bull
4879286 the turmoil and backstabbing within the n c democratic partys african american caucus leaves me wondering if the caucus has perhaps outlived its usefulness
4879287 and for a person who says that he is the president of a democratic caucus to publicly declare that he will work to ensure that african americans in north carolina do not vote for white democratic nominees in november is racial politics at its worse and should be condemned by all reasonable thinking people
4879288 such reckless rhetoric jeopardizes the various coalitions weve established to help obama carry north carolina
4879289 as an african american voter in north carolina for the past 45 years and a member in good standing of the north carolina democratic partys state executive committee i am hereby appealing to the chairman and other party leaders to officially disband the caucus for due cause of a serious breach of its founding mission
4879290 at the moment i can not foresee any other resolution which would compel the african american caucus to be an asset going forward
4879291 i dont think that kind of talk on either side is helpful and the truth is they represent a tiny minority of democrats
4879292 most black democrats are not going to refuse to vote for white democrats and most democrats who supported hillary clinton are going to gladly vote for barack obama
4879293 we ought to focus on all those millions of people who really want to do the right thing for the country instead of those who want to divide us
4879294 there are some rumors floating around that the obama campaign is looking at the possibility of putting some gotv get out the vote money in north carolina and that theyre going to funnel the money through the state democratic partys african america caucus

4879484 any of the various procedures including the prescription and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
4879485 several months ago i became aware that certain medical specialty certification groups were adopting requirements which potentially violate a physicians right to choose whether he or she performs abortion i wrote to the organizations in question protesting their actions frankly i found their response to be dodgy and unsatisfying i sent another letter more of the same not only are there clear provisions in three separate laws protecting federally funded health care providers right of conscience but doing otherwise undermines the most fundamental moral underpinning of freedom of expression and action i asked that regulations be drafted which would enforce these long standing laws protecting a medical practitioners conscience rights an early draft of the regulations found its way into public circulation before it had reached my review it contained words that lead some to conclude my intent is to deal with the subject of contraceptives somehow defining them as abortion not true the bush administration has consistently supported the unborn however the issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers the department is still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
4879486 one thing i did find helpful was the clear explanation of the ideological basis of opposition to physician conscience mary jane gallagher president of the national family planning and reproductive health association was quoted in congressional quarterlys healthbeat saying
4879487 family planning providers work to provide family planning services so its really not acceptable to the people i represent that this administration is considering allowing doctors and nurses and pharmacists that have received their education to provide services to now be able to not provide those services if they dont want to
4879488 whos going to provide access to contraceptives services if the administration provides this large loophole to deny services
4879489 providers are given an oath now they get to pick and choose what they want to do if a regulation is issued she said

4879542 i felt like he was probably overall the most impressive quarterback today and think overall justin made up some ground
4879543 i think were a great football team if we dont beat ourselves there are very few teams out there that can beat us but today we bit ourselves enough times with negative plays bumbled snaps turnovers in the red zone where you need to be on your game we were not and thats frustrating and we have to come of age quickly as a quarterback i do think we have a pretty talented offensive group
4879544 i didnt think we were very sharp today i thought occasionally our defense did some really good things but i dont think the offense pressed them enough or pushed them hard enough we have a lot of work to do in every aspect offense defense and special teams our tempo is not where we want it to be and thats a function of some young quarterbacks that we feel pretty good about practice but when we put them in here autzen stadium with the noise and game atmosphere we did not execute as a football team we need to play faster thats across the board were a fairly young team but thats not an excuse at all thats something we have to outgrow in a hurry like in two weeks

4879590 60 per cent of those responses were negative if thats the case then the public has spoken and the practice should be discontinued
4879591 i want my councillors to have free access to the auditorium so that as prudent managers they can assess opportunities first hand
4879592 the encouragement is for us to be there to understand how the auditorium works and functions for a variety of events

4879601 what the day indeed the whole year should be about is not creating misery upon misery for our children and their children and their children and on and on for generations ultimately stopping climate change is not about preserving the earth or creation but about preserving ourselves yes we cant preserve ourselves if we dont preserve a livable climate and we cant preserve a livable climate if we dont preserve the earth but the focus needs to stay on the health and well being of billions of humans because ultimately humans are the ones who will experience the most prolonged suffering and if enough people come to see it that way we have a chance of avoiding the worst we have fiddled like nero for far too long to save the whole earth or all of its species now we need a world war ii scale effort just to cut our losses and save what matters most so lets call it triage day and if worst comes to worst at least future generations wont have to change the name again

4879634 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4879648 on the day of judgment we shall set up scales of justice so that no one will be dealt with unjustly in any way even if someone has an act as small as a grain of a mustard seed we will bring it to account and sufficient are we to settle the accounts
4879649 okay yahweh youre supposed to act like my husband cuz you said

4879654 heath just want to let you know that ive been drinking a lot of liquor and took a lot of pills with a little luck i wont wake up in the morning if you need me ill be in my bed room but i might not be here
4879655 there were many times i didnt pray for another day and i didnt pray for another hour i prayed for another minute to keep going
4879656 theres no doubt that my faith was strengthened and reinforced and tested because sometimes you have a tendency to say why am i here
4879657 we knew we had to have some belief greater than ourselves
4879658 we decided we needed to be all on the same sheet of music at least one time during the week
4879659 yea though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death we will fear no evil
4879660 we agreed that we were going to have a church service and told the vietnamese and they said no
4879661 the vietnamese broke in and seized the people who were standing against the wall doing the service
4879662 they marched them out of the room at gunpoint so i stood up and started singing the star spangled banner god bless america my country tis of thee and every song we could think of
4879663 we wanted to actually just have a chance to do what we felt was a fundamental human right and we got spiritual comfort from being able to worship together
4879664 we thought look if were going to be together then were going to stand up theyd done so many bad things that we werent nearly as afraid of them as maybe we would have been if a lot of us hadnt gone through what wed gone through
4879665 render unto caesar what is caesars and render unto god what is gods
4879666 what i was trying to tell my fellow prisoners is that we were doing caesars work when we got into prison so we should ask for gods help to do the right thing and for us to get out of prison if it be gods will for us to do so
4879667 the god we had come to know wasnt going to wave a magic wand and poof we would all be free the god we knew would give us the strength to endure what we had to do and it was up to us to take that strength and knowledge and do what we had to do
4879668 i recall it as if it happened an hour ago
4879669 it was cold the guards were looking through the windows at us the room was dimly lit because of the light bulbs that were in each corner these guys had beautiful voices im telling you one was a bass one was a tenor it was one of the most beautiful experiences i ever had
4879670 it was because they were so happy to be able to celebrate christmas with fellow americans
4879671 a doctor at tskhinvali regional hospital who was on duty from the afternoon of august 7 told human rights watch that between august 6 to 12 the hospital treated 273 wounded both military and civilians the doctor also said that 44 bodies had been brought to the hospital since the fighting began of both military and civilians the figure reflects only those killed in the city of tskhinvali but the doctor was adamant that the majority of people killed in the city had been brought to the hospital before being buried because the city morgue was not functioning due to the lack of electricity in the city

4879681 you mightve walked the ten steps to the car to help
4879682 i thought id make us up a little after church snack before we start
4879683 you still got any of that bacon viva brought over
4879684 you wouldnt know it but i turned that cooler up when we got back
4879685 maybe some eggs potatoes and a slice or two of that good thick bacon
4879686 i was thinkin we could put it in the au gratin for tonight
4879687 i was thinkin that maybe we didnt need to bring the au gratin were bringing fried chicken slaw and mississippi mud pie
4879688 id just hate to go hungry and you know how these new church members whose names i shall not mention lord for fear of bein hateful have a way of comin in empty handed not that that keeps them from fillin their plates mind you
4879689 we could always have another little snack before we go
4879690 well arent you just a chubby little heifer i swear
4879691 it just seems a shame to have to eat before we go because some people dont have time to share with the rest of us some people are just too important with their important jobs and their precious little families like we dont have anything important to do
4879692 piggin she did not come in empty handed and you know it
4879693 you are entirely too sensitive piggin lord knows the church is not what it used to be but we must be charitable
4879694 fish wrapped in seaweed thats what it was i dont care where it comes from i wouldnt feed that to my dog

4879711 now this is more like it shes even got the marshmallows arranged into a cross now that took preparation
4879712 bettern last month takin a bite out of jesus head unnerved me
4879713 well look who it is heifer over there by the doorway

4879731 the united states is due to close down its arabic speaking space channel alhurra after the white house realized that this space channel did not fulfil the goal sought from the space channel consequently the 350 million which the us administration spent on alhurra since february 2004 did not produce any results director of the washington office of al arabiya space channel hisham milhim said that despite this high cost the alhurra failed to rank even the fourth space channel for the viewers of the arab space channels he added seldom would you find people who watch alhurra
4879732 as of august 1 eutelsat has had a free transponder facing asia and is contract bound to resume the ntdtv transmission immediately said jan jekielek international society for human rights ishr representative in poland and also a staff member of the epoch times who organized the event eutelsat in an august 13 letter to ishr from deputy ceo jean paul brillaud reiterated its position that a technical malfunction on w5 prevents the company from resuming ntdtvs signal however on july 31 eutelsat ended its contract with the broadcasting board governors bbg the independent federal agency responsible for all u s government backed international civilian broadcasting opening up another w5 transponder over asia the epoch times has learned ton van anh vietnamese radio free asia correspondent also spoke at the event people in many asian countries have to be very discreet to receive independent broadcasts and even then they are often jammed observed van an anh adding that now they also have to worry about corporations such as eutelsat blocking signals
4879733 the manager and the finance person has been let go and there is nothing i can do
4879734 what is dominated how about a body accelerating due to gravity towards another body there is obviously positive feedback there for some reason you cannot grasp this simple fact
4879735 how about a body accelerating due to gravity towards another body there is obviously positive feedback there
4879736 if you believe in god and you turn out to be right pascal argued the payoff is
4879737 krugmans thinking is similarly binary either global warming is true and the stakes are enormous or it isnt and they are trivial but how do we know that global warming wont turn out to be beneficial or that efforts to avert it wont have catastrophic consequences
4879738 one difference between pascals wager and krugmans is that whereas pascal was making a case for individuals to embrace faith krugman is arguing for collective action which is to say he wishes to use the power of government to impose his beliefs on others
4879739 the rest of your post barely makes sense eskimo what
4879740 i am hugely amused that people cannot even perceive the positive feedback inherent in gravity
4879741 so we should base energy policy on 33 years of temperature data
4879742 youre also too stupid to understand what ad hominem actually means
4879743 its hard to tell what made you laugh like a twat but i can tell you that
4879744 i am og i like to look at illegal pornography whenever possible i dont know any science whatsoever
4879745 there you go og you said it no matter what you say from now on ill simply refer you to the post where you said i dont know any science whatsoever
4879746 im still waiting for him to post his credentials like some many of his debate partners have been willing to do
4879747 as a comet moves away from the sun the gravitational force on it weakens and so it moves away faster than it would in a uniform gravitational field positive feedback again
4879748 scientist i think you just fell for a troll post this is not the real og you have been sparring with
4879749 wow you really are unbelievably thick i made it spectacularly obvious that i was posting as og to demonstrate how pathetically idiotic og was for attributing to me a false post made under my name now youve topped even ogs idiocy seriously how old are you you write like a backward 12 year old and you obviously have significant comprehension problems
4879750 good spot tommy especially since the real og links his identity to a url thereby allowing us to attach a direct reference point to him somehow i think scientist may have decide to post as og but ignored that little factoid hard to believe considering how anal he is about html links but then he only refers to those when he wishes to belittle others im still waiting for him to post his credentials like some many of his debate partners have been willing to do
4879751 peter read this statement carefully it moves away faster than it would in a uniform gravitational field as you are intellectually challenged i guess i have to say explicitly that nowhere in that statement is there anything which suggests that a comet is accelerating now how about thinking before you post next time
4879752 ha ha ha that is a magnificently lame attempt to dig yourself out of a hole ironic of course it was of course
4879753 as i said before the post youre referring to was not written by me ill demonstrate how stupid you look by insisting that it was me in my next two posts posted by scientist august 07 2008 at 02 42 am
4879754 actually i thought it scientist who wrote that b s but decided to play it up and expose his now predicable reply he had posted 2 times in a minute
4879755 long ago in many times and many ways god spoke to our fathers by the prophets
4879756 but in these last days he has spoken to us by his son
4879757 i have not come to bring peace but a sword
4879758 would it be all right if we just sat and the musician and i finally rented shine a light the scorcese rolling stones film and we were impressed that we stayed interested almost until the end
4879759 i could actually understand the lyrics keith richards was singing
4879760 right now we have an opportunity to see climate change in a different light to see it for what it is a human rights issue on a dangerous collision course of race and class
4879761 while its an issue that affects all of us like many other social justice issues it is disproportionately affecting african americans other people of color low income people and indigenous communities
4879762 overall death rates are higher in winter than in summer and it is possible that milder winters could reduce deaths in winter months however the relationship between winter weather and mortality is difficult to interpret
4879763 studies have shown that higher summer temperatures mean more heat deaths but that higher winter temperatures do not necessarily reduce cold deaths
4879764 observed changes in the heaviest 5 percent of precipitation events
4879765 if you cant dazzle them with brilliance baffle them with bs
4879766 scientist likes to molest chickens in his spare time and is really a closet 911 troofer

4879768 actually brendan you cant publish that unless you can prove it
4879769 actually brendan you cant publish that unless you can prove it
4879770 but suffice to say in the vast majority of points you try to make you are wrong
4879771 our reanalysis of the data shows a dramatic increase of 09mm 006mm per year in the last fifteen years over the expected level
4879772 why do deniers find it impossible to grasp the idea that you cannot say anything about trends in climate change based on ten years of data
4879773 a combination of these two forces led to what we observe now and we should not ignore either forces
4879774 there have been numerous models run that have looked at that and basically they cant reproduce the ice loss weve had with natural variability
4879775 you have to add a carbon dioxide warming component to it
4879776 physically it is impossible to add co2 to the atmosphere without making it hotter
4879777 another issue troubling arctic scientists is the degradation of climate data from the arctic region including closures of some hydrometeorological stations and reductions of other climate networks in canada and russia
4879778 the earth may be in the midst of a planet wide warming cycle but in a startling departure from global trends scientists have found that temperatures on the antarctic continent have fallen steadily for more than two decades
4879779 scripps institution of oceanography at uc san diego atmospheric scientist v ramanathan and university of iowa chemical engineer greg carmichael said that soot and other forms of black carbon could have as much as 60 percent of the current global warming effect of carbon dioxide
4879780 were actually projecting this year that the north pole may be free of ice for the first time in history
4879781 but we didnt say for sure the temperature would be half a degree warmer
4879782 and saying theres a 50 50 chance is hardly a bold prediction
4879783 2 you and daniel both suffer from the classic climate idiot belief that you can measure climate change over six years you cant
4879784 if i say that lewis hamilton has a 50 50 chance of winning the european grand prix and he doesnt was i right or was i wrong
4879785 over the next 10 years there is a 50 probability that the arctic ice will melt completely in any particular summer
4879786 were actually projecting this year that the north pole may be free of ice for the first time in history
4879787 things that dont support the consensus occasionally slip through the cracks
4879788 focuses on whether a study has some minimum level of rigor and coherence and whether it offers up findings that are new or somehow advance the ball on an important topic
4879789 in the last sentence of my commment above refers to the non scientist
4879790 the millions of man hours that went into all that worldwide research have proved worthless in the pursuit of human progress the main reason for this failure was the formulation of an establishment orthodoxy that prevented the publication of alternatives
4879791 why bother if youre just going to look for mistakes
4879792 or you all come to grips or nothing will happen
4879793 empirical corrections that could not be justified on physical principles
4879794 aerosols are short lived and cover a very limited area of the globe if they cover say only 10 of the globe then their cooling effect must be 1c in their area of effect to have even a small 0 1c global average effect you ever heard of pinatubo do you know what happened to global temperatures after it erupted do you know what this says about the lifetime and cooling effect of aerosols ill give you a clue your beliefs about them are not even remotely close to the truth
4879795 this pattern of tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling is consistent with our understanding of how atmospheric temperature should be changing in response to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations
4879796 if they cover say only 10 of the globe then their cooling effect must be 1c in their area of effect to have even a small 0 1c global average effect
4879797 it takes more than ten years of a temperature trend
4879798 on intrinsic errors in turbulence models based on reynolds averaged navier stokes equations
4879799 your question doesnt seem to make sense the enhanced greenhouse effect if you wish to call it that has been detected it is the reason for the dramatic warming since 1975
4879800 we can put a man on the moon but we cant solve fill in your social problem
4879801 in the real world one cannot understand complex systems in terms of childish either or questions like this the question is how long one needs to discern the influence of a forcing among the unforced variations inherent in the climate system adding 2ppm of co2 to the atmosphere each year increases temperatures by about 0 2 c decade
4879802 do you understand tha co2 is not the only thing which affects the climate
4879803 it seems to me that hind casting or back casting is a lot like a clairvoyant telling you what happened yesterday
4879804 the greenhouse warming should be clearly identifiable in the 1990s

4879809 i am honored and humbled to stand here where so many of americas leaders have come before me and so many will follow we have a place all of us in a long story a story we continue but whose end we will not see it is a story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old a story of a slave holding society that became a servant of freedom the story of a power that went into the world to protect but not possess to defend but not to conquer it is the american story a story of flawed and fallible people united across the generations by grand and enduring ideals the grandest of these ideals is an unfolding american promise that everyone belongs that everyone deserves a chance that no insignificant person was ever born americans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws and though our nation has sometimes halted and sometimes delayed we must follow no other course
4879810 today i also speak anew to my fellow citizens from all of you i have asked patience in the hard task of securing america which you have granted in good measure
4879811 as it gets closer does the force of gravity on it increase or decrease does this make it fall faster or slower is this natural process dominated by positive or negative feedback
4879812 there are various other forces at work here that i can think of in this scenario but they are all negative feedback
4879813 the climate has changed quickly enough to trigger mass extinctions
4879814 og its hard to tell what made you laugh like a twat but i can tell you that
4879815 this is a hobby article not a peer reviewed paper
4879816 in a system oscillating between two states there is no physically meaningful mean that is being reverted to
4879817 ps another wonderful slice of ignorance frequently throughout earths history the climate has changed quickly enough to trigger mass extinctions

4879822 more than half 55 6 of the displaced jobs were in the top half of american wage earners growing china trade deficits contributed to the loss of 200 000 scientist and engineering jobs within the manufacturing sector a 10 7 drop
4879823 this new data is a wake up call about the devastating effect of our unbalanced china trade on american jobs wages and our economy
4879824 the damage is being felt in every state and as the trade deficit continues to grow and china moves into higher wage sectors the trend lines on the future loss of jobs and depression of incomes are especially alarming
4879825 china is rapidly diversifying its export base and expanding into higher value added commodities such as computer and electronic products aircraft and auto parts and machinery
4879826 chinas manipulation of its currency makes the yuan artificially cheap effectively subsidizing exports beijings suppression of labor rights lowers wages china subsidizes some key industries and maintains barriers to some imports we must demand a fundamental change in exchange rate policies and labor standards in the chinese economy as a critical first step toward restoring a level playing field where american workers can compete fairly

4879828 sometimes you go to war with the media you have not the media you wish you had
4879829 because hes the hero gotham deserves but not the one it needs right now so well hunt him because he can take it because hes not the hero hes a silent guardian watchful protector the dark knight
4879830 things will start to get worse before it gets better
4879831 as we looked through the comics there was this fascinating idea that batmans presence in gotham actually attracts criminals to gotham attracts lunacy
4879832 when youre dealing with questionable notions like people taking the law into their own hands you have to really ask where does that lead thats what makes the character so dark because he expresses a vengeful desire
4879833 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
4879834 this seems to be a movie that extols some of the conservative viewpoints that we are dealing with terrorists that you can trust people to make the right decision that sometimes you have to do things that you dont want to do and you have to cross lines that you dont want to cross if youre going to save if youre going to save your city in this case its gotham
4879835 but batman goes into another country and with a c130 snatches a guy out then throws him back here into gotham so theres rendition at one point the morgan freeman character says to batman wait a minute hang on youre eavesdropping on everyone in gotham and batman says yes to stop this terrorist morgan freeman says i cant be a part of it and yet morgan freeman does become a part of it and they find the joker one of the ways they find the joker is through eavesdropping i mean the parallels here of whats going on is to me stunning
4879836 good news of a great joy that will be for all the people
4879837 just close it forget about it charity starts at home and our people need the jobs more than the chinese and the koreans

4879844 the cold passed reluctantly from the earth and the retiring fogs revealed an army stretched out on the hills resting as the landscape changed from brown to green the army awakened and began to tremble with eagerness at the noise of rumors it cast its eyes upon the roads which were growing from long troughs of liquid mud to proper thoroughfares a river amber tinted in the shadow of its banks purled at the armys feet and at night when the stream had become of a sorrowful blackness one could see across it the red eye like gleam of hostile camp fires set in the low brows of distant hills
4879845 some folks have the old helmets and they dont look as good we got some shoulder pads that could be better
4879846 we need helmets we need shoulder pads we need more footballs just a laundry list of things that we desire that i guess i see as a need and others may see as a want
4879847 we dont have to depend on other people to just give us what we need we can be out here raising money for ourselves to be able to go out and buy new equipment new helmets new balls better ourselves better the program in general
4879848 it makes a difference it makes a difference at each level being able to have on nice things and i feel like our student athletes regardless of their social economic status they deserve the best
4879849 a lot of our coaches say the pads dont make the player the player makes the pads so were going to play the best we can in what weve got but it definitely is a plus if you can look better in better equipment
4879850 you just get to see all the new kinds of games that are coming out meet up with a lot of old friends that you dont get to see from around the country
4879851 every year im absolutely amazed by the turnout of people and their absolute love of gaming
4879852 im the one whose interested in board games and i didnt want to leave my wife and child at home so im trying to get my wife into the gaming and stuff so she plays with me and things like that
4879853 you can walk into the connected hotels circle center sidewalks in between and there are gonna be pickup games going on and so they really take over our downtown thats what were designed for
4879854 when classes open august 25 in harrold school buildings will be safer than normal thanks to this decision
4879855 critics of the plan will argue about liability or suggest that the school could have hired a security officer or off duty policeman but we all know that such officers cant be everywhere and in an emergency every second counts
4879856 gun control extremists despise this kind of common sense approach to the potential of school violence
4879857 but the time has come to challenge their head in the sand philosophy how many lives have been lost on public school and college campuses because of these insane victim disarmament measures how many students and teachers might be alive today if only lawmakers and school officials had acted as responsibly as the harrold administration
4879858 allowing armed staff and teachers will provide a last line of defense if other security measures at the school fail
4879859 no doubt the school board and mr thweatt will suffer some slings and arrows but if this decision one day saves the life of even one child it will have been worthwhile
4879860 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog

4879900 if we were really committed to the pursuit of what matters we might well be served to hold a moratorium on the question how if we could agree that for six months we would not ask how something in our lives might shift for the better it would refocus our attention on deciding what is the right question rather than what is the right answer it would force us to act as if we already knew how we just have to figure out what is worth doing

4879927 el gobierno considera estupendo que los ni os se eduquen de acuerdo con sus religiones tradicionales pero yo llamo a esto lavado de cerebro parece que a los profesores les da miedo que los tachen de racistas
4879928 es pr cticamente imposible decir nada contra el islam en este pa s porque si uno lo hace se ve inmediatamente acusado de racista o de fobia antiisl mica
4879929 me asustaron las barreras que encontr al aprendizaje yo les mostraba las pruebas a favor de la teor a de la evoluci n pero los muchachos me respond an que no era eso lo que ense aba el libro sagrado
4879930 creo que nos ense an a respetar demasiado la religi n frente a otro tipo de opiniones
4879931 no basta con decir que se trata de dos teor as una llamada evoluci n y la otra g nesis

4879933 1 amados esta es la segunda carta que os escribo y en ambas despierto con exhortaci n vuestro limpio entendimiento 2 para que teng is memoria de las palabras que antes han sido dichas por los santos profetas y del mandamiento del se or y salvador dado por vuestros ap stoles 3 sabiendo primero esto que en los postreros d as vendr n burladores andando seg n sus propias concupiscencias a 4 y diciendo d nde est la promesa de su advenimiento porque desde el d a en que los padres durmieron todas las cosas permanecen as como desde el principio de la creaci n 5 estos ignoran voluntariamente que en el tiempo antiguo fueron hechos por la palabra de dios los cielos y tambi n la tierra que proviene del agua y por el agua subsiste b 6 por lo cual el mundo de entonces pereci anegado en agua c 7 pero los cielos y la tierra que existen ahora est n reservados por la misma palabra guardados para el fuego en el d a del juicio y de la perdici n de los hombres imp os

4879936 sobre el origen de las especies mediante la selecci n natural
4879937 pruebas de que la teor a de la evoluci n es cierta en el sentido riguroso de una verificaci n o demostraci n experimental cient fica es imposible por varias razones
4879938 debemos primeramente preguntarnos si la teor a de la evoluci n por medio de la selecci n natural es cient fica o pseudo cient fica metaf sica considerando la primera parte de la teor a que postula que la evoluci n ha ocurrido sugiere que la historia de la vida es un solo proceso de divisi n y progresi n de especies
4879939 en la atm sfera y en los varios lagos acu ticos de la tierra primitiva la existencia de interacciones destructivas la presencia de oxigeno en la atm sfera hubieran disminuido considerablemente de no haber consumido completamente los qu micos precursores esenciales para la vida y por consiguiente las tasas de evoluci n qu mica hubieran sido insignificante

4879941 darwin estaba avergonzado del testamento de los f siles de su poca ahora cerca de 120 a os despu s el conocimiento sobre los f siles se ha expandido enormemente
4879942 la ausencia de f siles que den evidencia de las etapas intermediarias entre las transiciones mayores en el dise o org nico y en realidad nuestra inhabilidad aun en nuestra imaginaci n de construir f siles intermediarios funcionales en muchos casos ha sido un problema persistente y pedante para las explicaciones graduales de la evoluci n
4879943 la extrema ausencia de formas transitivas en los f siles persiste en ser un secreto de la paleontolog a
4879944 sin formas transitivas o intermediarias que puedan conectar las brechas enormes que separan a las especies y grupos de organismos actuales el concepto de evoluci n nunca podria tomarse en serio como una hip tesis cient fica
4879945 el problema de la biolog a es el de encontrar un origen simple la tendencia es imaginar que hubo un tiempo cuando solo c lulas simples existieron pero no c lulas complejas esta creencia ha resultado equivocada viajando en retroceso hacia la era de las rocas m s antiguas los f siles de las formas de vida ancestrales no revelan un origen simple

4879947 como m nimo se pueden identificar dos tipos de ojos diferentes en los trilobitos el ojo compuesto holocroal consiste en lentes hexagonales contiguos de calcita en n meros entre 100 y 15 mil
4879948 todav a es muy cierto tal como lo era en los tiempos de darwin que los primeros representantes de todas las clases mas importantes de organismos conocidos por la biolog a siguen siendo muy caracter sticos de sus clases cuando hacen su aparici n inicial en el testamento fosil tico los moluscos por ejemplo ya son todos altamente diferenciados cuando aparecen en los f siles los estratos depositados durante cientos de millones de a os antes del periodo c mbrico los cuales podr an haber contenido los eslabones que conectar an a las familias principales est n casi completamente vac os de f siles de animales la historia es la misma para las plantas
4879949 la vida no pudo haber tenido un origen aleatorio el problema es que hay cerca de 2000 enzimas y la probabilidad de obtenerlas todas en un momento dado es igual a 10 elevado a la potencia de 40 mil una probabilidad tan baja que aun si el universo entero consistiera de caldo pre bi tico seria pr cticamente imposible que este evento sucediera espont neamente
4879950 los bloques de construcci n no forman prote nas espont neamente por lo menos no en forma aleatoria
4879951 un persona honesta equipada con el conocimiento disponible hoy en d a solo podr a decir que de alguna manera el origen de la vida parece ser en estos momentos casi un milagro son muy numerosas las condiciones que tuvieron que existir para sustentar tal origen
4879952 la idea intuitiva de que eventos puramente aleatorios nunca pudieron dar lugar al grado de complejidad e ingeniosidad tan com n y persistente en la naturaleza ha sido un foco continuo de escepticismo desde que se public el libro
4879953 nadie ha producido jam s una nueva especie mediante el mecanismo de selecci n natural
4879954 la selecci n natural no conlleva a la creaci n de nuevas especies
4879955 no hay ni una sola instancia en la que se pueda decir que los mutantes estudiados tienen una viabilidad mayor que la de las especies maternas
4879956 la evoluci n de las aves es mas compleja que lo que implican las discusiones precedentes
4879957 la oportuna aparici n de mutaciones que permitieron a los animales y plantas suplir sus necesidades es muy dif cil de creer

4879966 la investigaci n antropol gica ha indicado que hoy entre la gente primitiva m s lejana y remota hay una creencia universal en dios y en las historias y leyendas m s tempranas de las personas alrededor del mundo el concepto original era de un dios quien era el creador un alto dios original parece haber estado en su conciencia aun en aquellas sociedades que hoy son polite stas
