4410029 they were a couple before she went to las vegas then she decides to get married on a whim comes back and rings up faris as if what she has done is the most normal thing in the world
4410030 she lives in a bubble and is loving all the attention but shes a married woman now and needs to grow up
4410031 faris knew peaches was going to the us for work but that was it he feels hes been made a laughing stock during all of this and is only now getting to the bottom of what happened

4410033 i am so glad these guys are so humble thats why they make a great addition to the film it will be bittersweet seeing this movie knowing he was filming it only days before he died this picture still hurts to see because as we all know he did die a couple of days after this picture was taken my thoughts will always be with heath

4410042 i got an e mail from a lady that lives on the west end of alabama drive talking about how scared she was how afraid she was to go out at night or to go out during the daytime because of the men just hanging out people shouldnt have to live like that

4410044 the new software bluecoat offers the opportunity to improve the control of access to web sites by producing reports on usage and by allowing more sophisticated access control such as by time of day this allows the council to place more of the responsibility of monitoring the use of the internet on individual service managers and there is a project in place to achieve this the city council does not block sites for containing material on atheism agnosticism secularism wicca witchcraft the occult or any similar subjects it never has done and no proposal has been made that it should

4410057 this barmy window that weve got it forces you to either put the club at risk financially or put it at risk football wise if youre not one of the big four clubs
4410058 were not and we try to do our best in every aspect without putting the club at risk we havent got the resources of some of the huge premier league clubs

4410076 the reality is that enterprises are not frustrated with tape many of its inherent challenges have been addressed through more intelligent automated tape library systems
4410077 they cannot back up all the critical corporate data they need to with tape alone because there is more data to back up than ever before there is less planned downtime during which to complete backups and application owners want more frequent backups and faster restores
4410078 in a society where you cannot even buy cassette tapes any more as they are unreliable and known for getting chewed up in machines why are businesses still using tapes to back up their data
4410079 automated online backup means there is no need to physically move the data offsite which the business is charged to have removed and to bring back
4410080 smartways service provides a repeated revenue stream for its partners which can continually buy more storage when needed
4410081 partners buy aggregated storage from us which they can then distribute to each customer this means they do not have to keep coming to us for more space all the time and they can close deals faster
4410082 there is an attachment with tape which is why it will never die
4410083 it is selling more tapes than it has in a while and therefore is investing in developments around tape
4410084 switching to online backup means that the data does not have to be physically moved however it disregards the telecommunication charge it costs companies to virtually transport the data as with anything in it it is a trade off
4410085 tape still has its place even though other technologies are becoming more prevalent
4410086 the role of tape is changing and companies are increasingly looking to take advantage of the newer disk based technologies such as virtual tape libraries vtl and de duplication
4410087 tape being dead has to be one of the most commonly heard untruths in the market there are always claims that new technologies will eliminate tape from the it market and frankly this is not the case
4410088 tapes will not go away because there is always the need for retention but 2008 is the year for de duplication
4410089 all the industrys gorillas are investing in this technology emc partnered with quantum ibm acquired diligent technologies and sepaton has an oem agreement with hp
4410090 it will be slightly different but they the rmt have got their views we feel there needs to be that role
4410091 europe becomes more and more a province of islam a colony of islam

4410097 the goal of this research was to build on existing work in the field in which 2d metamaterials have been created
4410098 we were able to take the next step towards practical cloaking by constructing three dimensional metamaterials exhibiting negative refraction
4410099 for light ranging from 1200 1700 nm both the permittivity and permeability are negative leading to a negative index of refraction
4410100 this leads to negative phase propagation in the material and negative refraction at the interface
4410101 reducing loss in metamaterials has been a challenge in the field since its inception and is a key issue for real world applications and devices
4410102 in the work published in nature we were able to construct low loss three dimensional metamaterials and we found that making the material thicker actually reduces the intrinsic loss
4410103 the material properties would first need slight engineering before it could be wrapped around an object to cloak it
4410104 the next step is to realize an application such as high resolution imaging in which materials exhibiting negative refraction can be used to image objects below the diffraction limit

4410109 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4410110 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4410111 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

4410119 big increases in energy are having a substantial impact on plastics firms who are already hit by the high oil price through their raw materials
4410120 energy suppliers should extend the same consideration that they do to domestic customers which they are obliged to do by law

4410137 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4410138 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4410139 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4410140 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4410141 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

4410144 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 y la declaraci n de las naciones unidas esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas

4410156 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4410157 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4410158 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4410159 aus dieser konstellation resultiert jetzt ein gewisser eindeckungsbedarf bei henkel
4410160 das geld das jetzt wieder in die finanzwerte flie t kommt aus den papieren aus als eher defensiv geltenden branchen

4410163 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4410164 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4410165 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso

4410177 i dont know where theyll go with it really ive even heard that theyre going to put new songs in i wrote the book the music and the lyrics where are they going to get the songs from whos going to do that thats a bit strange isnt it
4410178 this was clearly a very ugly incident and is completely in contradiction to the assurances that the chinese made about media freedom during the olympics
4410179 in light of the tools available to allow viewers to choose what cable speech to hear and not here the government cannot possibly establish that content based restrictions on such speech pass first amendment muster
4410180 as many of you may know from experience when you are married for a long time and it ends
4410181 i felt unattractive short and self conscious about my body and i would purposely emphasize that by doing odd things
4410182 i wore glasses braces odd hairdos and dumpy clothes i was clumsy and awkward when i was a freshman i wore a christmas tree skirt as a cape i couldnt get any dates until senior year
4410183 and for us having this album finally hit stores and having the fans sing the songs knowing that they can actually hear them and have it in
4410184 david is going to be in the surprise finale they always have a segment to do the handover to showcase the next city to host the olympics
4410185 he was very involved in the london bid to get it and as a londoner he is incredibly proud that the olympics will be in london
4410186 he is the single greatest olympic athlete of all time now
4410187 he will probably be the single greatest athlete compared to anybody in any century the 20th the 21st century and whatever
4410188 and you know they say you judge a persons character by the company they keep and im glad
4410189 and then i said oh man i think its alanis
4410190 this statement is to say that after so much speculation and comments the actors are indeed expecting a baby at the start of next year
4410191 what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
4410192 it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach
4410193 planet earth the documentary is pretty much all ive been watching
4410194 when your life is going too fast off the train tracks i can slow it down
4410195 being able to express myself and my journey through my music is a feeling i cant describe
4410196 im feeling very tired the first time around i could put my feet up and relax this time i have a baby to run after and carry
4410197 shed probably like to hear a lot of fun stuff like new kids on the block or bell biv devoe or something like that
4410198 he has great morals and ethics and i think his baby will be brought up in love
4410199 my grandmothers birthday god rest her soul was august 8

4410202 her understanding of how big budget british films get financed out of hollywood is extensive and unique
4410203 barbara will be an enormous asset for the u k film council in our efforts to attract inward investment into the u k film production sector
4410204 its true that i spent some time regularly taking part in sessions with a psychiatrist
4410205 by the way i find it to be very normal to lie on a couch every once in a while and to let your head be straightened out and your heart
4410206 i am not selling anything the items currently listed on ebay are things i had given away some time ago
4410207 wagner was ready to kill beatty he describes hanging around his house with a gun hoping he would walk out so he could take a shot
4410208 wracked with despair wagner started drinking heavily and considered suicide he wondered if he couldnt kill beatty maybe he should kill himself but an old friend pulled him out of his desolation and got him into analysis
4410209 i may not be able to do the 40th thirty years is pretty good and the show is still very popular
4410210 i usually go about ignoring such things but when someone says as has often been incorrectly alleged id abuse a romantic attachment as a publicity stunt or to promote a new movie of mine thats really just way below the belt
4410211 to love and be loved is the most beautiful thing that can happen to a person and ones own life is much more important than all the glamour and fame in the world
4410212 this story about jolie taking over is completely false this started with an inaccurate report months ago that said cruise was taking the role
4410213 they courted him for almost a year for this movie he considered it but passed
4410214 the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale
4410215 on the advice of the cps we shall be taking no further action we will not be commenting further

4410217 listen i was an ordinary fella you know but in those days you only paid two dollars for the whorehouses but first of all wed go get a bowl of chinese you know shrimp shrimp and fried rice that was my favourite
4410218 its one of those things that men have to do and uh and in those days i wasnt responsible to anybody except myself and to the navy of course
4410219 this is an unprecedented opportunity for a community that is underrepresented on television
4410220 we applaud tyra banks and tv network the cw for making this historic visibility of transgender people possible
4410221 zeta had been unwell for a short while and unfortunately had to miss a family birthday party recently
4410222 the family have been hit very hard by it because she was so loved by them all
4410223 jennifers friends think matt planted this false story to get press for himself hes apparently done this kind of thing before
4410224 shes hired some pretty high powered consultants to advise her and put it all together the website will be a registry like for a bridal or shower registry where low income women list things they need for their babies more well off people will then go on and buy stuff for the children
4410225 growing up i felt unattractive short and self conscious about my body and i would purposely emphasise that by doing odd things
4410226 i wore glasses braces odd hairdos and dumpy clothes when i was a freshman i wore a christmas tree skirt as a cape i couldnt get any dates until senior year
4410227 the fighting within our union is weakening us at the bargaining table we obviously need to chart a new course

4410229 before the coup someone from the kings cabinet had given me a shirt bearing the kings emblem if youre wearing that emblem youre 100 per cent safe
4410230 so when the coup went down i knew it was time to put on that shirt it was like a cloak of invincibility
4410231 the show takes place in new york city at a swanky hotel
4410232 i will be playing a guest checking into the hotel and i am going to film my scenes sometime next week i think jerry oconnell is hysterical have you guys seen his video on that web site funnyordie and i cant wait to meet niecy
4410233 i have no view on whether it should be remade but it doesnt have my blessing
4410234 im not co producing it and i wont be involved in any way the first i heard about it was when people sent me cuttings from u s papers
4410235 weve started conversations about it and i think in the next 30 or 60 days well be able to talk completely about that
4410236 before michelle leaves the house with matilda she has a bodyguard go around her block and make sure there are no photographers
4410237 this statement is to say that after so much speculation and comments the actors dolores fonzi and gael garcia bernal are indeed expecting a baby at the start of next year
4410238 ive truly relished working with my longtime partner tom cruise to revitalise united artists and i am proud of all that weve accomplished in the past two years reinvigorating the brand and developing such a strong slate of films
4410239 were going to have to move after were done filming the hills news season

4410242 i always try to talk my way out of kissing scenes do they really need to kiss in this part
4410243 ricardo chavira hates kissing me we are both not really fond of the kissing scenes
4410244 theyre still the best of friends but any romantic spark has well and truly gone its really sad but theres no one else involved
4410245 shes glad she got back together with him to give things another go she was desperate to save their relationship but at the end of the day it just wasnt to be
4410246 theyre both comfortable with the situation and kelly seems to be quite looking forward to being a single girl again
4410247 you cant understand how a woman seeing a man who has been separated from his wife for months can cause such a scandal
4410248 its awful i cant tell you you wonder when its all going to stop
4410249 thank goodness some people are seeing the hypocrisy of it all i know it makes sienna pleased to read these things it means a lot to her when theres so much negativity and criticism around
4410250 i just had to share something that came up today and it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach so heres the visual two paparazzi come up out of nowhere like usual and start throwing questions at me one of them being hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants wow
4410251 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a paedophile
4410252 i was caught out of nowhere so i didnt really come up with the proper response at the time theres many other things that i felt like saying but why give it to a random guy with a camera so that he can make money
4410253 all i am trying to say is is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4410254 i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye
4410255 madonna has not made an attempt to adopt this baby earlier this year or now
4410256 we went out one night in oviedo and we ran into this bronze sculpture of woody they love him we took pictures with the sculpture hugging it and gave the photos to woody
4410257 its such a privilege to serve as president of this academy its a dynamic time for our organisation and our art form im incredibly proud to be part of it
4410258 katherine is incredibly talented and were grateful for her work in creating army wives we are very happy to have had the opportunity to work with her
4410259 the matter is still pending before the arbitrator and subject to a confidentiality agreement
4410260 we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of
4410261 we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tentpole release for midsummer
4410262 summer season is an ideal window for a family tentpole release
4410263 but thats about all exhibition can expect to make up
4410264 our updated outlook reflects negative advertising trends and the recent downward revision to ubss 2009 u s gdp growth forecast
4410265 advertising growth has historically been highly correlated to gdp growth
4410266 you can think about american idol in terms of the process
4410267 everyone will get a chance to participate and vote it is a filtered collaboration so that we will have the best possible work at the end
4410268 this is a great opportunity to bring together computer graphics with the creativity of both hollywood and the facebook community
4410269 intel processor performance and facebook sharing and communication tools enable large numbers of people around the globe to collaborate on a single creative endeavor
4410270 if we manage to tell a good story and introduce compelling characters through this lets see if we can do for instance a feature length project
4410271 if it is also a good user experience then i think we will do a bunch of things this way
4410272 puts it on track to its most successful year in history
4410273 if abc and disney refuse to repudiate the contents of the davine memo then producers in both the u
4410274 between format rights fees and executive producer fees there are significant costs added to your production budget that will impact what you can put on the screen a large chunk of the back end will go to the rights holder
4410275 the olympics have completely captivated the american public and further ignited our sales efforts
4410276 americans are consuming our olympic coverage in record numbers and in every way
4410277 it speaks to a cultural phenomenon that is happening right now in music
4410278 and so here we are negotiating on our own with diminished leverage against a united front of media conglomerates
4410279 is this what we want for our future if this leadership stays in place the bad relations with aftra will persist and well continue to negotiate contracts from a position of division and weakness
4410280 were always appreciative of our higher level members getting involved
4410281 its just disappointing that these individuals would rather the guild accept a bad deal then hold firm on a deal that could possibly benefit middle class actors
4410282 had we taken the amptps offer we would be unfortunately stuck with issues that we probably could not revisit especially in the area of residuals for product made for new media were not satisfied with a proposal that denies performers residuals in an area that we basically know will take over as tv
4410283 you should be assured that any communication using sag e mail lists does not reflect an endorsement of any candidate or slate of candidates
4410284 there is at least one more chapter we ultimately want to see the characters make it back to new york
4410285 we love bernie he made an amazing contribution to this movie
4410286 there is a heart and soul that he brought to zuba
4410287 it is a testament to software and computing power and how it has advanced and to the talent of the people at the studio
4410288 nothing will change in regard to cruises involvement with ua and he continues to have a substantial ownership interest in the company furthermore cruise and wagner will continue to work on film projects together
4410289 until now we didnt have a movie that was done but now we have a movie starring tom cruise that deserves the best possible playtime
4410290 ive truly relished working with my longtime partner tom cruise to revitalize united artists and i am proud of all that weve accomplished in the past two years reinvigorating the brand and developing such a strong slate of films
4410291 but i always tell my sons follow your passion and ive got to follow that advice myself as much as ive enjoyed my time as an executive i have longed to return to my true love which is making movies so thats what ive decided to do i still believe in our vision for ua and i am confident that harry sloan and our colleagues at mgm will see that vision through to reality
4410292 in my game show career ive worked with tv stars film stars sports figures legendary musicians and many other contestants
4410293 now im thrilled to be working with my furry friends cats its a first for me and im delighted to be partnering with meow mix and gsn
4410294 this is an in depth detailed examination thats beyond what has been broadcast in terms of these typical type of biographies
4410295 we specifically wanted to let the facts speak for themselves and let the people who have known him and examined him speak for themselves
4410296 by any standards obamas rise in politics has been meteoric
4410297 everything we are learning about barack obama in one respect or another is new
4410298 the voters are evaluating these men obama and mccain and i believe these documentaries are terrific learning tools by which people can watch and learn discuss and decide
4410299 saya menyanjung tinggi komitmen yang diberikan ustaz hadi bahawa pas akan terus kekal dalam pakatan rakyat
4410300 saya juga berterima kasih dan menghargai sokongan pas khususnya tuan guru nik aziz untuk membantu saya di permatang pauh kerjasama ini amat saya alu alukan
4410301 apa yang penting kita pemimpin dan ahli pakatan rakyat mesti mengelakkan dan mengetepikan manipulasi media yang senantiasa mahu memecahkanbelahkan perpaduan kita
4410302 this blog will provide context over the next two months with regular posts about the behind the scenes development of the release and continue through the release of the product
4410303 we as a team definitely learned some lessons about disclosure and how we can all too easily get ahead of ourselves in talking about features before our understanding of them is solid
4410304 our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk
4410305 one day if they talk about how michael phelps won 7 gold medals and lost a chance to win 8 theyll talk about who that guy is who took it away from him
4410306 hopefully ill be able to stay closer in the first 50 meters than thursday to milorad

4410317 de martes a s bado salimos a las seis los lunes a las cuatro de la ma ana porque tenemos que preparar la carnada para el d a
4410318 la idea es dar a conocer la labor que hace la gente del mar tanto marineros como mariscadoras
4410319 el buen tiempo que disfrutamos en la zona favorece bastante
4410320 suelen ser personas que residen en zonas no costeras en madrid valladolid palencia
4410321 los madrile os siempre vienen muy estresados pero cuando se bajan del barco salen como nuevos
4410322 est bamos de vacaciones en la zona y nos enteramos de que se pod a contratar esta excursi n y como en el pa s vasco no existe nada parecido y siempre me ha gustado mucho el mar no me lo pens
4410323 las m moas son enterramientos de las gentes que vivieron en el lugar entre el a o 4500 y el 2800 antes de cristo

4410325 se arranca en el norte all donde es visible el mar y se avanza hac a el sur en un espacio aislado rodeado de cumbres
4410326 something has to be done to show the russians that they cant just run roughshod over the continent
4410327 comme tous les studios nous ressentons toujours les r percussions de la gr ve des sc naristes qui a eu un impact sur la pr paration de sc narios pour dautres films en changeant les donn es de la concurrence en 2009 et en offrant de nouvelles opportunit s dont nous voulons profiter
4410328 si apre un nuovo capitolo per la nazionale i giocatori e tutto lo staff tecnico ha dichiarato queiroz vogliamo conservare il nostro posto tra le migliori del mondo e per questo dobbiamo cercare nuove soluzioni per le nuove necessit della squadra non vedo lora di iniziare le qualificazioni per la coppa del mondo fifa 2010 di lavorare con i giocatori e di cominciare a costruire una squadra che possa raggiungere i nostri obiettivi
4410329 i accuse the government of russia of a deliberate policy of ethnic cleansing
4410330 weve received 14 000 reports of brutal attacks slaughter rapes and internment of people in violation of the rules of the geneva convention and international humanitarian law
4410331 punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4410332 we are still in the negotiating process russians are trying to justify their invasion and to legalize their presence in georgia
4410333 i think we should take a closer look at it the peace agreement
4410334 we can forget about talks on georgias territorial integrity because its impossible to force south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be returned into georgias fold by force
4410335 georgias borders have been reaffirmed by numerous security council resolutions so the question of abkhazia and south ossetia will be the subject of international negotiations as they have been at the un security council
4410336 we never use cluster bombs there is no need to do so
4410337 im not buying into the theory of us just going out and enjoying the day at arsenal we have to try to be competitive and try to win the match
4410338 itll be tough against hamburg but well do whatever it takes to hand them a first defeat at the allianz arena
4410339 after all the fantastic moments we had at home last season we can hardly wait to run out in front of our fans again
4410340 semua sudah siap mulai dari undangan gaun sampai pernak perniknya tetapi mau gimana lagi kita harus hadapi semuanya
4410341 malam itu sheila minta izin pergi tetapi roger melarang terjadi konflik kecil di antara mereka
4410342 why would anyone want to watch a movie about abba
4410343 weve got some places selling alcohol for 60p or 80p a drink
4410344 wadworth opposed wetherspoon opening a pub in devizes when it submitted a planning application fearing it could lead to some pubs closing down
4410345 the lack of liquidity in the market and the presence of short sellers has created an ideal opportunity for investors with cash to buy at prices they couldnt have dreamed of before in five years time we will look back and describe these times as the bargain era
4410346 sadly the tables are as sticky as ever and while the cigarette smoke has gone that has only allowed the toilets odour to pervade the entire place
4410347 to me pubs seem the most significant contribution that the british have made to the cause of human happiness
4410348 this was expected the pub is just not busy any more it isnt worth staying open it is just rubbish in grimsby at the minute everyone is going out in cleethorpes and when we have closed people arent going to come out in grimsby for just two pubs
4410349 the area has been suffering quite a bit for the moment its the only one closing there are no wider conclusions to be drawn
4410350 the pubcos are particularly single minded and if the returns from selling booze arent sky high they maintain shareholder value by selling off the premises the main obstacle to their doing so is planning law which may prevent a change of use that is why the companies sometimes run down a pub deliberately putting in a hopeless manager or charging extortionate rent so that it becomes unviable then the council has no alternative but to approve the land being used for luxury homes or flats
4410351 well be the first pub in barracudas estate to offer our customers a carvery
4410352 its just a trial using a mobile carvery unit on a sunday
4410353 with the challenges we are all currently facing i feel that my prime consideration at this time has to be pbr
4410354 it is the applicants view that a restaurant can only enhance the area and the street when compared to the business that has occupied the building for more than 40 years
4410355 zum beispiel k nnen softwareentwickler den marktanteil f r ihre programme erh hen indem sie teile davon kostenlos verf gbar machen vergleichbar kann ein entwickler oder eine firma ihre reputation erh hen indem open source projekte gef rdert werden auch kann ein softwarehersteller dank schnellen kostenlosen hinweisen von externen experten ein produkt verbessern

4410358 on april 17 a month and a half after scheunemann stopped working for georgia his partner signed a 200 000 agreement with the georgian government the deal added to an arrangement that brought in more than 800 000 to the two man firm from 2004 to mid 2007 for the duration of the campaign scheunemann is taking a leave of absence from the firm
4410359 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
4410360 for the duration of the campaign scheunemann is taking a leave of absence from the firm
4410361 why is georgia good and russia bad why does mccain decide who we side with
4410362 we had serious talks over some issues and i let out a piece of my mind to the guys we have to know what were here for and approach our games with business like attitude
4410363 i am not blaming anyone but we have taken things a bit too easy in the previous games and i needed to let them know that we have got to the crunch and it gets much tougher from here
4410364 its my birthday today thursday but im not looking forward to a better present from the boys than victory over the ivorians on saturday
4410365 afraid alone angry anxious ashamed confused depressed helpless in denial numb overwhelmed panicky powerless relieved that you finally know whats wrong sad shocked stressed
4410366 countrywide made loans to west virginia consumers on terms that were unaffordable and unconscionable these loans exposed consumers to foreclosure and loss of their homes countrywide also used unfair and deceptive acts or practices to make loans and service loans
4410367 we cdes chinamasa and nicholas goche are travelling to south africa with president mugabe today as the negotiations continue
4410368 the talks never collapsed and all parties are committed to the dialogue i would also want to confirm commitment to see the talks end successfully sooner rather than later to the peoples expectations
4410369 we cannot continue wandering around without direction hence the need to swear in parliamentarians and open the house so that the elected members can continue to fulfil their constitutional mandate
4410370 he has flown out of the country with secretary general tendai biti and deputy treasurer elton mangoma who are the main negotiators
4410371 allow me to point out and express my sincere appreciation and recognition of the role being played by south african president mr thabo mbeki which has seen a convergence of opinion which the nation hopes and trusts will lead to enduring peace in the country
4410372 as the zrp we are naturally hopeful that these efforts will lead to the promotion and sustenance of a peaceful social environment which will free the nation to robustly confront the economic challenges
4410373 the move that has been taken by the three major political parties in the country to engage in negotiations with a view to solving the countrys economic and political problems should be applauded
4410374 what the police service commission did was the best not minding who and who were involved the truth of the matter is that due process was not followed and you can imagine a situation where a police officer would be promoted ahead of over 2 000 of his colleagues and same person becomes the inspector general of police what that means is that he would retire the over 2 000 officers for him to be comfortable and that would be very dangerous for the country
4410375 i was once in the force and i retired as a assistant inspector general of police this matter is very topical but let us not be personal let us not be sentimental about this matter
4410376 will not take this from you what is personal about what we are doing no no no i asked a question from the chairman of the police service commission and not to you what are you talking about
4410377 you are being personal and i cannot be a party to this
4410378 you can get out if you are a retired aig this is senate you can get out
4410379 are you saying i should get out of this meeting are you driving me out
4410380 illegality unconstitutionality and flagrant abuse of the provisions of the 1999 constitution as well as the act establishing the commission because he had no such powers to carry out those promotions
4410381 the commission is a direct product of the 1999 constitution which is supreme
4410382 section 29 in its third schedule of the police service commission gives the commision the responsibility to carry out promotions of police officers up to the rank of deputy inspector general of police and it is clear that the former igp gave out what he did not have power to give
4410383 we are not here to moralise this is a constitutional matter and the law does not follow the path of sentiments and every beneficiary of illegal system must surrender what he has benefited
4410384 we discovered that former igp ehindero promoted some people above 2 000 other officers and that we said is unconstitutional because the promotion of officers must be based on seniority and even if it were the president that did it we would have reversed it because the president has no such powers
4410385 as painful as it is we have a responsibility to keep our commitment to the international community promote international peace and cooperation and advance the course of african brotherhood and good neighbourliness
4410386 most importantly however this is president umaru musa yaraduas practical demonstration of his administrations total commitment to the rule of law it is in his sincere believe that if african leaders believe and adhere totally to the rule of law peace would reign on this continent

4410593 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4410594 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4410595 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4410596 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4410618 la ltima oportunidad de un cambio pac fico en ecuador
4410619 se trata de un debate sobre valores en el que no hay posibilidad de llegar a un acuerdo sin embargo conviene mencionar que un sector de la iglesia cat lica critica fuertemente los temas se alados mientras que otro sector apoya la nueva carta magna
4410620 tiene m s que ver con una puesta en el escenario pol tico de temas alusivos a valores espec ficos que la iglesia califica de innegociables son temas que competen a la decisi n privada de las personas sin ser necesariamente temas constitucionales los valores sobre todo a los ojos de la iglesia son motivo de fe no de raz n la posibilidad de llegar a un acuerdo es nula
4410621 la iglesia est interviniendo en la agenda pol tica de ecuador lo hace tanto desde la c pula como desde otros sectores lo que llama la atenci n es que vuelva a actuar en pol tica despu s de m s de treinta a os de no hacerlo la ltima vez que la iglesia cat lica tuvo participaci n importante en la pol tica fue en la d cada de los 60 es preocupante que ahora se vuelva a involucrar en pol tica sea a favor o en contra de la nueva constituci n esta situaci n no es buena para el pa s ni para la iglesia cat lica

4410624 no deja de ser un factor importante tener en contra a la c pula de la iglesia cat lica ellos dicen todos los d as que la nueva constituci n tiene valores que van en contra de los que propugna la religi n cat lica fue un error del gobierno y los asamble stas haberse dejado llevar a este debate sobre valores
4410625 we are always keen to develop our range of commercial partners and working with superleague formula gives us an excellent opportunity to do that
4410626 this also provides an interesting and new dimension for liverpool fans to support their team in a different way and in a different sport the opening race at donnington is a great chance for our uk based fans to see the car in action and the short and long term plans to grow the series will reach out to our fanbase globally

4410634 worries about an economic slowdown in the u s and europe and even japan are weighing on the oil market

4410662 we go to the authorities and they simply say that they know nothing when i know that ice has been here
4410663 i know ice wont invade a city unless they get permission from the local authorities so to me the local authorities are informed they just dont want to tell us
4410664 if federal officials request the cooperation of police in any operation obviously they cooperate fully
4410665 in this case they did not make that request they merely notified us that this operation was going on
4410666 we are here today to denounce the operations which are intimidating militaristic and discriminatory
4410667 we need an immigration system that respects the two principles of liberty and democracy under which this country was founded
4410668 the way the system is right now they dont want us to drive they dont want our kids to go to school
4410669 the highest education you can get is high school and after that youre dead so what is this country doing they are setting us up so that tomorrow the latinos will be the failure of this country

4410726 the agreement says that on oct 1 well probably get another overnight and that will stay in place until the end of the year or the end of the conservatorship

4410735 many ossetians i met both in tskhinvali and in the main refugee camp in russia are furious about what has happened to their city
4410736 they are very clear who they blame georgias president mikhail saakashvili who sent troops to re take control of this breakaway region
4410737 witness accounts and the timing of the damage would point to georgian fire accounting for much of the damage described in tskhinvali
4410738 this is something that had it been about south ossetia could have been resolved within certain limits
4410739 russian peacekeepers were in the area that is true and russia initially said it needed to act to protect its peacekeepers and its people
4410740 but what russia has done is well beyond anything that anyone could say is for the protection of those people and for those peacekeepers

4410746 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4410747 i consider that the united states is not acting in a cautious manner in this situation
4410748 instead of getting full moral and political support in the struggle against real aggression and ethnic cleansing we have heard a mass of unpleasant words and threats that will of course not strengthen our relations
4410749 it cant be open ended either geographically or in time
4410750 it has to be circumscribed and its got to be in the context of the russians withdrawing all their armed forces
4410751 if tomorrow president saakashvili signs these documents then the withdrawal of the russian troops can start
4410752 it is over three weeks since we learned that the portuguese authorities had closed the investigation to find madeleine lifted our arguido status and ended judicial secrecy
4410753 we were surprised that copies of investigation files were given to the media the content of these files has been extensively reported
4410754 it will be clear to everyone now that there is absolutely no evidence that suggests madeleine has been seriously harmed
4410755 knowing this we strongly believe that madeleine is out there and can be found
4410756 of course whoever is responsible for madeleines abduction must and can be found to prevent them from putting another child and family through the misery we have suffered
4410757 we have always believed that this heinous crime could be solved with the help of the public
4410758 then why all the rush to interpolated 120hz 100hz pal for home movie display
4410759 live big screen video using hand held cameras would be inadequate at 48p
4410760 is that why they all walk out on 60 hz hdtv oh wait they dont
4410761 i thought the audience walked out on the high film frame rate because it was too realistic now youre saying they cant tell the difference must have been an audience of supermen eh
4410762 the point where you cant tell the difference anymore is somewhere over 72 fps
4410763 personally i hate the jerky 24 fps film look id take 60 or 72 fps any day
4410764 flicker is noticed more with computer displays due to the white sheet of paper model flat white areas appear to flicker more than dark
4410765 another movie he directed brainstorm was originally designed to highlight a projection technology he was promoting the movie was about recording experiences in the film the recorded experiences were going to be played at 48 frames per second as opposed to the standard 24 frames per second his feeling was that audiences had gotten used to the look of standard film people were subliminally aware of the 24 frame per second flicker by projecting the film at twice the standard rate the flicker was harder to perceive and the film would be given that much more immediacy however it was impossible to convince the theater owners to install the special projectors to show the recorded experience sequences the movie was released as a conventional film fortunately the story stood up well on its own partly correct showscan runs at 60fps when he was doing test work for 2001 i believe it was on the spacewalk footage but its been years since i read up on the process and things have blurred for me he accidentally ran a sequence at 60fps and the uniform reaction in the booth was shock that hed gotten a 3d effect with a conventional camera he did dream up brainstorm to use the process but the studio hed been working with didnt want to install the only projector on the market that would run 60fps for an extended period without breaking for just one film and he ended up taking the story idea with him to mgm as i remember it he had to do a sizable payout to get it from his previous studio even then mgm wouldnt go for it compare and contrast with the ua chain which installed a highly sophisticated 3d system in a number of their theaters including seattle and ended up offering a couple of million dollars as a bounty to get someone anyone to shoot a feature using it there were several showscan shorts shot the one at expo 86 the one on magic tricks starring christopher lee and it looked like hed finally get them in widespread distribution when he signed a deal with a major restaurant chain to add a showscan theater to each of their restaurants but the chain was chuck e cheese and the deal was about two months before they imploded of all the reviews i read about the process the one that stuck with me was the one in cinefantastique that said makeup technology was going to have to improve greatly if the process was going to catch on you could apparently see every pore on christopher lees face

4410769 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4410770 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4410771 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4410772 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4410773 running talking excessively and out of his seat disturbing others
4410774 they are the same rules as last year you dont run you stop talking you listen to the teacher
4410775 many of our visitors to the baths also travel regularly on the car ferry this is why we decided to introduce a common customer card
4410776 i know there have been a lot of questions asked was he forced out the door etc etc
4410777 but the clear fact is we sent out on the website an honest statement by the chief executive martin bain explaining the situation
4410778 but then people want to read into it and put their own twist on it theres not a lot we can do
4410779 for all intents and purposes any proposal for charter change even if its forced will be dead

4410783 i went there because i was invited as a member of the diplomatic corps and when youre a member and you get invited if youre available you should go
4410784 for all intents and purposes any proposal for charter change even if its forced will be dead
4410785 if the constituent assembly has been convened it has plenary powers i dont think you can limit by law what the constituent assembly can take up
4410786 i told them look were now debating for the world championships
4410787 the opportunity to travel opportunity to meet international debaters the ability to engage in constructive dialogue with people from these so called hallowed universities like cambridge and oxford thats appealing
4410788 now people as far as mindanao are now interested in it
4410789 manila based schools used to dominate tourneys but that was because they had more training more support more funding and more exposure to excellent debaters from abroad but that doesnt mean that if given the chance non manila schools wont perform just as well
4410790 it really helps that there are strong provincial teams in national tournaments so it debunks the mindset of manila based adjudicators judges that the provincial teams are weaker
4410791 the ability of a team is not contingent on where they come from
4410792 you realized that you are not debating with your colleagues anymore you are debating for the public youre not just arguing for yourself or for your opponent youre arguing for the public
4410793 a debaters first responsibility now is to engage the audience

4410813 die eltern m gen sich an den beginn des verfahrens 19 f 76 04 vor dem amtsgericht m nchengladbach rheydt erinnern zum damaligen zeitpunkt war es so dass die antragstellerin mit jessica aufgrund von drohungen und gewaltt tigen und sexuellen bergriffen des antragstellers in einem frauenhaus untergebracht wurden
4410814 das unterlassen einer anzeigenerstattung durch einen amtstr ger der von einer eventuellen strafbaren handlung erf hrt kann nur dann im sinne einer strafvereitelung strafbar sein wenn eine pflicht zur anzeigenerstattung besteht dies ist unter den von ihnen geschilderten umst nden sowohl hinsichtlich der zust ndigen richterin als auch hinsichtlich der mitarbeiterin des jugendamtes nicht der fall

4410828 and in case russia is persistently driven into a corner then it will be possible to undertake to sell military nuclear and missile technologies to such countries as iran and iraq and to algeria after islamic forces arrive in power there
4410829 moreover russias direct military alliance with some of the countries mentioned also should not be excluded above all with iran within the framework of which a russian troop contingent and tactical nuclear weapons could be stationed on the shores of the persian gulf and the strait of hormuz

4410832 the recent blasts in our embassy in kabul have cast a shadow over our efforts to normalize relations with pakistan and to bring a lasting and honourable peace in our region
4410833 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4410834 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take

4410858 ayer mi rcoles cerca del medio d a pasamos los dos millones de votos y yo le dec a al vicepresidente alvaro garc a linera y a algunos ministros que estaban en palacio hemos cumplido con la palabra de tupaj katari qu dijo l yo muero pero volver convertido en millones
4410859 el gran conflicto que estamos viviendo entre estos dos a os y medio es esa relaci n del gobierno con las prefecturas estamos en un proceso de ajuste estructural del estado
4410860 creo que otorgar an una mayor credibilidad objetividad en el plano metodol gico de la propia lectura de los datos que las encuestas fueran realizadas por instituciones acad micas universidades
4410861 si bien las autonom as deben constitucionalizarse esta debe ser sobre la base del di logo y no en la forma que quiere llevar adelante el prefecto cruce o rub n costas con la imposici n

4410869 hemos vivido acontecimientos parecidos a los que pretendieron realizar el pasado domingo en bolivia donde m s del 80 por ciento de la poblaci n a pesar de las amenazas de las dificultades que pudieran haber presentado salieron a la calle para respaldar el proceso democr tico que encarna el presidente evo morales

4410877 there is a strong us dollar theme across markets building momentum from the day before
4410878 i believe this is the beginning of a us dollar correction of the major move lower so the next three to six months is bullish for the dollar
4410879 for asia it will ebb and flow between different currencies those ahead of the curve on inflation will perform better in the long term those behind and with deficits will suffer
4410880 the weakness in the singapore dollar is in tandem with the big us dollar move with lots of buying interest from the opening levels this morning
4410881 at the same time we will have volunteers touring towns and villages in the affected area of north cotabato to assess what is needed
4410882 according to the ndcc there were 40 on wednesday and they have since opened 12 more latest estimates put the number of displaced at 164 800

4410884 it will be the peoples decision if they want to go back to their homes we will not push them
4410885 this is a softer approach we have already notified several key countries about the theoretical and practical aspects of execution and most feel it should be doable
4410886 we hope that china wont block this approach and that their leaders will finally understand the hopes of taiwans 23 million people for entering global organisations

4410904 only peace negotiations and aggressive efforts at effective governance with concrete results in armm will bring about lasting peace and prosperity
4410905 the moa should not be forced down our throats the credibility of these peace pacts is now highly suspect with malaca ang pressing for cha cha along with it and the flawed exclusive process undertaken to have the agreement
4410906 we have learned over the past several weeks how unaware the affected local governments and their people were to what the government peace panel was doing behind their backs by creating a separate bangsamoro juridical entity within the country the government would have only succeeded in increasing hostilities in the south under the guise of a peace agreement
4410907 because it is flawed in the process just as it is flawed in its provisions

4410912 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4410913 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4410914 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4410915 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4410916 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4410917 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4410918 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4410919 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4410920 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4410921 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4410922 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4410923 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4410924 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4410925 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4410926 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4410927 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4410928 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4410929 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4410930 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4410931 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4410932 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4410933 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4410934 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4410935 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4410936 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4410937 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4410938 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4410939 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4410940 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4410941 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

4410945 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4410946 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4410947 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4410948 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4410949 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4410950 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4410951 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4410952 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4410953 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4410954 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4410955 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4410956 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4410957 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4410958 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4410959 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4410960 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4410961 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4410962 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4410963 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4410964 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4410965 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4410966 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4410967 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4410968 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4410969 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4410970 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4410971 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4410972 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4410973 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4410974 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4410975 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4410976 all happy people are grateful ungrateful people cannot be happy we tend to think that being unhappy leads people to complain but it is truer to say that complaining leads to people becoming unhappy
4410977 some people experience a serious mood change when the seasons change they may sleep too much have little energy and crave sweets and starchy foods they may also feel depressed though symptoms can be severe they usually clear up
4410978 smoking is prohibited in the hotel or on the grounds
4410979 in what other ways is this business falling down on the job
4410980 some people experience a serious mood change when the seasons change they may sleep too much have little energy and crave sweets and starchy foods they may also feel depressed though symptoms can be severe they usually clear up
4410981 she comes in kisses me on the nose and says good morning mommy
4410982 for a child who was supposed to be gone two years ago and is still here its amazing
4410983 the doctors were saying it was impossible that she had ewings sarcoma in the brain
4410984 there are so very few cases of that ever reported
4410985 there was no reason for anybody to look for anything unusual
4410986 i was in nursing school at the time and i immediately knew something was wrong
4410987 the tumor was larger than a softball and had collapsed both ventricles in her brain
4410988 they removed the tumor and sent it away to determine if it was benign or malignant the results came back that the tumor was extremely aggressive
4410989 at that point the doctors told us to take her home and enjoy what little time we had left
4410990 we were told that she most likely would be gone by christmas and that her chances for survival were 10 percent
4410991 seeing her go through that i thought for sure she wasnt going to make it
4410992 there were days where we wondered if today would be the last day
4410993 when somebody tells you your daughter is going to die within six months you start to wait for it
4410994 having her treated was the hardest thing ive ever had to do in my life but to me there was no other option i had to try
4410995 in general its difficult to cure the cancer without radiation
4410996 isabella wound up in intensive care and they werent sure if shed be strong enough for a third transplant
4410997 the doctors told us we want to warn you theres a possibility the tumor will come back
4410998 seems that there are more than a couple of folks taking notice of your postings tom excellent job i believe cleveland is better off because of the job you did

4411015 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4411016 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4411017 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4411018 we are travelling to south africa with president robert mugabe today as the negotiations continue
4411019 the talks never collapsed and all parties are committed to the dialogue i would also want to confirm commitment to see the talks end successfully sooner rather than later

4411030 were looking at programs were looking at where we can make cuts and still meet needs of teachers
4411031 were trying to be responsible its a balancing act we need to be careful we dont want to be the district that builds a school then has to put on an addition in five years
4411032 so if we think it makes sense and if the extra space is justified it might be approved an emphasis on might

4411040 im grateful to be part of portsmouth and grateful to portsmouth for letting me be part of it
4411041 when we were looking for volunteers to present at our year of series of business development seminars he stepped up to the plate several times sharing strategies on how to attract motivate and retain great sales people
4411042 and when we needed someone to lead the chambers ambassador committee where he has volunteered for many years he stepped up to the plate again using his expertise to build one of the most active groups the chamber has ever seen
4411043 i was starting a business in the city and wanted to meet people
4411044 i have met a lot of great people over the years and enjoyed working with the chamber
4411045 building portsmouth the neighborhoods and architecture of new hampshires oldest city
4411046 were sure his continued involvement will ensure a place where visitors and citizens alike will get a chance to discover some of the real wealth within our community our history our culture and our people
4411047 i never miss an opportunity to tell you to come to the discovery center and to join the portsmouth historical society
4411048 rather than join the chorus of some adults frustrated with a generation of young people who seem to be disconnected indifferent and unmotivated mcintosh decided to play an active role in unlocking the talent energy and interest of local students in a way that would contribute to the community and to our next crop of leaders
4411049 were not seeing any evidence that students are being affected at this point
4411050 most students are able to put together alternatives to come up with a financial aid package that works for them
4411051 students use that to cover the gap between what students receive in financial aid and what the college actually costs
4411052 talk to your financial aid offices and they will help you with your options students will be able to return to their schools
4411053 the best thing you can do is weatherize your home
4411054 it not only lowers your heating bill a weatherization will reduce by 20 percent your fuel consumption it also saves you money and keeps money in the maine economy
4411055 this is a crisis and theres no shame in reaching out
4411056 volunteers can only volunteer when they know who theyre looking to help
4411057 when we bring the flag down its called striking the colors now you can say youve learned something
4411058 when he settles in when there are runners on base he executes pitches
4411059 he gets comfortable gets in his delivery and gets in the flow of the game and really pitches well
4411060 we got all those runs near the beginning of the game so i should have been able to go out there and get outs at a better pace but i wasnt able to
4411061 i felt like i was struggling to get into a good groove all game
4411062 of course youre embarrassed were all embarrassed because we feel were better than that
4411063 our bullpen definitely didnt need to be in there for nine innings i wish i would have done better
4411064 new hampshire residents like americans everywhere have come to realize the importance of accessing domestic supply
4411065 for years they have relied on easily accessible sources of oil and natural gas to run their cars heat their homes and cook their food but the current situation is making everyday energy use a difficult proposition for many in the granite state
4411066 congress needs to acknowledge current day realities and lift the ban on domestic drilling
4411067 the burden of high gasoline costs is weighing heavily on the minds of new hampshire residents
4411068 and congress can address their concerns by bringing forth a balanced energy policy that includes the development of domestic oil and natural gas along with measures to encourage conservation efficiency and greater supplies of other forms of energy
4411069 the public has settled in their views about the war
4411070 seventy percent of animal abusers commit other crimes from murder to trafficking in drugs and firearms offenses
4411071 the last supreme court term which ended in june was the stormiest in recent memory with more 5 to 4 decisions split along ideological lines than at any time in the courts history in a series of controversial cases about abortion racial integration in schools faith based programs and the death penalty the courts four more conservative justices prevailed with justice anthony m kennedy providing the crucial fifth vote
4411072 it was tough for the players to go through that so they did what they had to do in order to stay loose
4411073 i told my kids to play loose because we were going to play one of the contenders coming into this tournament
4411074 i think they know that when i get messy i get determined and i figure it out for myself
4411075 its still long if i come back next year it will be shorter
4411076 there were very few vacant spots along the shore as crowds waved from prescott park the portsmouth naval shipyard and along the sarah mildred long bridge
4411077 we have five ships with the four tall ships and our own gundalow this is history making for us
4411078 its an original ship and represents a time when people were not only fishing but were racing these schooners
4411079 i usually wear shoes with at least three to four inch heels
4411080 my father my brother and all the men in my family are over 6 feet so that is what i am used to
4411081 i am short and i am looking for a man to father my children and i dont want to have short children
4411082 i just feel safer when i walk down the street with a man who is much taller than me
4411083 i am only attracted to tall men i just cant help it
4411084 you realize that if you are talking about growing old with a man most people shrink a couple of inches as they hit old age
4411085 well if hes going to shrink all the more reason to only meet someone very tall
4411086 it can be compared to someone stealing the traffic lights on a busy main street
4411087 if you play him enough times hes bound to have an off day

4411099 my goal was to come in in pre season get my head down and give the manager a headache at wigan
4411100 but when you are told your first team opportunities are limited it takes the wind out of you
4411101 luckily the gaffer here said that hed like me to try to help hull i never wanted to leave wigan and i still havent but im glad its been resolved and im looking forward to tomorrow and playing my part
4411102 there are no hard feelings against fulham watford at the time did not want to renegotiate the deal
4411103 whether it be arsenal man united fulham im looking forward to being part of history hulls first game in the premier league
4411104 im sure we will be nervous as they will be and it will be an exciting encounter we are preparing for a match that will test us to the limit
4411105 we all know that most teams prefer to stay away from newly promoted teams in the early part of the season they often start like a house on fire but you play every team twice and take each team as they come
4411106 hull might not be one of the teams tipped for one of the top places but we are fully aware that they will be firing on all cylinders and we will have to be at our best to get a result
4411107 we will have to go to places like anfield and there are plenty of grounds where the atmosphere is going to be fierce and the support fanatical
4411108 who can save us now brand new superheroes and their amazing short stories

4411110 you wait here papa i am going to go and get you a pepsi
4411111 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defense system will be deployed not against
4411112 i consider that the united states is not acting in a cautious manner in this situation
4411113 instead of getting full moral and political support in the struggle against real aggression and ethnic cleansing we have heard a mass of unpleasant words and threats that will of course not strengthen our relations
4411114 a thorough assessment process would need to be undertaken before considering a full scale bid
4411115 lodging an expression of interest however keeps aru in the ball park while assessing what would clearly be a daunting financial challenge
4411116 look at how many times our swimmers have been tested i assure you that this is a clean team
4411117 why do they accuse us every time we are doing well why dont they look at those times when we are not good
4411118 i do not think officials should enter into speculation like that to question an achievement that has been made by an athlete in beijing particularly if someone is in an official position
4411119 people are looking for reasons for record breaking performances other than the real reason swimmers are swimming really well and coaches are coaching really well
4411120 its the first time ive seen this happen i dont know what the agenda with the itf international tennis federation is but i think its pretty unfortunate that theyre doing that
4411121 i was getting to friday afternoon and i was still pretty sore and tired from the previous week
4411122 i was waking up on saturday and hoping id be right for the weekends game
4411123 i think once you start doing that its out of your control and you have to have a serious look at your future
4411124 when you go from extreme high water to low water that has a tendency to leave behind significant sediment and it shifts channels unexpectedly
4411125 when you have a flood you get a combination of sediment and soil coming off the farm fields and golf courses and streets and yards
4411126 also the energy from the flow picks up sand off the bottom of the river it swirls it all together in this milky hazy mixture that comes down the river during flooding
4411127 part of discovery is finding things that you least expect
4411128 when you come across something like this it sends a tingle up your spine

4411130 while r1soft happens to be the only continuous data protection solution for linux servers the windows market has long been familiar with cdp technology typically what we see with other windows cdp software is that it requires extensive training and support from the vendor and in some products it is impossible to use without the customer investing in specialized storage area network hardware most it environments are mixed platform and the market wants an easy to use high performance backup tool for both windows and linux
4411131 most it administrators who try our cdp software for linux say wow that was so easy
4411132 this board restructuring takes account of the dramatically different company that redhall has become over the last three years and focuses on balancing the key strengths of our senior management team in order to be better prepared for our drive for further growth
4411133 we need to change our mentality quickly for the premier league opener
4411134 facing sunderland away will be a very tough game they have strengthened their squad and are always difficult on their own ground
4411135 we have a few minor injuries bruises and so on xabi alonso and yossi benayoun have got some small problems but they will be okay for the game in sunderland
4411136 we would have preferred that he did not need to play we waited and waited but in the end we needed him because we were not in control of midfield
4411137 competition for places must improve we have several away or injured we need more players to put pressure on players
4411138 i do not like to talk about specific players but clearly we were not the best we were not good in midfield or the defence
4411139 we are in the market for a striker and made a substantial offer which has been well documented
4411140 we will have to wait and see what happens we are trying to address certain weaknesses in the team and we will continue to do that right until the window closes
4411141 we have problems up front as we are missing key personnel we are a little bit light and went with two young guys who are still learning the game it was difficult for them
4411142 i think what the bid does show is that the club is in decent shape financially and that we were able to make a bid of that significance
4411143 maybe the stories of the financial crisis flying around are not as substantiated as they should be
4411144 thats the first win ive had at dundrod in the 125cc class
4411145 it was a tremendous race and on the last lap i knew that william was going to be a major danger for he took the lead at leathmstown i counterattacked and on the final bend for home i knew i had a major chance i took the inside line and i didnt know what william had done i was too anxious to see that chequered flag

4411153 if she had died with hospice care her last few months of life would have been much more comfortable
4411154 her symptoms would have been managed her pain would have been controlled and there would have been people that counseled with her to keep her from being so worried and nervous about what would hap pen when she died all those things would have made a tremendous difference in the quality of her end of life
4411155 you dont really understand and a lot of peo ple are not familiar with hospice facilities until they face that situation
4411156 not only were they caring for my father they were also caring for me its priceless
4411157 our mission is to embrace those who are dy ing with the best of care wherever there is a need in arkansas so we are really stretching ourselves to try to reach rural arkansas
4411158 reaching those patients is very expensive and hard to do but were committed to try to reach those who need that service
4411159 the hospice mission is pretty clearcut but what distinguishes ours is to treat people who are dying with love and dignity and to aid their families not only during the time of the act of dying but also afterwards
4411160 we offer counseling and help for the people who are left behind theres resources theres help its compassion and care but whats different about arkansas hospice is we dont refuse people but you still get the highest level of care thats available
4411161 my menu will be completely different every day of the week and it will be based on whats ripe delicious and in season also the weather plays a big role in my menus and what im hungry for is a key component because typically i eat my own dinner special
4411162 because we help so many charities but i just think its something that we can do and we should do we should give back to the community that supports us
4411163 things are getting pretty tight for the restaurant industry food costs are going through the roof and business is starting to slow a little bit so we have to think harder about what were giving away in this case i think this is an interesting approach because we can factor the gift in to the price of the meal
4411164 its a whole different way of getting people to come out and support a nonprofit and i think its a great way to give back to hospice and it gives back to the restaurants because its during a slow time of the year
4411165 people are getting kids back to school theyre buying clothing theyre taking that last minute vacation so itd be nice to go out to a place like vermillion and be able to get a prix fixe meal and not feel guilty about it
4411166 i think that this community probably more so than most has got a really nice proportion of good restaurants per capita
4411167 i think thats really kind of the fun thing about little rock when you get the chef owner operated real hands on kind of restaurants like weve got a lot of around the city that makes it even more of a connection

4411196 ok son but its going to hurt a lot you do realize this dont you
4411197 does this mean i have to get a plaster cast
4411198 yeah sometimes i dont understand this regional non league pyramid it is supposed to be a relatively local league and yet we face 184 miles to workington
4411199 but we have just got to get on with it i would rather have it out of the way now rather than the last away game of the season we may as well just brave the journey
4411200 that said i will taking no excuses from the players for poor performances either this is life in the blue square north if you dont like it earn the right to play a better level
4411201 i know i am always harping on about how i want the fans behind us but i do understand if they dont make it to those two away games
4411202 tell them to save their money for the next home game at marston road i have also told the players if they dont like it lets have back to back promotions and get into the football league
4411203 at the end of it it was two points dropped rather than one won we didnt pass tackle or anything in the second half i expect better
4411204 i know some people say that an away point is a point well earned but that is not my way i want to win every game and my players do too
4411205 it was a superb goal from tom and he looks to be a really good player i have already extended his loan for two months such is the impression he is making
4411206 at the moment the agreement is suiting him stoke and us if that continues i would not rule out having him here for the season

4411214 after the positive experience with the vicious engine during the development of our earlier xbox live title elements of destruction we decided that it made great sense to use the middleware again for our three upcoming games
4411215 so far the production processes for all titles have been smooth thanks to the powerful toolset offered by vicious cycle
4411216 the creative staff at frozen codebase has really showcased the versatility of vicious engine through zombie wranglers and fresco beach
4411217 vicious engine offers a balance of flexibility and stability that is up to any task from developing an action survival comedy to a building simulation
4411218 you dont want to take anyone for granted you want to let everyone know that their vote counts that you care about their issues and that youre listening

4411225 this is probably one of the first political campaigns ive ever gotten involved in
4411226 i didnt get politically involved or understand why i should get politically involved until i saw barack at georgia tech last fall
4411227 at first i think it was because he was just so charismatic and you can sit and listen to him for hours then as i followed the campaign i saw the consistency of his character
4411228 the idea of completely changing the way that america looks at leadership maybe getting away from the idea that only white men can be president maybe america is getting closer to the idea of equality
4411229 most of the time i dont watch anything to do with politics barack impressed me when he told an african american church that they need to support their gay brothers
4411230 i feel he doesnt mind pushing the limit to get his point out there
4411231 i think there are two or three things that would have to happen in order for obama to win this state
4411232 there would have to be large black turnout but i dont think you can boost black turnout enough to win just by that that so the other thing obama has to do is attract a much larger percentage of the white vote than even georgians like mark taylor have gotten
4411233 obama needs to get a share of the white vote
4411234 the rule of thumb used to be in georgia that you needed 90 percent among from black voters and 40 percent among of the white vote to win as a democrat
4411235 you have to figure that most of bob barrs votes are going to come from whites
4411236 so if bob barr runs well and takes a good percentage of votes it will primarily be white votes then thats the perfect storm for obama
4411237 if its close enough than it can make a difference
4411238 an energized gay community could help obama gain support in the white community and going back as far as 2002 democrats have not done well there
4411239 if 100 percent of the gay people in georgia turn out to vote obama will win
4411240 i think it might be a little tighter race than say for bush in 04 but one thing it has done for us is it has made our people realize they have to work harder
4411241 i dont intend to be the first woman elected chairman of georgia and not to deliver georgia and its 13 electoral votes to a republican
4411242 we kwamen wat energie tekort we hadden een goede start maar dat kostte veel energie
4411243 mijn belangrijkste doel is het goud misschien helpt het een handje als ik topscorer word maar dat laatste is niet mijn eerste doel
4411244 man wird der bundeskanzlerin unseren standpunkt ausf hrlich erl utern und auch wirklich handfeste beweise vorlegen die die gr ueltaten der georgischen soldateska in s dossetien belegen

4411251 the aztec culture had a lot of mummies and some of their mummy designs for the foundation army were taken from mexican mummies that they have found so i think that somehow that might make the basis of a good story
4411252 we were surprised by the severity of the residual sleep apnea in postoperative patients
4411253 the majority of individuals still had moderate to severe osa
4411254 the second surprising finding of this study was that despite the persistence and severity of the disease most people thought their sleep apnea was resolved after their weight loss and only a few still used cpap
4411255 we connected the dots to draw a critical conclusion and found evidence over the amazon that traces the direct path of the effect of human activity on climate change by way of human caused aerosols
4411256 scientists have observed instances where increases or decreases in the amount of these tiny particles have increased and decreased cloud cover in different places and times
4411257 we saw an example of this ourselves increased aerosols over the amazon produced less cloud cover over the atlantic ocean however increased aerosols actually produced more cloud cover
4411258 we wanted to know what the link was between these different outcomes from varying amounts and types of aerosols this paper gives us a clear picture of what is occurring
4411259 this result helps us understand aerosols effect on a clouds mass and lifetime how long it will provide cloud cover how deep the clouds will be and when and where it will rain
4411260 we are trying to identify the mechanisms through which blood pressure is regulated under normal everyday conditions which is what stress is and take that information back to the clinic to better determine what sort of therapy is going to be most effective at treating your blood pressure
4411261 this research will give us information that allows us to identify what treatment is going to be effective in what individual by genotype by obesity and other factors what kind of treatment is going to be effective at keeping an individuals blood pressure down or maybe preventing it from ever getting high

4411272 if the price move in platinum and palladium of the last month or so has been down to the bearish projection for car sales that will affect rhodium even more
4411273 also if car companies are in a bad way and are looking to cut costs rhodium is something they will be trying to use as little as possible
4411274 rhodium is used in the electronic sector and as long as retail remains under pressure and growth in industrial production is uncertain it should come off
4411275 the run up in prices to 10 000 has really caused automakers to examine very closely how they can reduce their use of the metal
4411276 over the next few years those efforts will bear fruit
4411277 on the supply side should south african production expand as we expect it to despite the power issues there then we will see supply rising
4411278 so fundamentally from a supply and demand point of view the market should become easier over the medium term
4411279 second was a good result and i put some more boats between myself and zach

4411282 its not over yet by a long way im going to have to go out there and get a good race in
4411283 geoff i thought the way you tackled this was good i particularly liked the way you
4411284 i feel like youre not listening to me when you finish my sentences for me you did that a few times when we were talking about the project plan i want to finish what im saying before you add your points
4411285 you really seem to be making an impact on the team
4411286 do you have any ideas about how i could do this differently so i can get a better result
4411287 so you think that the meeting went very badly this afternoon and my presentation was a particular problem can you tell me where you think i went wrong and what i could do differently next time
4411288 sending them to put out a fire in the wilderness is both overkill and unnecessary
4411289 firefighters are being ordered to take significant risks of their lives health and safety that are incommensurate with the benefits of suppression
4411290 we ought to be treating these forests in the winter and the spring not in august
4411291 why are you letting random events dictate how you manage these forests
4411292 nicky ist nicht hier und er kann auch nicht bei den tests dabei sein

4411294 ich habe einige zeit in woking verbracht wo ich gemeinsam mit meinen ingenieuren vorbereitungen f r das kommende wochenende getroffen habe ich war auch eine weile in finnland in meinem heimatort suomussalmi
4411295 dort helfe ich ein j hrliches kartevent zu organisieren dass ich das j ngste formel 1 rennen gewonnen hatte machte es f r alle beteiligten zu einer gro artigen angelegenheit
4411296 seit einer langen zeit war ich wieder einmal in finnland und es war so toll dort als grand prix sieger auftauchen zu k nnen
4411297 ich denke noch immer dass ich mich verbessere und mit jedem rennen mehr ber den wagen und das team lerne meine zielsetzung f r die restliche saison ist mehr rennen zu gewinnen und regelm ig vorne mit dabei zu sein das konnte ich in der ersten jahresh lfte von zeit zu zeit erreichen
4411298 doch jetzt f hle ich mich als konstanter herausforderer in den verbleibenden rennen darauf freue ich mich schon tierisch
4411299 der kurs sieht ehrlich gesagt ziemlich schnell aus f r gew hnlich sind stra enkurse eher langsam mit vielen langsamen und mittelschnellen kurven und kurzen geraden
4411300 es gibt viele schnelle ecken und schikanen eine reihe netter geraden und viel hochgeschwindigkeitsabschnitte es ist allerdings noch zu fr h um zu sagen ob es dort berholm glichkeiten geben wird in einigen haarnadelkurven k nnte es aber m glich sein
4411301 when you go from extreme high water to low water that has a tendency to leave behind significant sediment and it shifts channels unexpectedly
4411302 when you have a flood you get a combination of sediment and soil coming off the farm fields and golf courses and streets and yards
4411303 also the energy from the flow picks up sand off the bottom of the river it swirls it all together in this milky hazy mixture that comes down the river during flooding
4411304 it shows the world we can come back no matter what i gave my heart and soul out there its been a really long road and im proud to be here its easier than coming second to a different country
4411305 whether its me up there or nastia we are both wearing usa and it makes us both proud to see our colours and our country up there nastia deserved the gold
4411306 we both supported each other 100 percent and just wanted to go out there and give it our all and have fun because this is the games nothing is bigger or greater than this
4411307 in between events we look at each other and give a head nod it means so many words i was trying to encourage her and say come on without distracting her
4411308 its going to be a great motivational event for the young generation to come im so proud
4411309 this is absolutely incredible for the united states of america gymnastics theres more to come
4411310 jayson fouled it off and it hit him in the eye
4411311 hes in bad shape theres a lot of blood inside and outside of the eye
4411312 im really not in favor of a guy squaring around to hit the ball and a guy throwing it right at his head
4411313 its hard to get out of the way of that pitch
4411314 in my wildest imagination i didnt think they would throw right at his coconut
4411315 they said it was swelling with a lot of bleeding
4411316 no game of baseball is worth that as far as im concerned
4411317 i just dont like it played that way and me losing a player ive lost him probably for the rest of the series
4411318 in the format throwing at guys in that situation to defend the wheel i dont think its the place for it
4411319 this is a very unwelcome and unacceptable activity in china
4411320 most people from abroad do not understand the whole tibet issue tibet is an inalienable part of china and the whole world recognizes it
4411321 a small number of people are trying to split the territory and that is not going to work at all
4411322 most of the people in these demonstrations are non chinese so i think they do not know much about the situation
4411323 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4411324 planning a wedding is very stressful its crazy my gardener is now invited
4411325 the information we are all giving to online companies is massive and dangerous and securitys going to get worse before it gets better

4411328 at the stroke of the mid night hour when the world sleeps india will awake to life and freedom a moment comes which comes but rarely in history when we step out from the old to the new when an age ends and when the soul of a nation long suppressed finds utterance we end today a period of ill fortune and india discovers herself again
4411329 there are some parts of the world that once visited get into your heart and wont go for me india is such a place when i first visited i was stunned by the richness of the land by its lush beauty and exotic architecture by its ability to overload the senses with the pure concentrated intensity of its colors smells tastes and sounds it was as if all my life i had been seeing the world in black and white and when brought face to face with india experienced everything re rendered in brilliant technicolor
4411330 nanti tutuplah kedai cina aku nak tengok berapa hari boleh bertahan
4411331 demikian pula jika hendak berniaga orang kita tiada bermodal dan tiada upaya mencari modal walau modal kecil kecil pun dengan ikhtiar sendiri dan sentiasa mereka mengaku tiada upaya itu sebaliknya jika ada modal pula mereka tiada upaya menjalankan perniagaan itu dengan jalan jalan yang betul dan cara yang teratur serta dengan amanah dan jimat cermat sehingga mencapai kejayaan dan dipercayai orang padahal bangsa bangsa lain yang datang sebagai sengkek mula mulanya ke negeri ini dengan tiada mempunyai sebarang harta dan wang belanja hanya ada tulang empat kerat dan akal ikhtiar serta kepercayaan akan kebolehan dirinya dapat mereka berikhtiar mencari wang bahkan dilihat mereka negeri ini sememangnya negeri yang kaya raya dan semua perkara boleh jadi wang sehingga sampah di tepi jalan itupun boleh jadi wang belaka sebab itulah mereka berkumpul ramai ke sini kemudian setelah dapat wang maka dengan berjimat cermat dan berdikit dikit dikumpulkan mereka lalu mereka membuka kedai kecil kecil barangkali di kampung kampung di kebun kebun getah atau di hulu hulu tetapi kerap kali yang kecil itu akhirnya menjadi besar dan maju lalu mereka berpindah berkedai di bandar bandar pula kesudahannya sehingga penuh segala bandar negeri negeri melayu ini oleh kedai dan tempat perniagaan mereka sahaja dan segala pasar pun kecil besar pada kebanyakan tempat mereka jugalah yang memegang dan memenuhinya sekalian itu ialah terutamanya oleh sebab mereka kuat berpegang kepada kebolehan sendiri begitulah sedikit daripada contoh yang menunjukkan kelemahan dan kekurangan kita daripada mereka itu dengan sebab mereka ada perangai percaya kepada kebolehan diri sendiri dan kuat bergantung kepada ikhtiar diri sendiri dan kita tidak ya berkecualian daripada keadaan yang telah diceritakan itu tentulah ada dan boleh terdapat di sana sini tetapi berapa orang barangkali tidak ada satu dalam seribu atau sepuluh ribu yang terlebih banyaknya ialah seperti yang diceritakan itu juga maka selagi tidak kita ubah sekalian ini diganti dengan perasaan dan pemandangan hidup yang lebih baik tidaklah akan diubah tuhan hal kita melainkan akan terbenam juga di dalam kubang kita yang ada ini selagi kita kekalkan sifat sifat kelemahan yang ada pada diri kita sekarang
4411332 akan menjalar kepada kamu penyakit umat umat yang terdahulu hasad dan benci membenci itu sebenarnya pencukur aku tidak menyatakan pencukur rambut tetapi ia mencukur agama
4411333 apakah patut mereka itu dengki kepada manusia disebabkan kelebihan yang allah berikan kepada mereka
4411334 wahai orang orang yang beriman jauhilah kebanyakan dari sangkaan supaya kamu tidak menyangka sangkaan yang dilarang kerana sesungguhnya sebahagian dari sangkaan itu adalah dosa dan janganlah kamu mengintip mencari cari kesalahan orang dan janganlah setengah kamu mengumpat antara satu sama lain adakah seseorang dari kamu suka memakan daging saudaranya yang telah mati maka sudah tentu kamu jijik kepadanya oleh itu patuhilah larangan larangan yang tersebut dan bertaqwalah kamu kepada allah sesungguhnya allah penerima taubat lagi maha mengasihani
4411335 namun perkara ini kesannya lebih jauh dari itu ia adalah prinsip islam yang utama dalam sistem kemasyarakatannya juga dalam urusan perundangan dan perlaksanaannya sesungguhnya bagi manusia itu kebebasan kehormatan kemuliaan yang tidak boleh dicerobohi dalam apa bentuk sekalipun tidak boleh disentuh dalam apa keadaan sekalipun dalam masyarakat islami yang tinggi dan mulia manusia hidup dalam keadaan aman pada diri mereka aman pada rumah mereka aman pada rahsia mereka dan aman pada keaiban mereka tiada sebarang justifikasi atas apa alasan sekali pun untuk mencerobohi kehormatan diri rumah rahsia dan keaiban sekalipun atas pendekatan mencari jenayah atau memastikannya tetap tidak diterima dalam islam pendekatan mengintip orang ramai hukumlah manusia berasaskan apa yang zahir tiada hak sesiapa untuk mencari cari rahsia orang lain seseorang tidak akan diambil tindakan melainkan atas kesalahan dan jenayah yang nyata dari mereka demikianlah nas ini larangan mengintip menempatkan dirinya dalam sistem pelaksanaan dalam masyarakat islami ia bukan sekadar mendidik jiwa dan membersihkan hati bahkan ia telah menjadi dinding yang memagari kehormatan hak dan kebebasan manusia tidak boleh disentuh dari dekat atau jauh atau atas sebarang pendekatan atau nama
4411336 banyak di kalangan ahli kitab yahudi dan nasrani suka kalaulah kiranya mereka dapat mengembalikan kamu menjadi kafir setelah kamu beriman kerana dengki yang timbul dari diri mereka sendiri sesudah nyata kepada mereka kebenaran nabi muhammad s a w oleh itu maafkanlah dan biarkanlah oleh kamu akan mereka sehingga allah datangkan perintah nya sesungguhnya allah maha kuasa atas tiap tiap sesuatu
4411337 bunuhlah yusuf atau buanglah dia ke suatu tempat yang jauh supaya bapa kamu tertumpu kepada kamu semata mata dan kamu sesudah itu menjadi orang orang yang baik

4411340 if we want to beat climate change then we have to stop the destruction of forests and peatlands in indonesia this deal sends a powerful signal to companies around the world that forest protection is becoming a priority in this part of the world we now need to see the same kind of determination from big business when it considers a wider moratorium in november
4411341 kesusahan bagiku dan sia sia lah pekerjaanku menggoda anak adam pada setahun ini dan allah binasakan aku satu saat jua dengan sebab membaca doa ini allah ampunkan dosanya setahun
4411342 telah amanlah anak adam ini daripada godaan pada tahun ini kerana allah telah mewakilkan dua malaikat memeliharanya daripada fitnah syaitan
4411343 dan sesungguhnya kami jadikan untuk neraka jahanam banyak dari jin dan manusia yang mempunyai hati tetapi tidak mahu memahami dengannya dan yang mempunyai mata tetapi tidak mahu melihat dengannya dan yang mempunyai telinga tetapi tidak mahu mendengar dengannya ajaran dan nasihat mereka itu seperti binatang ternak bahkan mereka lebih sesat lagi mereka itulah orang orang yang lalai
4411344 ketahuilah bahawa sesungguhnya mereka itulah orang orang yang sebenar benarnya membuat bencana dan kerosakan tetapi mereka tidak menyedarinya
4411345 patutkah kami ini beriman sebagaimana berimannya orang orang bodoh itu
4411346 dan sesiapa yang menentang ajaran rasulullah sesudah terang nyata kepadanya kebenaran pertunjuk yang dibawanya dan ia pula mengikut jalan yang lain dari jalan orang orang yang beriman kami akan memberikannya kuasa untuk melakukan kesesatan yang dipilihnya dan pada hari akhirat kelak kami akan memasukkannya ke dalam neraka jahanam dan neraka jahanam itu adalah seburuk buruk tempat kembali
4411347 sesungguhnya orang orang yang telah berbalik kepada keingkaran mereka sesudah terang nyata kepada mereka kebenaran petunjuk yang dikemukakan kepadanya syaitanlah yang memperdayakan mereka berlaku demikian serta memanjangkan angan angan mereka
4411348 sebaik baik manusia yang berada pada abadku kemudian generasi berikutnya sampai terdapat kaum kaum di mana syahadat mereka mendahului sumpahnya dan sumpahnya mendahului syahadatnya
4411349 sesungguhnya hal yang paling wajib atas seseorang adalah makrifat terhadap ad deen dan apa apa yang allah bebankan kepada hamba hamba nya berupa pemahaman tauhid terhadap nya sifat sifat nya dan membenarkan utusan utusan nya dengan dalil keyakinan dengan cara istidlal dengan hujah dan penjelasan dan sebaik baik ucapan dan hujah yang rasional adalah al quran dan sabda rasulullah serta perkataan para sahabat kemudian ijma para salaf as soleh dan berpegang teguh terhadap keseluruhannya sampai hari kiamat serta manjauhi berbagai bidah yang diada adakan oleh para penyesat sekalipun hanya mendengarkannya
4411350 wajib bagi kamu untuk mengingkarinya dengan hati janganlah keluar dari ketaatan kepadanya jangan memecah belah barisan muslimin dan jangan menumpahkan darah kaum muslimin fikirkanlah akhir dari perkara ini bersabarlah sehingga orang yang baik boleh tenang dan orang orang jahat berhenti melakukan hal itu keluar dari ketaatan adalah tidak benar dan menyalahi sunnah
4411351 wajib bagi seorang muslim untuk taat dalam hal hal yang dia suka ataupun yang ia benci kecuali kalau diperintah untuk berbuat maksiat maka tidak boleh mendengar dan taat
4411352 ketahuilah barangsiapa yang di bawah seorang wali pemimpin dan ia melihat padanya ada kemaksiatan kepada allah maka hendaklah ia membenci kemaksiatannya akan tetapi janganlah hal ini menyebabkan melepaskan ketaatan kepadanya
4411353 para pembesar kami dari kalangan sahabat rasulullah s a w telah melarang kami tentang beberapa hal jangan mencela menghina pemerintah penguasa jangan menentangnya tapi bersabarlah serta takutlah kamu kepada allah maka sesungguhnya perkara nya itu dekat
4411354 para pembesar dari kalangan sahabat rasulullah saw telah melarang kami mencela menghina penguasa pemerintah
4411355 tidak akan mampu memperbaiki keadaan manusia kecuali penguasa sama ada penguasa yang baik atau yang jahat orang orang bertanya kepadanya wahai amirul mukminin jika penguasa itu baik ini wajar ditaati tetapi bagaimana dengan penguasa yang jahat ali berkata sesungguhnya allah menjaga keamanan suatu daerah melalui perantara penguasa walaupun ia jahat
4411356 bagaimana menghadapai sikap penguasa yang telah menzalimi kita mencela kita dan merampas sadaqah kita bukankah kita harus mencegah mereka
4411357 dan berpeganglah kamu semua kepada tali agama allah dan janganlah kamu bercerai berai
4411358 penguasa adalah naungan allah yang ada di muka bumi apabila dia melakukan ketaatan kepada allah dia akan mendapat pahala dan kamu harus bersyukur apabila dia melakukan kemaksiatan kepada allah maka dia akan mendapat dosa dan kamu harus bersabar janganlah cinta kepada penguasa membuat kamu terjerumus ke dalam kemaksiatan dan kebencian kamu kepadanya membuat kamu keluar dari ketaatan kepadanya
4411359 tidak rosak sesuatu kaum selepas memperolehi petunjuk melainkan setelah mereka suka bermujadalah
4411360 jangan kita tertpengaruh dengan segelintir mereka yang mahu melihat umno hancur dan nasib orang melayu tidak terbela
4411361 if you really really have nothing to do with your time then you should attend the noonday friday prayers at the mosque and listen to the imam lament about the enemies of islam who all have an agenda to destroy islam if not then dont waste your time do something else instead

4411565 with the advent of things like chantix we have a much higher success rate
4411566 i want it to look great for you as well as for myself if they smoke even one cigarette i run the risk of it not healing its like trying to water your lawn with a crimped hose

4411672 i am reserved by nature but i am also very warm to people i do not open up my problems in front of everyone i have my set of close friends so discussing my life with them is enough for me

4411700 we get about 500 to 600 worshippers here on a friday much more than in the past
4411701 what i mean of course is that there are more mosques now the government has never controlled us

4411703 the mosque is far away from the main stadiums too

4411712 recovering from back surgery took longer than i thought although my surgeon tells me he has never known anyone get over that operation as quickly
4411713 there are still times when my body complains at what i am asking it to do but when everything is right my pace is still there and i will only get better with more games
4411714 it would be nice to help groom whoever will eventually replace me in the team but for the moment all my efforts will be going into continuing to take wickets for somerset
4411715 youre just trying to learn whats going on and where to be at
4411716 its a little frustrating but its what you go through when you first start out everybody can relate to that
4411717 my biggest thing is always knowing where you need to be knowing whats going on
4411718 from there you can get the job accomplished its not necessarily easy to go out there and play hard but if you go out there and not know what youre doing you may accidentally make a couple of plays you may accidentally give up some plays more likely youll give up more than you make my thing is if i know what im doing know where im supposed to be hopefully i wont give up too many at all
4411719 it was a little rough i was a little nervous wasnt sure of plays
4411720 now i had a chance to get into the playbook a little bit more i obviously got that first experience out of the way so hopefully i will be a little more comfortable out there
4411721 theres been some times where you see the pass rush ability the raw power
4411722 hes got very strong hands hes got a great ability to control the line of scrimmage and those traits just naturally come out especially in a one on one drill or something where its less processing but you want to see it translate into the game and into the practices it will come
4411723 i started out late but thats something i couldnt control
4411724 once i got here i was focused on what im doing doing some extra meetings doing some extra things on the field and im getting up to speed
4411725 i put a lot of bad guys in jail its time i use my skills to get an innocent one out it wasnt a matter of money its a matter of justice
4411726 at this time of the year every win is huge no matter who you play
4411727 weve not been able to take advantage of teams under 500 this time we really approached them the same way we approached the phillies and the teams in contention
4411728 that second time through the lineup it looked like they made adjustments
4411729 hes got the stuff weve seen it a couple times this year
4411730 thats the way it was tonight he was just executing pitch after pitch hes locating his fastball really well his slider was outstanding
4411731 kuroda was mixing it up throwing sliders and curveballs mixed his fastball in and changed speeds on his fastball trying to keep hitters off balance
4411732 its tough man weve been just in an offensive lull everybodys going out there and trying ive never really been a part of anything like it before
4411733 myers definitely was up to the task but their pitcher was good too
4411734 were all right i mean were a game back if you had asked me if i would take being a game back with 41 to play i would have said yes so theres no sense in us getting all bent out of shape

4411737 arms and collarbones not the head are the most vulnerable parts of the body in a bike accident
4411738 you wouldnt play football or ice hockey without a helmet so why would you ride a bike without one
4411739 cycling is not when people participate in sports there are risks involved
4411740 the medical staff said things would have been much different

4411746 the people are doing their best but the flood was so massive
4411747 many are looking at this as a move to bring the country back to russia
4411748 some people just called me and came to me with a check
4411749 we ask god to help all ukrainians but especially for those who lost everything
4411750 the people are doing their best but the flood was so massive
4411751 many are looking at this as a move to bring the country back to russia

4411753 we ask god to help all ukrainians but especially for those who lost everything
4411754 i can assure the court that my sole motivation in this matter is to fulfill my obligation as a professional engineer and to protect the borough of bloomingdale from the consequences of violation of the state regulations and mandates which it must follow
4411755 jayson fouled it off and it hit him in the eye
4411756 hes in bad shape theres a lot of blood inside and outside of the eye
4411757 im really not in favor of a guy squaring around to hit the ball and a guy throwing it right at his head
4411758 its hard to get out of the way of that pitch
4411759 in my wildest imagination i didnt think they would throw right at his coconut
4411760 they said it was swelling with a lot of bleeding
4411761 no game of baseball is worth that as far as im concerned
4411762 i just dont like it played that way and me losing a player ive lost him probably for the rest of the series
4411763 in the format throwing at guys in that situation to defend the wheel i dont think its the place for it
4411764 today a guy who owns a sport team is somebody who has generated a big pile of money in some other industry and its very likely that their primordial financial interests and instincts are rooted in that other industry
4411765 once the primary season was over the battle ax was buried and we became one team
4411766 i dont think theres any correlation between being a sports owner and supporting i think theres a correlation between being a businessman and supporting john mccain
4411767 although i have business issues and i have differences with sen obama on some tax issues thats overridden by my commitment to what i believe he will contribute to the overall good of the country
4411768 some nba owners are republicans some nba owners are democrats
4411769 but one thing they have in common is theyre all businessmen
4411770 we have a policy that if any season ticket holder runs for president of the united states we are going to support him
4411771 that choice will end his bid for the presidency and spell defeat for other republican candidates
4411772 hes not even sure christian conservatives would vote for him let alone work for him if he picked a pro abortion running mate
4411773 a good portion of us were urging him to pick a pro life running mate
4411774 that choice would go a long way to solidify his credentials
4411775 wrong headed short sighted fracture the democratic partys fracture right now
4411776 if he does that it makes our job 100 times harder it would dampen enthusiasm at a time when evangelicals are looking for ways to gin up enthusiasm
4411777 some people in the movement say it would be the kiss of death he heard that in the room last night
4411778 youre going to have to have a huge turnout of that base again for mccain to win
4411779 ninety percent of the workforce for bush in 04 came out of that constituency
4411780 picking a ridge or a joseph lieberman would not be helpful at all
4411781 the point that mccain was making is that people can differ on one issue and still be a vital member of our party
4411782 the fact that governor ridge is not perfectly in line with the does not make him any less of a republican
4411783 the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the
4411784 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out for vice president
4411785 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that
4411786 this move to a pro choice running mate such as lieberman could help reshape his message to appeal to swing voters
4411787 the right wing is not going anywhere and choice is a key issue for over 40 women who voted for hillary in the primaries
4411788 a lot of the troops here are on the fence or disappointed
4411789 for i am one and one alone love lover beloved mirror beauty eye
4411790 the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer my god my strength in whom i will trust i will call upon the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall i be saved from my enemies

4411812 mit der romantischen honeymoon zeit ist es jetzt nat rlich vorbei jetzt da die erste verliebtheit verflogen ist nervt man sich auch mal gegenseitig
4411813 seit monaten werden b se ger chte ber die ehe gestreut sarah und marc ist es zu bl d darauf zu reagieren das ist alles unsinn
4411814 diese frau ist ganz bewusst auf marc angesetzt worden obwohl die ganze familie auf mallorca an diesem abend dabei war diese dame wollte wohl unbedingt in die ffentlichkeit das hat sie ja geschafft mehr aber auch nicht solche frauen gibt es immer

4411818 the one thing you wonder about is the durability hes got to understand that 20 plays into 2004 ricky santos had to take somebodys place thats why backup kevin deckers got to feel like hes the starter and theres going to be competition
4411819 me and r j played together freshman year so im used to him
4411820 hes a very good quarterback so its easy for the receivers to adjust and its easy for r j to adjust were a tight team
4411821 it has all the makings of a real good line
4411822 were all trying to get the chemistry this camp so we can work well heading into the season
4411823 somewhere along the line out of those seven or eight guys weve got to get four guys who can start and others who can come in and play
4411824 were going to try to do what we did two years ago with dan wagner brendan st peter and marvin wright inside and on the outside trying to get three of them in a rotation
4411825 the opener is definitely going to fly by and be here before we know it
4411826 but the key is you cant look ahead 3 weeks youve got to focus on getting better and better day by day
4411827 he will continue as our full partner in control of ua
4411828 he is in the middle of one of the greatest careers our industry has ever seen and one that will continue at the top of united artists entertainment
4411829 as close to a certainty as youre going to get
4411830 we take into account things like dales audition tape in which he was derogatory about women and behaviour in the house things that the punters see as well and that really forms our opinion
4411831 i think when dale originally went up he was about 1 6 and then it was one way traffic 90 to 95 of all bets were on dale that explains the 1 100 price
4411832 if a lot of money comes in for one person they go shorter and shorter and shorter while the other goes out and out hopefully attracting people to bet on it
4411833 we now dread the weekly eviction as we are losing money every week punters are filling their boots
4411834 what happens to a large extent is quite a lot of people make money week in week out on the short priced favourites and then you put the whole lot on what looked like a certainty for the twins
4411835 a good bookmaker should break even when the favourite wins and then when the upset happens should make a lot of money
4411836 if you can get 1 10 a 10 increase on your money when the guy is virtually definitely going then thats a good price
4411837 its virtually risk free some of these are virtually risk free
4411838 but some of them arent and in the first weeks eviction mario was 1 10 and he stayed against steph

4411855 me and r j played together freshman year so im used to him
4411856 hes a very good quarterback so its easy for the receivers to adjust and its easy for r j to adjust were a tight team
4411857 it has all the makings of a real good line
4411858 were all trying to get the chemistry this camp so we can work well heading into the season
4411859 somewhere along the line out of those seven or eight guys weve got to get four guys who can start and others who can come in and play
4411860 were going to try to do what we did two years ago with dan wagner brendan st peter and marvin wright inside and on the outside trying to get three of them in a rotation
4411861 the opener is definitely going to fly by and be here before we know it
4411862 but the key is you cant look ahead 3 weeks youve got to focus on getting better and better day by day

4411864 in the second quarter of 2008 bingo com made some important strides towards returning to profitability

4411866 to win a medal wasnt in my wildest dreams something i didnt think i would achieve
4411867 to be in the top two has completely blown me away im so glad to have got the silver im not disappointed at all
4411868 i was so focused today i didnt even look at the semi final result i just needed to know that i was through
4411869 its one of the reasons why we made some of the choices we made like when we pulled out the potion system
4411870 when we wanted to add a hot bar we knew we had to pull the potion stuff out every time we add something we have to pull something out to keep the game very simple and straightforward to play
4411871 was the player was faster than most of the monsters and had pretty much infinite health because they would just pop as many potions as they wanted so when you have a player who has more mobility more health and endless power essentially the only thing you can really do to challenge the players is to kill them by just spiking the difficulty
4411872 when the player has similar downsides it means we can make a lot more interesting monsters we dont have to kill you to challenge you we can make a monster that affects your mobility we can make a monster that has different kinds of attacks that are dangerous to you and that you actually have to avoid and so it makes the combat a lot more interesting
4411873 we cannot compete with china in terms of cost and bulk for basic products
4411874 but we can hold our own when it comes to producing customized yarns for clients whose needs we take care of
4411875 we know will do our product justice we sell a service not a yarn
4411876 a cross between a literary journal a d i y zine and a farmers almanac
4411877 topics range from the personal to the political to the spiritual and back again the contents of the charis review like the contributors are multi generational and are sourced from all over the south
4411878 were thrilled to have a piece by dorothy she has a relationship with charis and has had one for a long time
4411879 for the most part the charis review has been a labor of love elizabeth and i both have high hopes for this project and we have both given a great deal of our free time to make it happen
4411880 that said we are both on the charis circle payroll and this project is absolutely an extension of the charis circle mission and vision charis circle exists to foster sustainable feminist communities work for social justice and encourage the expression of diverse and marginalized voices
4411881 the charis review does all of those things and the organization is proud to launch this new endeavor we are fairly confident that the magazine will raise enough money to pay for itself
4411882 because there were only two of us working on the project as editors we decided not to do an open call for the first issue instead we invited specific artists and writers in our community to submit work
4411883 all of the contributors in the first issue are tied to charis in some way either through direct involvement or just through community for the next issue there will be an open call for submissions and we hope to get a broad response from our communities
4411884 its the first time that ive actually been able to figure out how to make my standup into a sitcom format which is totally unusual and totally different
4411885 its like a sitcom but with real people its kind of a different take on what is reality but what is comedy so its comedy but its also very real and different
4411886 he does give us a degree of flexibility as well because in the under 18s hes been playing back hes been playing in the midfield and has been able to go forward and be a strong contributor up there as well
4411887 im comfortable with him playing in all three areas of the ground one of the reasons he was selected was because of that flexibility
4411888 im not even going to waste my time trying to control that i dont want to even try and control the expectation that has always been there
4411889 probably each week it will be a discussion point whether we go with patrick
4411890 that general concept lets give them at least two i dont think it necessarily fits

4411900 various achievements are very heartening to all of us but we must continue to heighten our vigilance
4411901 this is the first picture of a clay sized particle on mars and the size agrees with predictions from the colors seen in sunsets on the red planet
4411902 we are now ready to start doing scientific experiments that will add a new dimension to measurements being made by other phoenix lander instruments
4411903 lost boys was a massive part of my life it still is you cant crap on that

4411905 that was joels idea and i thought that was really cool but apparently joel was really busy warner bros was really busy and it didnt happen
4411906 saya katakan konvensional karena pemerintah mengambil kebijakan defisit dalam rapbn
4411907 jika presiden berani mengubah pola anggaran defisit menjadi berimbang meski baru dalam rapbn itu sudah dapat dinilai sebagai prestasi karena berani keluar dari kebijakan anggaran yang konvensional
4411908 pemerintah sebenarnya tidak perlu takut untuk menyeimbangkan antara belanja dan penerimaan karena dalam jangka panjang pola anggaran yang defisit hanya akan merugikan rakyat
4411909 kan sudah dua kali tidak hadir ya menurut yang bersangkutan sih karena tugas negara
4411910 politik itu kalau bukan kampanye apa kampanye oleh pemerintah artinya berbuat apa yang sudah dilakukan sementara kampanye bukan pemerintah pidatonya akan ini akan itu kalau pemerintah apa yang telah dan apa yang akan dilanjutkan wajar saja apa yang salah
4411911 bukan itu pencitraan menjelaskan apa adanya bahwa kemudian citranya baik itulah hasil bekerja selama empat tahun ini
4411912 selalu mengkritik hanya berpikir soal kemiskinan yang susah susah sehingga indonesia sepertinya neraka

4411916 in reality this project has no relation to the iranian missile threat but is aimed against russia
4411917 this is an important agreement for the security of the united states for the security of poland and the security of our nato allies
4411918 we are travelling to south africa with president robert mugabe today as the negotiations continue
4411919 the talks never collapsed and all parties are committed to the dialogue i would also want to confirm commitment to see the talks end successfully sooner rather than later
4411920 we cannot continue wandering around without direction hence the need to swear in parliamentarians and open the house so that the elected members can continue to fulfil their constitutional mandate
4411921 karena di situ ada beberapa hal yang menjadi ciri ciri pidato politik seperti yang lazim ada di negara negara maju
4411922 memang betul pengangguran bisa diturunkan sampai segitu tapi itu karena bps sangat kreatif dalam melaksanakan definisi definisi pengumpulan datanya
4411923 untuk pendataan sekarang ini karena ada keinginan untuk segera menurunkan angka pengangguran maka itu semua diuber atau didata
4411924 ini tidak yang dulu tidak ada sekarang dimasukkan demikian juga dengan tingkat kemiskinan ada kreativitas untuk meningkatkan definisi di lapangan sehingga terlihat penurunan angka kemiskinan yang sedemikian drastis
4411925 kalau ditanya punya data pembandingnya atau tidak tentu jawabannya tidak karena untuk mencari data tersebut perlu ratusan miliar dan kalaupun punya uang sebesar itu lebih baik digunakan untuk lainnya
4411926 jangan jangan ada laporan yang menyebabkan presiden berani mengatakan demikian
4411927 god said let us father son and holy spirit make mankind in our image after our likeness and let them have complete authority over the fish in the sea the birds of the air the tame beasts and over all the earth and over everything that creeps upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image and likeness of god he created him
4411928 a mans moral self shall be filled with the fruit of his mouth and with the consequence of his words he must be satisfied whether good or evil death and life are in the power of the tongue and they who indulge in it shall eat the fruit of it for death or life
4411929 benefits of taking action on climate change in our province far outweigh the costs of not acting
4411930 our results suggest that global surface temperature may not increase over the next decade as natural climate variations in the north atlantic and tropical pacific temporarily offset the projected anthropogenic warming
4411931 the outlook abroad is more than usually gloomy storms floods and hurricanes seem to be completing the devastation which unseasonable weather began in the united states and canada the heat is unusually severe and numerous deaths are already reported by sunstroke this early in the season
4411932 in europe this year 1879 so far has been unusually disastrous and there has been large losses of life and property by flood and fire we have had the most distressing accounts of the floods in hungary and elsewhere the eruption of mount etna the ravages of life by plague subsequent to the turco russian war the famine pestilence in india and now comes the prospect of cholera in russia
4411933 i guess if we had a leaning at all its cap and trade
4411934 right now we have the second lowest emissions among provinces and we are undertaking other green initiatives to ensure we tackle the global issue
4411935 in the end the 13 leaders decided to focus on lowering energy costs and overall demand committing to a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency by 2020 from coast to coast thats 12 years from now and just 20 per cent
4411936 this was a policy disagreement i had with administrator johnson who is in a very difficult situation
4411937 i respect the administrator though i do disagree with the policies he has pursued
4411938 i was invited back to epa to do a job and i did all this administration wanted me to do this administration has declined to decide what to do about the profound policy challenge of global warming this administration has decided to make itself irrelevant
4411939 i do not know what motivated him to say that he suddenly realized that this administration wasnt going to do anything
4411940 nobody knows for sure why he went public and started ratting out his colleagues
4411941 he was one of the political insiders at epa people on staff at epa are stunned that hes trying to rewrite history and say that he was a good guy all along
4411942 while he and i ultimately didnt agree on the right way to set an air quality standard
4411943 he liked how i operated he liked my expertise and experience in applying economic analysis to environmental policy making
4411944 it will have legal significance requiring epa to then issue the first federal greenhouse gas regulations i believe that much of the work we did will help the next administration
4411945 it was environmentally bad and flagrantly illegal on its face
4411946 he came into a lot of ill repute at the agency during the mercury battles
4411947 he was one of the principle architects for a policy that proved to be a total disaster from an air pollution standpoint
4411948 my basic philosophy of the regulation is fairly straight forward
4411949 some regulations are quite beneficial to the well being of our country and some of them arent ive tried to apply a consistent set of principles to each inquiry
4411950 was that administrator johnson declined to provide a stronger soot standard
4411951 california has met the test of the clean air act
4411952 sure hes giving corroboration that the leader of epa is a scoundrel
4411953 but whats being done about it the career epa staff people have been keeping their heads down for seven years they figure they might as well keep them down for another five months
4411954 because hes confirming what many of us have known for years that bush and cheney have been especially disastrous on environmental matters
4411955 the floods we experienced last year caused untold misery both emotional and financial for hundreds of families and the council and other government agencies must make sure this never happens again
4411956 our requests are simple erect flood defences where the rivers broke their banks dredge the rivers and clear them of rubbish on a regular basis
4411957 it is vital that we join together to ensure that flood prevention remains high on the councils agenda and at the forefront of peoples minds across the region

4411969 its been three months since javaone and the success of lwuit has surpassed our wildest expectations as a result many mobile developers including major commercial companies have already committed to using lwuit for their upcoming projects clearly lwuit has struck a nerve
4411970 this is a woman who not so long ago was short on confidence and motivation and didnt want to play it just goes to show that with support and confidence things can turn around very quickly
4411971 new hampshire residents like americans everywhere have come to realize the importance of accessing domestic supply
4411972 for years they have relied on easily accessible sources of oil and natural gas to run their cars heat their homes and cook their food but the current situation is making everyday energy use a difficult proposition for many in the granite state
4411973 congress needs to acknowledge current day realities and lift the ban on domestic drilling
4411974 the burden of high gasoline costs is weighing heavily on the minds of new hampshire residents
4411975 and congress can address their concerns by bringing forth a balanced energy policy that includes the development of domestic oil and natural gas along with measures to encourage conservation efficiency and greater supplies of other forms of energy

4411990 i was starting a business in the city and wanted to meet people
4411991 i have met a lot of great people over the years and enjoyed working with the chamber

4412012 what happened on the night of august 7 is beyond comprehension
4412013 the georgian military attacked the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali with multiple rocket launchers designed to devastate large areas
4412014 russia had to respond to accuse it of aggression against small defenseless georgia is not just hypocritical but shows a lack of humanity
4412015 nevertheless it was still possible to find a political solution clearly the only way to solve the south ossetian problem on that basis is through peaceful means the georgian leadership flouted this key principle
4412016 av its almost impossible to increase our freakiness were already too freaky

4412022 the tssa has been far more receptive and responsive than most to consumer advice and input
4412023 theres also this very profound kind of blurring of whos responsible when things go wrong and i think weve seen some of that in the last few days
4412024 i dont think these organizations would have been able to undertake the type of regulatory work they do without this type of model
4412025 im very disappointed for a professional organization like the tssa i would have expected they would have reliable and accurate information they could report to the public

4412042 our goal in south asia is to seek a peaceful stable and prosperous neighbourhood
4412043 we seek to accelerate the pace of social and economic development in our country and our region while safeguarding our national security our foreign policy has been based on these principles
4412044 the recent blasts in our embassy in kabul have cast a shadow over our efforts to normalize relations with pakistan and to bring a lasting and honourable peace in our region
4412045 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4412046 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take
4412047 the terrorists and those who support them are enemies of the people of india and pakistan of friendship between the two countries and of peace in the region and the world we must defeat them
4412048 strengthened our relations with the major powers latin american countries arab countries and african countries

4412055 they go wherever they want without a look for people around them
4412056 if we had tried to do this on the fly my concern was that it could turn into some very messy public event
4412057 the dollars continuing uptrend is a key factor depressing commodities in general and triggering heavy sales in gold
4412058 japanese players are dumping their long term positions after breaking through key levels this week the market may be oversold but the market is still in a downward trend
4412059 its still early to say its the end of the super cycle but if the markets continue to fall like they are doing now i am sure many people will be talking about it very soon
4412060 the region around 750 is very important because this is a long term gold uptrend support so if its broken golds really gone
4412061 well have some people targeting 750 but i think we would need to see a continuation in that dollar strength to give it sufficient momentum to head that way
4412062 near term support should be around 12 38 then 12 00s
4412063 on a more bearish note we could in fact head all the way down to 11 50s because the long term uptrend seems to be breached as of todays sharp downward movement
4412064 these visits also help us know how many mexican nationals are living abroad in our consulate jurisdiction
4412065 expert presenters will discuss a wide range of topics from pain management to debt counseling and stress relief

4412072 the information we are all giving to online companies is massive and dangerous and securitys going to get worse before it gets better
4412073 our belief is that with the right technology the new generation of cloud computing system can be made as secure if not more secure than existing server based office systems

4412075 tbc banks new branch directly expresses the concept included in the banks slogan my bank is on my side clients and the staff are seen side by side making decisions together
4412076 the effect of the outcome of the 2007 kcse has largely contributed to the recent unrests in schools
4412077 it is strange that both the ps and the minister are telling kenyans that they have banned holiday tuition yet it had been done several years ago only that no circulars had been sent out

4412084 as close to a certainty as youre going to get
4412085 we take into account things like dales audition tape in which he was derogatory about women and behaviour in the house things that the punters see as well and that really forms our opinion
4412086 i think when dale originally went up he was about 1 6 and then it was one way traffic 90 to 95 of all bets were on dale that explains the 1 100 price
4412087 if a lot of money comes in for one person they go shorter and shorter and shorter while the other goes out and out hopefully attracting people to bet on it
4412088 we now dread the weekly eviction as we are losing money every week punters are filling their boots
4412089 what happens to a large extent is quite a lot of people make money week in week out on the short priced favourites and then you put the whole lot on what looked like a certainty for the twins
4412090 a good bookmaker should break even when the favourite wins and then when the upset happens should make a lot of money
4412091 if you can get 1 10 a 10 increase on your money when the guy is virtually definitely going then thats a good price
4412092 its virtually risk free some of these are virtually risk free
4412093 but some of them arent and in the first weeks eviction mario was 1 10 and he stayed against steph

4412102 i am very happy to make the contract a year longer im really happy to be here and proud to be a part of aston villa
4412103 i wanted to stay longer and the club wanted me to sign the new deal so it has worked out well im satisfied and hopefully the club is satisfied
4412104 i love the club i love the fans the team is a great group of players and of course the manager is a great great manager so the future looks bright and i just want to be a part of it
4412105 jeromes a young player that harry redknapp has always liked a quick wide player who is a good addition to the squad
4412106 the idea is that he comes here and proves himself if he plays to the ability we all know he has then he has a great chance of staying here longer so its in his hands

4412109 it cant be open ended either geographically or in time
4412110 it has to be circumscribed and its got to be in the context of the russians withdrawing all their armed forces

4412113 our margins continue to improve as the cost of our largest raw material milk continues to decrease from its record highs set in the fall of 2007
4412114 we intend on using the extra savings derived from these lower raw material prices to increase our marketing and promotional activities and to continue to educate the public as to the benefits of our kefir
4412115 we are working with north wales to see if we can put in place a development region and we have to explore other opportunities in wales as well
4412116 we are delighted to further extend our partnership with tna wrestling through our entertaining programming and innovative promotional efforts we will build tna wrestling in the indian subcontinent and with this new contract we are bringing in many more interactive and engaging opportunities for wrestling fans in south asia we are confident that fans will fully enjoy this unique experience
4412117 we have been taken off guard by the sheer inventiveness of our customers
4412118 some are going to take advantage of professional development for their teams others have approached us with plans to bring sponsors and rights holders together and use 360 as part of an education and networking programme whilst others are talking about arranging private screenings to the entire sports marketing industry in their city
4412119 we were attracted by the chance to bring some sophistication to our local market and sports marketing 360 will really give us the chance to do that to bring key figures from fifa octagon havas sports amp entertainment hsbc and carlsberg to our town just isnt going to happen but 360 gets them in front of us and our clients and we can get our questions answered
4412120 rugby expo is about strengthening the game on a global scale and the states is an untapped market with massive potential for growth both commercially and popularity wise
4412121 jonathans knowledge of the game is second to none and this benefits rugby expo hugely as he has vast experience of both rugby league and union the number of high profile rugby figures that give backing to our cross code event rises daily and its fantastic to have someone of jonathans stature in the team we look forward to working with both him and dan
4412122 im pushing hard to try and make the difference as soon as i can the feeling with the tyres is very good and now im 15 seconds ahead of mikko hirvonen so everything is okay
4412123 its been a good morning but sebastien is really fast
4412124 im trying as hard as i can but in this stage ss3 i was way too careful
4412125 to be honest i already spend quite a lot of time between the races analysing the data and keeping fit this summer break gave me the opportunity to get away from that and focus on just recharging my batteries looking back at the season so far it feels like a different championship compared to last year 2007 was very intense and consistency was incredibly important this year everybodys results have been more varied and every driver who has won a race has also failed to score on at least two other occasions thats made getting strong results even more important but i think well see consistency becoming crucial as we head towards the end of the season
4412126 we launched the vodafone mclaren mercedes team in the city at the start of 2007 and ive tested at the ricardo tormo circuit so the city isnt unfamiliar to me anyway going to a new circuit doesnt really change my preparations everybodys in the same situation so i dont treat things very differently of course weve done some preparation back at the mclaren technology centre ahead of this race but our main focus will still be the three free practice sessions ahead of qualifying ill be working closely with my engineers to make sure we start the weekend with a good baseline and work hard to strengthen it as we go through the weekend i enjoy visiting new racetracks and im looking forward to getting into the cockpit on friday morning it looks like being an amazing track
4412127 im wary of making predictions the race in hungary showed just how unpredictable formula one can be and thats one of the reasons why its such a fascinating sport clearly though i am still in a good position to challenge for the world championship and that remains my aim we still feel confident about our chances we know our rivals will be strong but weve worked hard to improve the car and are confident well be competitive this weekend the most important thing is to finish consistently in the points
4412128 i had very much a working holiday i spent some time in woking with my engineers preparing for this weekend and i also spent some time back in finland at my home town of suomussalmi where i help organise an annual karting event in the town obviously having just won the most recent grand prix made it a fantastic event for everybody it was my first time back in finland for quite a long time too so it was great to turn up as a grand prix winner
4412129 the win doesnt change too much really i still believe i am improving and learning more about the team and the car at each race my aim for the last part of the season is to win more races and to perform regularly at the front its something i was able to do from time to time in the first half of the year but i now feel more confident that i can be a consistent challenger in the remaining races and im really looking forward to that
4412130 it looks pretty fast to be honest you get used to street circuits being quite slow with lots of slow to medium speed corners and very short straights but this is almost the opposite there are a lot of fast kinks and esses a couple of decent straights and lots of high speed stuff its too early to say yet whether there will be opportunities to overtake around here but there are a couple of hairpins where it might be possible
4412131 in terms of car set up we need to remember that like monaco the track will be both green and dusty on the opening day of practice that sometimes tempts you into playing with set up more than you would like so you need to resist that temptation and let the track come to the car our simulations suggest well employ a downforce level similar to that of hockenheim but the individual demands of the track may push that window up or down finally anybody whos studied any onboard footage of the circuit will be mindful of the proximity of the concrete barriers in certain areas clearly well be packing plenty of spares but hoping we wont need to use them
4412132 the most important thing is to be thorough methodical and iterative although we arrive at a new racetrack having undertaken a huge amount of research and armed with an enormous amount of data the reality is that its really only the starting point for our engineering team we begin friday practice the way we would at any other circuit but in this instance we need to pay particular attention both to driver feedback and the data generated from the car the important thing is not to react too hastily its vital that you dont end up going down the wrong path because you only have a limited amount of time to tune the set up before qualifying
4412133 clearly spain has become a tremendously important market for formula 1 over the past five years and the addition of a second spanish race to the calendar rightly reflects the sports success and popularity in the market
4412134 everything weve seen about the city and the organisation of this event leads me to believe it will be a fantastic success and set a new standard for formula 1 more importantly it marks a return to city racing something we will also witness in singapore and next year in abu dhabi and thats something that really engages the people and fans far more than at a purpose built circuit out of town this is an important time for the growth of the sport and everybody at vodafone mclaren mercedes will be hoping the weekend is a fantastic success both for the team itself and the sport as a whole
4412135 lewis heikki and the entire team performed excellently achieving three race wins in a row since the beginning of the previous season we have won 13 out of 28 races and if possible we want to improve this success rate however the maiden race in valencia will be a new game for everybody
4412136 when you think about temporary street races in formula 1 you mainly think about monaco however valencia does not have very much in common with this classic race just that both cities are located on the mediterranean coast and that both circuits lead along the harbour front while the monte carlo race is the slowest of the year with an average speed of about 156km h for the fastest lap and is also the shortest with a race distance of almost 254km we face a race distance of 310 km in valencia and a track on which the cars will reach 300km h or more five times per lap three times per lap the drivers also have to brake to about 80km h which will be as extremely demanding for the brakes as the montreal circuit the longest full throttle section will be along the harbour where the drivers will drive at full throttle for 13 sec the front straight is 185 metres long and the shortest of all formula 1 circuits this year we calculated an average speed per lap of 225km h which will be the eighth fastest of all grand prix tracks this is not typical for a street race it is more like a version of silverstone or monza but located in a city

4412154 my father my brother and all the men in my family are over 6 feet so that is what i am used to
4412155 i am short and i am looking for a man to father my children and i dont want to have short children
4412156 i just feel safer when i walk down the street with a man who is much taller than me
4412157 i am only attracted to tall men i just cant help it
4412158 you realize that if you are talking about growing old with a man most people shrink a couple of inches as they hit old age
4412159 well if hes going to shrink all the more reason to only meet someone very tall

4412165 the last supreme court term which ended in june was the stormiest in recent memory with more 5 to 4 decisions split along ideological lines than at any time in the courts history in a series of controversial cases about abortion racial integration in schools faith based programs and the death penalty the courts four more conservative justices prevailed with justice anthony m kennedy providing the crucial fifth vote
4412166 i am disappointed the federal government will not be assisting the many new hampshire families impacted by this severe weather and we will be asking that the decision not to include individual assistance be reviewed
4412167 the declaration fails to adequately address the damage inflicted by the tornado and fails to fully cover those impacted by this disaster which has only been worsened by subsequent rain and flooding
4412168 the severity and breadth of the disaster led gov lynch to request that all five impacted counties be declared disaster areas and that fema provide both public and individual assistance
4412169 ready to work with local state and federal officials in that effort

4412218 sabbath pointed to jesus christ and his finished work upon the cross it is finished
4412219 remember the sabbath day to keep it holy 6 days shalt thou labor and do all thy work but the 7th day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates for in 6 days the lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that in them is and rested the 7th day wherefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it
4412220 gal5 4 if you try to be saved by following the law you are fallen from grace we didnt write it it is in hte bible there is no salvation in the law if there were jesus died in vain
4412221 the solution for you is to accept the lordship of jesus christ and follow him instead of mosaic laws
4412222 if you believe they form the right template you should after all these people were jewish followed the mosaic law
4412223 you should take yourself amp male children down to the temple for circumcision
4412224 it doesnt matter which day of the week you attend church

4412226 denise the 7day week was instituted along with the 7th day sabbath at creation and not in the 3rd century
4412227 the bible states on the seventh day he rose from the dead it does not read on the seventh day of the week he rose
4412228 in addition since the seven day week did not come into common use until the third century a d how are you so certain you have the correct day
4412229 with the changes of the calendar over the centuries and the possibility of miscalculating
4412230 christ will never turn away anyone who comes to him and he will write his law upon our hearts so that we obey out of love for him
4412231 how is it possible for us to turn away from christ
4412232 i have achieved it and god was happy with what i achieved
4412233 god did it in me and i am grateful that he overruled my falleness to do it
4412234 i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me
4412235 for it is god who is at work in you
4412236 i have achieved it and god was happy with what i achieved
4412237 if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us
4412238 alas how many there are today who imagine that if they have
4412239 but he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it and is not forgetful hearer but a doer of the work these one will be blessed in what he does
4412240 even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone
4412241 thou believest that there is 1 god thou doest well the devils also believe and tremble but wilt thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead
4412242 whosoever abideth in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth hath not seen him neither known him
4412243 whoseover committeth sin transgresseth also the law for sin is the transgression of the law
4412244 a minority of humnity that has remained faithful to the lord in every age since the fall of adam
4412245 and if by grace then it is no longer of works otherwise grace is no longer grace
4412246 but he answered and said unto them why do ye also transgress the commandment entole of god by your tradition for god commanded saying honor thy father and mother
4412247 and they rested the sabbath day according to the commandment entole
4412248 and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him
4412249 the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses

4412251 all those who take the sword will perish by the sword
4412252 christ himself never condemned one for being a soldier and what do soldiers do but kill an enemy if necessary
4412253 do not intimidate anyone or accuse falsely and be content with your wages
4412254 there is all this angst about fighting islamic terrorists who kill untold numbers of innocent people each year

4412259 the blessed virgin with special devotion from the most ancient times the blessed virgin has been honored with the title of mother of god this very special devotion differs essentially from the adoration which is given to the incarnate word and equally to the father and the holy spirit and greatly fosters this adoration
4412260 the blessed mother of our lord jesus christ is dead
4412261 actually when we pray to mary we know that we are not praying to god

4412264 how many of you think that the president has the power to stop abortion
4412265 but i have to say that what i notice is much more anti obama post than anti bush mccain
4412266 bush says hes a christian did abortion stop no it appears that it has been left up to individual states of course this taking of life is a sad issue but not the only one that matters in this election ss health care ending this war just to name a few
4412267 opposes the pro life amendment favored by reese and favors leaving up to a woman and her doctor the abortion question
4412268 abortion is a matter best left to a woman and her doctor
4412269 barbara you claim to be a christian has abortion stopped is it up to one individual or a bunch not willing to take responsibility for their actions
4412270 if you dont like the ungodly programing then change the channel
4412271 i have to weigh all the issues before making a decision bush says hes a christian did abortion stop no it appears that it has been left up to individual states of course this taking of life is a sad issue but not the only one that matters in this election ss health care ending this war just to name a few abortion has been happening and will continue to do so whether legally or back alley as it has since early times
4412272 elder i am surprised at you referring to the members of the democratic party as
4412273 our father is getting old and there is not a man on earth to unite us as was the custm everywhere come let us ply our father with wine and then lie with him that we may have offspring by our father
4412274 is it okay to drink alcohol moderately without getting drunk
4412275 woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine and men of strength to mingle strong drink
4412276 wine is a mocker strong drink is raging and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise
4412277 give strong drink to them that are ready to perish and wine unto those that be of a heavy heart let him drink and forget his poverty and remember his misery no more
4412278 this is not a mind set game if you want to be a genuine player

4412281 no john 6 51 i am the living bread that came down from heaven whoever eats this bread will live forever and the bread that i will give is my flesh for the life of the world
4412282 my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink
4412283 then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you

4412286 each one must give as he has made up his mind not reluctantly or under compulsion for god loves a cheerful giver

4412289 if boeing would like to develop a successor to the 737 we would like to partner them at the lower end of the aircraft perhaps in the 100 to 130 seat segment

4412297 there is a reason why they imported a german guy to the us
4412298 they need to understand the international business and then bring our know how to that business to create new content
4412299 there are a lot of emerging markets that now have an experienced workforce and it is a lot cheaper to produce in those places because of lower below the line costs

4412308 in terms of prevention our findings indicate that consistently sleeping around 7 hours per night is optimal for health and a sustained reduction may predispose to ill health
4412309 obviously theres some variation some people intrinsically need more sleep than others a few people skip by successfully long term getting less sleep but thats a very small number

4412426 still using repossession as the first rather than last resort
4412427 every day shelter is seeing more and more ordinary hardworking people who are terrified of losing their homes theyre being punished by rising household bills escalating fuel charges and food prices that are going through the roof
4412428 tens of thousands are living with the fear of having the home theyve worked so hard for being repossessed by lenders with little compassion
4412429 lenders must play their part and ensure they look at all the options before rushing to the court and use repossession as the last rather than first option
4412430 the government needs to show it really is on peoples side when they are facing the threat of repossession
4412431 whilst we are not seeing repossessions on the same scale as the early 1990s we are making sure the right advice and support is available for the minority of borrowers who may need it at the moment because of global economic pressures
4412432 as well as expanding free legal representation in county courts for households at risk of repossession we are providing more free debt advice and are working closely with lenders to ensure that repossession is only ever a last resort
4412433 these services can make a real difference with more than 80 of repossessions avoided when they are used it is important that families who have concerns seek advice at the earliest opportunity starting by speaking to their lender

4412504 we should have moved the union pacific railroad tracks more than a year ago
4412505 i am going to reclaim my title there is no two ways about it i want it back and i will get it back
4412506 mabuza is not a nightmare for us we are just worried about the title and this time taks is in a better shape and frame of mind to take it back and keep it for good
4412507 to feel the pain from the powerful punches of taks
4412508 my boxer is confident and the nation will see his fantastic boxing skills come saturday
4412509 ladies and gentlemen please do not cry out during play thank you
4412510 ladies and gentlemen in the spirit of the olympics please do applaud errors made by the athletes and as a courtesy to the athletes please maintain silence during the action
4412511 you dont compete there in 2012 in london theyre not going to spend that much money
4412512 i hope he enjoyed this as much as i did
4412513 but i believed she wasnt second we made mistakes and we werent ready
4412514 parents need to trust that they can send their child to school and day care without worrying that they could be harmed by a convicted sex offender
4412515 it was always my plan to do deals its what i love doing
4412516 i had to get vision right and with the hilden deal done i think i can now begin to look at the next stage
4412517 turnover should be around 40m this year and while ill obviously still be involved in vision and in the integration of hilden ill then look at the fund raising
4412518 there are four institutions fairly interested hopefully the hilden deal will help it get off the ground i havent set a formal deadline as such but id like to have it done by christmas
4412519 im pretty happy with what we have got in vision now though i am looking to add to the mix of customers on the retail side at the moment
4412520 the business climate is tough but i believe the funding is there for the right deal at the right price i dont see a quick end to the downturn i think were maybe still at the beginning rather than the end
4412521 we have done a lot of meetings with various groups and we dont expect everyone to agree with everything we say but we really do expect business organisations to be serious participants in the debate
4412522 they basically said as a matter of principle they would regard it better for their members to sit in traffic because of congestion than look at the alternatives we did not regard them as serious people they did not come up with any alternatives
4412523 we are not interested in a war of words and far happier to work with people to achieve a mutually acceptable solution however sir howards dismissive opinion of the federation is not helping the matter
4412524 while the comparisons against us were softer than of late that in no way detracted from the strength of the performance given the extremely challenging trading conditions we are in
4412525 the second week of strong positives in the electricals department should boost the electrical specialists while the ongoing weaker trend at waitrose is a pointer of weaker sales at m amp s on food
4412526 the firm has completed a successful year due to the support of our clients and hard work of a talented staff
4412527 however we anticipate that the coming months will be difficult for all businesses
4412528 asda is gaining market share at the fastest rate in many years
4412529 our overall pricing is healthy but rising costs continue to put pressure on our margins
4412530 the accountancy sector is a hugely important part of the local economy it employs 18 000 people in the north west and around half of those are based in greater manchester
4412531 although the big four are more high profile 85 per cent of people work in small and medium sized firms
4412532 when we are talking to global banks with a view to them investing in the city the strength of the existing professional services sector is very very important
4412533 ten years ago we were an audit firm which had some tax and advisory services the enron situation made all firms invest in tax and advisory and other services now
4412534 look at the really big corporate deals of recent years the 1bn plus caudwell sale being a good example it was done out of manchester by manchester professionals a decade ago i think businesses thought they had to go to london for advice because they wanted the best i dont think it is the case any more
4412535 manchester is very much a place where professionals recognise they need to be and that is clearly a good thing
4412536 weve also broadened our service offerings and our client base so that more than half our revenues now come from clients that we do not audit
4412537 in the short term the slowdown in the economy will affect us all
4412538 as confidence has waned businesses have scaled back aspects of their transaction activity but in challenging times businesses will be increasingly calling on their accountants for help
4412539 the profession must develop a stronger proposition to attract the right talent
4412540 there is no doubt the sector has come of age and that is largely due to the size of the bigger firms
4412541 if there is to be more consolidation it will take place in the mid tier and below not least as it is more common for individual partners to move than before
4412542 weve earned a reputation with our clients built on honesty innovation and craftsmanship
4412543 across greater manchester weve worked on major university healthcare and retail projects including the refurbish ment of christie hospital all of which makes us immensely proud
4412544 the new construction wing will focus on new build projects
4412545 i firmly believe that the new division will enable the company to achieve sales of 30m within three years as we will be able to take on those smaller contracts which many of the bigger companies dont want
4412546 holding the bank rate is better than raising rates as one mpc member suggested last month but a reduction would have been a welcome recognition of the current financial strains on households already struggling with hikes in other living costs

4412564 getting rid of stamp duty is no silver bullet it will not solve the ills of the housing market
4412565 im looking at a number of measures and im not going to be drawn
4412566 we have not concluded what exactly we need to do
4412567 if the government is going to come up with something then we need to know about it now
4412568 it is a combination of fewer housing transactions because buying a house is a key time when people change supplier and more people buying mobile broadband instead of fixed line access
4412569 daughter your faith has healed you go in peace and be freed from your suffering
4412570 i dont need no stinkin benchmark because i only use index funds so my portfolio is the benchmark
4412571 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4412572 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
4412573 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
4412574 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4412575 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration
4412576 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4412577 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4412578 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4412579 absolute return portfolio produced an annualized 13 1 percent exceeding the passive benchmark of the
4412580 absolute return portfolio produced an annualized 13 1 percent exceeding the passive benchmark of the
4412581 as sort of a clearing house for proper portfolios benchmarking
4412582 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4412583 that problem is pretty easily solved by calculating a portfolios time weighted return rather than irr or dollar weighted return and comparing the twr to the benchmark return twr removes the impact of cash flows on portfolio performance
4412584 you bring up a major issue with performance measurement cash flows in a portfolio are handled differently than cash flows in an index so there will always be some irr tracking error in between the portfolio and the index in an index it is assumed that the dividend is paid on the ex dividend date and reinvested in the index however in a portfolio the divided does not come in until the dividend payment date and then it might take another day or so to reinvest so by default using irr the portfolio cannot match the irr of the index
4412585 for example if you start with 10 000 and then add 1 00 000 during a year there is a twr return calculation from the 10 000 contribution to the date the 1 000 000 was added then there is second calculation starting the day of the 1 000 000 contribution
4412586 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4412587 it is a huge sum to anyone in the north east except for a few footballers
4412588 as our data shows in these current market conditions more people are struggling to meet their mortgage payments and it is vital that firms treat them fairly
4412589 it would be a very dangerous move to have a situation where the government saw its major role as guaranteeing lending
4412590 there is no reason why in the long run you need any guarantee of lending to the mortgages are increasingly hard to secure as lenders themselves are having difficulty sourcing credit

4412601 ero emozionato in avvio ma poi andato tutto bene questa prima volta mi ha dato sensazioni positive anche se era normale avere un po di timore
4412602 fans for the past two weeks you have been reading about a bad break i got yet today i consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth
4412603 it is not about the love of the game but the
4412604 hard work and togetherness they go hand in hand you need the hard work because its such a tough atmosphere to win week in and week out you need togetherness because you dont always win and you gotta hang though together

4412613 natasha im glad youre here today because youre going to phase three
4412614 you proud of yourself you were pretty damn mean when you first got here girl
4412615 a person who relapses on drugs needs further treatment our responses are research driven
4412616 we have 157 000 people in the prisons of texas thats a lot
4412617 we have a long standing history with the norwegian kings guard and it is something we are extremely proud of
4412618 its an honour that they take the time to visit us and we are all looking forward to welcoming them on friday
4412619 edinburgh zoo is famous for its king penguins and nils olav is definitely the most famous of them all
4412620 nils always recognises the norwegian guardsmen when they come to visit him
4412621 he loves the attention he receives at the ceremony and takes his time inspecting the troops
4412622 were all very excited about his new promotion and weve all been wondering what it could be
4412623 mariel and i both fenced a lot better in this match
4412624 its really obvious though because in the semifinal sada fenced amazingly well but you can see the huge jump when just one more fencer is fencing well i wish we would have had that in the semifinals but im still really happy that we are walking away with the medal
4412625 i wish id had that energy earlier but it cant always happen
4412626 its hard to put yourself in the zone on purpose and thats that i think i was trying to do i didnt let things flow as much as i should have but we competed in two events and came home with two medals each so i think that thats also good for us
4412627 if one of us is down or not focused we tend to know what to say to one another just because weve been on a team for so long
4412628 i think today in this match we just tried to stay positive and stay focused its hard coming down off of a loss to pick yourself up again but we were able to do it
4412629 thanks to safer vehicles aggressive law enforcement and our efforts countless families were spared the devastating news that a loved one was not coming home
4412630 i want to transform this jail into an ashram within six months
4412631 valutare con fredda logica e obiettivit il modo in cui loccidente sta rispondendo alla minaccia islamista e come potremmo e dovremmo rispondere
4412632 in gran parte delloccidente e sopratutto in europa si nega ciecamente che lislam radicale stia trasformando il mondo
4412633 la maggior parte delle elite europee e troppi politici e giornalisti americani credono di trovarsi alle solite sfide economiche e politiche sono come pecore che non riescono ad avvertire la presenza dei branchi di lupi nel bosco
4412634 vi una concreta minaccia di un attentato terroristico biologico di al qaida ma il mondo non ancora preparato il numero degli attacchi terroristici avvenuti in tutto il mondo e le prove raccolte che rivelano i piani di al qaida nel campo delle armi biologiche e chimiche confermano a sufficienza la mia preoccupazione a riguardo
4412635 gli americani e le elite in particolare rifiutano di comprendere che il loro paese impegnato in una guerra mortale contro un nemico che ci ha avvertito in ogni sua mossa e intenzione qualsiasi cosa accada a noi ai nostri figli e al nostro paese eravamo stati avvisati e abbiamo scelto di non lottare con tutte le nostre forze
4412636 nel settembre 2001 lintera nazione pass dallindifferenza o ignoranza della minaccia terroristica islamistica a una paura divorante proprio come sessantanni prima il 7 dicembre 1941 gli americani avevano abbandonato lisolazionismo compiaciuto per unirsi al mondo in guerra
4412637 each of these conferences weve done has brought a tremendous outpouring of elder americans who are trying to get as much meaning as possible from their golden years
4412638 good information was presented and the speaker is one good lady
4412639 government has a vital and important role to play but not the only role
4412640 there are many private and personal initiatives that equal the pursuit of happiness far more than just government delivery of its programs
4412641 all you have to do is look at his voting record
4412642 he has voted the wrong way on many issues critical to seniors if the people inside who hear him give his speech knew how he voted i think they would be disappointed
4412643 from day one to today i have operated in a bipartisan and constructive way to find solutions to todays problems
4412644 if oregonians want that im willing to do it another six years if they want a hyper partisan senator they can elect jeff merkley if they feel its wise to be under the total dictatorship of one party they will elect jeff merkley
4412645 for the first time in my life i was amazed by the mastery with which putin is able to hold onto power
4412646 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located we wont allow the deaths of our compatriots go unpunished
4412647 in any case i think this too is an indirect indication of who is more important in this ruling tandem
4412648 you see thugs differ from normal people in that when they smell blood its hard for them to stop
4412649 we will likely be defending the commissions decision in court
4412650 this was a backdoor attempt by out of state interests to overturn a law passed fair and square
4412651 the states interest in preventing fraud in the petition process
4412652 when they come forward and say hey these were our signatures this is me why did you reject it thats a just a matter of fairness
4412653 it doesnt matter what the issue is whether its land use or medical marijuana the process needs to be fixed
4412654 i feel like the parole board has had enough time and enough information to make a decision and this investigation kind of seals the deal
4412655 i really feel that they need to make a decision now they should have already made a decision i feel like its just more smoke and mirrors
4412656 mr gillmore has been fully cooperating with the investigation and we do not believe that mr gillmore has engaged in any activity that is either criminal or in any manner inappropriate
4412657 so im not going to be able to speak to what the specifics of the investigation are about
4412658 the last i heard from the oregon state police they left me a message thursday afternoon saying they had concluded their investigation because they had written the report and submitted it to the marion county district attorneys office im not going to comment about what i think the report may be about until i see official documents id simply be guessing
4412659 he certainly has been threatened by other inmates but i do not know if that was the reason for his move
4412660 we have always wanted a thorough deliberation by the board hopefully this investigation will be resolved quickly and the board can resume deliberations
4412661 if this person is now under state police investigation for misconduct or whatever what in the world are we doing in still considering whether to let this person out
4412662 hes dangerous the doctors all say that so sorry mr gillmore but you need to come back in two years
4412663 the women and little girls of our community shouldnt be the testing ground for richard gillmore
4412664 theres no way to know or even speculate whether arson is involved
4412665 they say its going to be the hottest so far this year
4412666 if folks dont have air conditioning and theyre getting hot they should go to the mall or go to the movies somewhere they can cool down
4412667 nobody says you have to buy that product from them
4412668 hes an excellent pro hes been working totally independently to anything that might be happening outside the football and any speculation has been dealt by his agent hes just been getting on with things professionally in training
4412669 we can today confirm that we have advised the metropolitan police service that the actor christian bale should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4412670 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4412671 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale
4412672 big brother is massive for these titles and it just hasnt been a water cooler conversation topic this time round
4412673 that will have had a significant impact on sales consumers may have also realised that these magazines are very similar in content it could be that the same number of consumers are now buying less titles the sector has simply peaked
4412674 the magazine market is very unstable and it would come as no surprise if tough economic conditions were to blame
4412675 there is a real generational change going on at the moment and many young consumers are using websites for their gossip
4412676 these sites are updated several times a day and are free consumers may not see any point in buying a copy of heat or hello at the end of the week
4412677 although circulation is falling it has to be remembered that in most cases they are falling from a very high starting point as they have had a lot of early success
4412678 i think the celebrity magazine market is suffering from a credibility problem readers are beginning to realise that so much of what is in them is fiction which lessens the excitement of buying them celebrity culture is not on the wane though you only have to look at the number of people who queue up at auditions of reality tv shows in the hope of becoming celebrities themselves
4412679 i hope that i will find out exactly how long it will take me to come back to training with my team mates i want to find out as well when they think i can play again my hope is that it is before christmas
4412680 knowing major european teams such as juventus are interested in me is a great honor
4412681 we have a long standing history with the norwegian kings guard and it is something we are extremely proud of
4412682 its an honour that they take the time to visit us and we are all looking forward to welcoming them on friday
4412683 edinburgh zoo is famous for its king penguins and nils olav is definitely the most famous of them all
4412684 nils always recognises the norwegian guardsmen when they come to visit him
4412685 he loves the attention he receives at the ceremony and takes his time inspecting the troops
4412686 were all very excited about his new promotion and weve all been wondering what it could be
4412687 im very excited to be here and it is a dream to play for such a big club in the premier league
4412688 i have known about newcastles interest for a while and i wanted to sign because it is a club i know all about from my time watching english football in spain and argentina
4412689 i think i am a good technical player and i will be suited to the speed and physical side of the game in england
4412690 i am also still fit because i was doing pre season training with deportivo and i cant wait to get started
4412691 sean franklin elbows jess marsch the refereee stands three yards away he doesnt do anything thats very disappointing instead of playing 15 minutes with them a man down we play the last 15 minutes with a man down
4412692 i just came up with my arm hopefully theres no hard feelings
4412693 wir haben im ersten halbjahr 2008 mehrere neue kunden akquiriert darunter mit panda security auch einen internationalen gro kunden der innerhalb europas eines der wachstumsst rksten softwareunternehmen ist und ein entsprechend hohes umsatzpotential im online handel bietet
4412694 die solide steigerung unseres umsatzes die wir trotz dollarschw che und gebremster konjunktur erzielt haben stimmt uns f r das zweite halbjahr zuversichtlich in dem wir weitere abschl sse mit internationalen kunden erwarten
4412695 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4412696 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4412697 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4412698 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4412699 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4412700 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4412701 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4412702 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4412703 we do remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement thats both fair and equitable providing that union leadership is reasonable and realistic in its approach
4412704 every day millions of idiots wake up if you can just make 0 99 from 3 168 of them in a month you can become rich
4412705 the real money in the app store may well lie in monetizing these free applications be it through integrated advertising or downloadable content though it remains to be seen what restrictions apple will place on this kind of strategy

4412711 any mans death diminishes me because i am involved in mankind
4412712 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4412713 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4412714 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4412715 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4412716 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4412717 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4412718 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4412719 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4412720 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4412721 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4412722 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4412723 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4412724 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4412725 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4412726 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4412727 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4412728 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4412729 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4412730 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4412731 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4412732 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4412733 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4412734 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4412735 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4412736 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4412737 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4412738 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4412739 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4412740 im back in training and feel 100 per cent so ill be ready for the start of the season at sunderland
4412741 it was really important for me to be involved in the pre season training camp in switzerland and i worked hard unfortunately another small problem kept me out when i got a kick on my shin which caused some inflammation but im now looking forward to the start of the season
4412742 it will be the managers decision whether i will be involved against sunderland i hope to do a good job and help the team make a good start to the season
4412743 now is the time when the results have to come and we are ready for the start of the season
4412744 we know that sunderland has improved their squad a lot during the summer and they are a strong team now
4412745 we have also improved by bringing in some quality players so we know that even the team isnt 100 per cent yet we hope to start well and get the three points we have a strong squad and we want to fight for the title this year
4412746 its really good to have competition and i think the boss is really pleased about that
4412747 he has a very good opportunity to change the system and use different players so everyone will be fighting for their place i think that is very good for the team
4412748 in every position we have two or three players so i think its very important during every training session that we all keep working hard and keep up our level
4412749 claro deixe me lembrar voc meu melhor amigo ele meu marido isto um pouco estranho
4412750 n o tinha pensado em como funcionaria minha qu mica com ele desde
4412751 joguei esta esp cie de jogo do gato e rato para ter meu marido e meu melhor amigo juntos
4412752 mas dif cil tanto se voc est casado com algu m quanto se n o est
4412753 asjaolu et see allkirjastati venemaa ja usa suhete v ga raske kriisi ajal gruusia situatsiooni le n itab seda et loomulikult ei ole raketit rjes steem suunatud iraani vastu vaid venemaa strateegilise potentsiaali vastu
4412754 teeme gruusiaga selles osas koost d praegu ootame neilt vastust et mida nad k ige rohkem vajavad
4412755 praegusel hinnangul on gruusias juba 100 000 p genikku ning nende abistamisega tuleb kohe tegeleda
4412756 que lamour soit son epice votre plat ravira tous les palais
4412757 i wouldnt be particularly sure until the transfer deadline passes what might materialise so well see
4412758 but hes our player and he wanted to play in the game and we think hes mentally tuned into it so thats all that matters
4412759 i think we have to look on it as the kick we needed
4412760 we are still in the game and we will have a good chance at anfield we all know we have to perform better and we will
4412761 the only good thing about that game for us was the 0 0 scoreline we were all very disappointed by the performance we gave as players and as a team we tried to do our best and it was not good enough
4412762 they could certainly have had one or two goals and reina was definitely man of the match he made some wonderful saves and also stopped a penalty
4412763 if you dont play well but still draw your worst games then you can actually look on that as a good thing we didnt concede a goal so you also have to take the positives and that is one
4412764 we are looking forward to saturday even more to show who we are and what we can do
4412765 it sometimes happens you dont play your best game as a team but we will not play like that at the stadium of light
4412766 the start of the season is big for us we know how important it will be against sunderland we have to do better and we know we will
4412767 maybe they didnt know the names of any single player in our team
4412768 maybe they made stupid decisions because they lost the ball and thought it would be so easy to get it back
4412769 we certainly werent there this evening we did not play at a level we expect to i believe we have good players here but unfortunately we did not get the performance we needed from the vast majority of them
4412770 we have to trust ourselves and believe we can do it
4412771 the squad has improved season after season and we have to believe this can be our year
4412772 i hope that in ten months we can be celebrating i would like to win the premier league firstly for our supporters but also because its the most difficult competition in the world
4412773 we just want to be involved in every competition this season that has to be our aim we want to get closer to the top two and also have a good run in the champions league again
4412774 the new players who have come in will help us i think robbie keane will be a great partner for fernando he has had some brilliant years at tottenham hes a world class player and he will score a lot of goals for liverpool
4412775 the first league game is always difficult and it will be for us at sunderland
4412776 we won there last season but i remember it wasnt easy they are a difficult side to play against and they will be going for it against us we have to be strong defensively and then wait for our moment
4412777 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia
4412778 crosses a red line for the united states of america
4412779 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4412780 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4412781 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4412782 the bottom line to it is john edwards and elizabeth edwards had no knowledge of anything i did
4412783 nat rlich habe ich respekt vor ihm aber man darf auch nicht zu viel respekt haben auch er spielt nur fu ball
4412784 he was in the right frame of mind and wanted to play nothing would have stopped him so that is pleasing
4412785 i have no idea what will happen between now and the end of august
4412786 he knew the consequences of playing tonight so the decision was very much his
4412787 i could not think at all about the game on sunday until we had played tonight but i was very pleased with some of the football we played
4412788 we obviously need to tighten up our defence if we could but i was very pleased to win
4412789 since it is obvious we dont have any chance in the second leg we will concentrate on the league
4412790 i dont think this game will break us down i doubt well play against a team as good as this again this summer
4412791 the game was over before it began we let in two goals in six minutes when there was a total lack of concentration
4412792 i do not know if players showed aston villa too much respect which was not necessary
4412793 if you go two goals behind against such a team at home obviously it will be difficult but we tried and showed sometimes that we are a good attacking team
4412794 but in football you must also play defence and that we did not
4412795 of course i am disappointed we planned to get more out of this game and were hoping to get a good result by that i mean a draw or losing by one goal which meant we would be going out there to possibly put pressure on them
4412796 as far as being able to go out and do the things he wants to do hes been able to do that
4412797 thats so much better than a number on a scale
4412798 last i heard he can still ride a bike as opposed to being a week or 10 days from dying
4412799 i notice that stress eating is something i do well
4412800 i am a true apple fan so this is nothing to make apple look bad i think apple should come out and tell people whats going on with these phones
4412801 my calls get dropped a lot and im not even moving one inch anywhere
4412802 i move my chair a little bit and my call gets dropped its just weird
4412803 she comes up with new stuff every album she works with new people
4412804 shes aggressive with pursuing young people thats how you stay current you dont wear the same clothes you keep people guessing and mystified what new idea has cher come up with michael jackson started out at the same time and theyre like apples and oranges overall madonna has always succeeded by staying ahead of curve
4412805 she would say a girl likes to change her hair color or hairstyle
4412806 it is possible that some unknown environmental factor is the cause of current health problems and of gulf war syndrome
4412807 but it is also possible that these symptoms result from the stress of military deployment especially prolonged and multiple deployments
4412808 women now comprise approximately 15 percent of our nations armed forces and since the persian gulf war combat roles for women have expanded substantially
4412809 this study is an attempt to understand the impact of deployment and war related stressors on the health of military women
4412810 we can go in a sense from an ultra fine point sharpie to one with a fat tip
4412811 the tip of each polymer pen starts with nanometer scale sharpness but if we press down harder the tip flattens out this gives us great flexibility in the structures we can produce
4412812 im very proud of being tall and what i try to do if i can help even one person in my lifetime with their attitude toward life then its all worth it
4412813 in adulthood its a very insidious disease and it takes nearly 10 years to pick up

4412815 discovery its a hoax its a halloween costume in a box
4412816 theres a whole number of things that raise red flags in my opinion
4412817 we started to tell people the week after we found the body but no on believed us
4412818 so we started to make fun of the bigfoot trackers and that got attention
4412819 you type in bigfoot and thats the name that comes up
4412820 the city of corvallis is really safe but were also in the real world
4412821 i got very nervous we had exhausted every possibility we had searched all the apartments that she could possibly be working in we looked everywhere then we called the police
4412822 normally we would wait because adults can come and go as they please and we would normally wait to see if she showed up maybe the next day
4412823 it was amazing to us that they acted that fast and i think one of the reasons was when they immediately did a quick check they saw brooke was a great kid
4412824 wir sollten in zukunft all jenen staaten eine umfassende kooperation anbieten die bereit sind mit uns sinnvolle l sungen f r die gewachsenen kundenbeziehungen zu finden und an einer faireren und konstruktiven zusammenarbeit f r die zukunft interessiert sind
4412825 a place that may ultimately reveal just exactly what kind of environment habitable or not we have within this tortured little moon
4412826 knowing exactly where to point at just the right time was critical to this event
4412827 enceladus was streaking across the sky so quickly that the spacecraft had no hope of tracking any feature on its surface
4412828 our best option was to point the spacecraft far ahead of enceladus spin the spacecraft and camera as fast as possible in the direction of enceladus predicted path and let enceladus overtake us at a time when we could match its motion across the sky snapping images along the way
4412829 we connected the dots to draw a critical conclusion and found evidence over the amazon that traces the direct path of the effect of human activity on climate change by way of human caused aerosols
4412830 during the dry season in the amazon the only aerosols of any magnitude are from smoke emerging from human initiated fires
4412831 we saw an example of this ourselves increased aerosols over the amazon produced less cloud cover over the atlantic ocean however increased aerosols actually produced more cloud cover
4412832 we wanted to know what the link was between these different outcomes from varying amounts and types of aerosols this paper gives us a clear picture of what is occurring
4412833 this result helps us understand aerosols effect on a clouds mass and lifetime how long it will provide cloud cover how deep the clouds will be and when and where it will rain
4412834 progress and prospects on water for a clean and healthy world with special focus on sanitation
4412835 the first flight was a success and made the first in situ measurements of gases in a volcanic plume using meteorological balloons
4412836 the balloons are piloted remotely by satellite link with flight visualization using google earth we were looking at tropospheric volcanic emissions of sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide and water which can be hazardous to human and animal health and degrade ecosystems
4412837 the stratification could represent separation of the gases through meteorological processes such as water droplet formation
4412838 lessons learned from the past research in extreme environments training conditioning and countermeasures for psychological stress are some of the things nasa is in the process of addressing for the upcoming age of exploration
4412839 behavioral health problems can interfere with the success of the mission especially on long duration space flights like missions to the international space station the moon and mars

4412870 its a huge challenge for archivists to deal with digital information
4412871 one of the most interesting problems for digital preservation is interactivity and how difficult that is to preserve
4412872 video games offer all of the same problems as digital art
4412873 they are interactive very complex and a lot of people get involved in making them happen
4412874 you cannot just throw everything into a box and put it in the attic so in 50 years your kids can look at it
4412875 when you are trying to preserve anything you are trying to preserve the most important things about that artefact
4412876 with video games we do not yet know what is important
4412877 we want to raise the consciousness in the industry about how important these records are
4412878 i do not think they save anything or its saved in such a way that they would not be able to recognise the significance of what they are holding
4412879 a lot of people have mentioned that to me as a pivotal moment in their lives
4412880 i would like to talk to people who experienced that saw it happen or where they were when they heard about it
4412881 maybe we can talk to the people who did it and whether they knew lord british was richard garriott
4412882 you cannot just throw everything into a box and put it in the attic so in 50 years your kids can look at it
4412883 thats not going to happen because digital media degrades so fast
4412884 the raw formats that cameras capture images in are proprietary in nature so this raises issues around accessibility if the information about that raw format is lost
4412885 those are two areas that we need to address to do our jobs successfully not just for today but for the next generation
4412886 as more and more information is published in e only formats the legislation must keep pace so that we as digital librarians can keep this information safe without the threat of legal issues hanging over us

4412920 the question is whether he crossed the line in saying find out where his kids go to school

4412969 se ha venido trabajando sobre estos temas por medio de charlas o de talleres es decir que en esto hay que sincerarse no es una novedad hablar de sexualidad en las aulas
4412970 hablar de educaci n sexual implica tratar temas relacionados con la salud f sica y mental con conocer el funcionamiento del cuerpo y de la afectividad y relacionarlos con el desarrollo de los conceptos que brinda la biolog a y las ciencias relacionadas con el ser humano
4412971 todos los temas que tengan que ver con la sexualidad de nuestros alumnos tienen que ser abordados desde un enfoque cient fico atendiendo a la diversidad cultural
4412972 i think the audience would be insulted if you did because then you feel this obvious pressure to appeal
4412973 the beauty of the evil dead movies is that youre only appealing to one demographic and thats people who like horror movies and you just have to please them you dont have to appeal to the studio youre already pleasing them by giving them part 4

4412988 i had the choice of rangers and celtic and it was a hard decision to make
4412989 but the chance to play in the champions league was what swung it for me
4412990 i was flattered by rangers interest but the chance to play in europe was just too good to turn down
4412991 im delighted to be joining a club like celtic they are a big club and it will be a dream to play for them
4412992 jeromes a young player that harry has always liked a quick wide player who is a good addition to the squad
4412993 the idea is that he comes here and proves himself if he plays to the ability we all know he has then he has a great chance of staying here longer so its in his hands
4412994 i saw this goalkeeper against rangers twice and i think he is a talented goalkeeper and i am delighted to have signed him
4412995 we are searching for a goalkeeper and he was one of our candidates i think this goalkeeper has the quality to grow into the team
4412996 we now have the goalkeeper david obua and mike tullberg and our focus must be on always bringing in quality all three players have quality
4412997 if it made her feel bad to tell us about how emiline had died and everything she shouldnt have to do it someone else should have done it for her mr dixon in assembly should have said instead of making us sing give me oil in my lamp although i had to admit it was a good song not exactly up there with burning love but good nonetheless it wasnt fair and i wanted to make it better for her but didnt know how

4413015 if you take the average wage of 450 pounds a week or 23 400 pounds a year we calculate a firm would need 340 staff to incur a wage bill to match what lampard is being paid
4413016 even a firm paying a range of salaries from average to higher would probably employ around 150 people to have a wage bill like that

4413055 it implied somewhat better trade prospects towards the year end
4413056 we are hoping to bring in a couple of players in time for saturday we know we have to add more quality to the squad and we are working very very hard to do that
4413057 the british market is incredibly difficult to work in because the fees for players and their wages are excessive what we do need to do as a club is increase our scouting network abroad
4413058 a lot of players enjoy being around bigger clubs even if they arent in the team
4413059 they enjoy the kudos and everything else that goes with it and dont fancy a battle at a club like stoke
4413060 that is one of the reasons we have to be very careful to attract the right players and right characters
4413061 i just wanted to step on it in the first 50m a little bit and try and get out to an early lead
4413062 i knew that was a hard double for ryan i knew in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
4413063 you could say a game here is worth two elsewhere but it is more than that
4413064 i want to challenge myself both in matches and in training every day and i want to improve my game that is why i am here as long as the manager keeps me as part of the team that will do for me
4413065 it is over three weeks since we learned that the portuguese authorities had closed the investigation to find madeleine lifted our arguido status and ended judicial secrecy
4413066 we were surprised that copies of investigation files were given to the media the content of these files has been extensively reported it will be clear to everyone now that there is absolutely no evidence that suggests madeleine has been seriously harmed
4413067 knowing this we strongly believe that madeleine is out there and can be found of course whoever is responsible for madeleines abduction must and can be found to prevent them from putting another child and family through the misery we have suffered
4413068 he was in the right frame of mind and wanted to play nothing would have stopped him so that is pleasing i have no idea what will happen between now and the end of august he knew the consequences of playing tonight so the decision was very much his
4413069 i could not think at all about the game on sunday until we had played here but i was very pleased with some of the football we played
4413070 for me its chelsea this year i always felt that united would do it last year but i fancy chelsea this time
4413071 theres no african cup of nations in january theyve got a new manager theyve bought one or two players and for all the ups and downs last year they still nearly nicked it
4413072 some other protesters have been roughed up people have been threatened assaulted punched and kicked clearly we are striking a nerve but our protest is not with the chinese police in beijing but the hardline leadership which has refused to listen to reasoned arguments about tibet
4413073 dergelijke groei van de markt is ongebruikelijk in het tweede kwartaal van het jaar het is duidelijk dat in het tweede kwartaal van 2008 dat intel de groei veroorzaakte

4413075 they both gave a lot against twente the game on saturday morning comes very quickly but in fairness i am not in a position where i can make many changes at the moment
4413076 the great task in front of us over the next two years is to lift the experience of the linux desktop from something that is stable and robust and not so pretty into something that is art
4413077 can we not only emulate but can we blow right past apple
4413078 should a client have one investment profile per account project or per person
4413079 the third quarter will be a net loss and the full year will turn to a net loss
4413080 as much as 25 of the team has been affected by the apparent run of tinea cruris kicker david buehler estimated the condition seems to have spread by way of new compression shorts or tights worn under their football pants
4413081 i dont know what it is but im staying away from it
4413082 for whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup you proclaim the lords death until he comes
4413083 rooted and built up in him strengthened in the faith
4413084 im very excited to be here and it is a dream to play for such a big club in the premier league
4413085 i have known about newcastles interest for a while and i wanted to sign because it is a club i know all about from my time watching english football in spain and argentina
4413086 i think i am a good technical player and i will be suited to the speed and physical side of the game in england
4413087 i am also still fit because i was doing pre season training with deportivo and i cant wait to get started
4413088 but the results of their national team in the big competitions dont seem to have been helped by the blessings of high pay tv income at all
4413089 the commission abuses the league and endangers professional football in germany with their intervention
4413090 its a populist decision paradoxically designed to decrease competition rather than to increase it
4413091 if we had two more players it would be difficult to keep everyone happy
4413092 i think thats true if we had not had any urgency to get on with it we would not be in the muddle we are in now because we would have done it in the usual way by getting a referral dr wakefield was a man in a hurry and in full time research
4413093 im not suggesting that the complications were serious but you would accept that having a child admitted to hospital overnight with a fever and feeling unwell is worrying for parents

4413114 tanggal 15 juli 2003 lalu kepolisian sudah mengirimkan surat permintaan batuan penangkapan ke kita surat itu berlaku sampai 2 mei 2004 namun kita baru berhasil menemukan persembunyian dan menangkap robert kemarin di banda aceh
4413115 inikan bukan kasus kita ini hanya permintaan bantuan dari kepolisian australia jadi kita tidak tahu nilai penipuan yang dilakukannya
4413116 newspaper should treat serious but also more easygoing news and sap beacuse we fell in general bitter with corriere it

4413118 harapan kita bpk bisa membuka panjang lebar terkait temuan temuan yang telah dilakukan sehingga dari situ sambil menunggu hasil audit investigasi yang dilakukan bpk maka panitia angket akan melakukan penyelidikan
4413119 people living together should not assume that they will automatically have the same rights as married couples or civil partners
4413120 in court there is no such thing as a common law marriage
4413121 for about 15 to 20 minutes we were sure wed lost our son
4413122 ten years ago he was medivacked to a hospital in portland ore where we were told our son would probably never survive
4413123 here we are 10 years later in a hospital cardio vascular intensive care unit watching shawn as he gets a little stronger every day with a new heart
4413124 historically the 472nd stood up in a time of war when they were needed and within less than a year they were on the ground in europe
4413125 that could potentially be the case with what the 472nd does right now
4413126 today our army and corps are being tested as it rarely has been before in the global war on terror
4413127 nevertheless mr reed continues to fail to comply with the reporting deadlines
4413128 you know have i been late in my filings in the past yes
4413129 but i was shocked and surprised that all of a sudden matters like this are being handled this way it certainly is a different departure from the way apoc has handled these things for the past quarter of a century
4413130 weve started living in a topsy turvy world a lot of friends have called me today with varying speculation but i cant answer that question
4413131 i dont think any government would lower itself to that level
4413132 it was presented as a problem as a drain on the staffs resources
4413133 so the public was never denied any information it was always there always available
4413134 an apparent pattern of deception and willful attempt to mislead the public
4413135 apoc records will show that and our bank account backs it up
4413136 the timing and one sided nature of the palin administrations propaganda are an illegal attempt to influence voters
4413137 been doing any campaigning or putting inserts in papers or making speeches about the issues
4413138 it is pretty unprecedented the state would campaign against its own citizens to influence an election
4413139 there was so much interest to start with they believe if they track down those students theyll get what they need
4413140 i dont believe theres a hard fast date at this point
4413141 but now that people have established their lives and future generations here its not an option
4413142 nu putem compara nivelul clujului cu nivelul bucurestiului de acum 4 ani abia in 2003 2004 in bucuresti se atingea varful de vanzari de vile periaoda in care in cluj oamenii abia incepeau sa se gandeasca la investitii imobiliare si le a trebuit minim 2 ani sa inteleaga potentialul acestui oras
4413143 apoi in orice oras din provincie se construieste mult mai mult in regie proprie nu cred ca acestea sunt niste vanzari mici
4413144 din cele 60 de vile au ramas disponibile 15 din care o parte sunt finisate iar celelalte fiind in stadiul de constructie la rosu

4413163 ich hoffe dass diese wirtschaftlich gescheiterten au enseiter und neider nun endlich verstanden haben dass ihre verleumderischen unterstellungen zwar viel staub aufgewirbelt aber zu keinem zeitpunkt der wahrheit entsprochen haben

4413181 beken meisje dat je zeven jaar geleden met mij een ritje wilde maken in de hoop dat je ook zo een lelijke eend zou krijgen
4413182 ik was zo gekwetst en ik heb aan het stuur getrokken en we zwalkten over de weg en toen vloog je tegen het portier aan
4413183 het portier was slecht gesloten ik greep de zetel maar kreeg geen vat ik sloeg met het hoofd tegen het beton en was op slag dood je hebt naar me gekeken je hebt alle portieren opengezet het zonnedak open gedraaid en de alarmlichtjes aangezet

4413186 we played well in the congo due to good defensive organisation which never gave our opponents a chance to threaten us mazembe would not have scored had the match lasted two days
4413187 as china develops a socialist market economy the promotion and popularization of putonghua in the country is becoming more and more important
4413188 a lot of these goods are made on consignment for multinationals if there were punitive tariffs american businesses would have to pay
4413189 this cannot last will crash it cannot keep this up
4413190 rather than building a us style power bristling with arms and intolerant of others world views
4413191 chinas emerging power is based on the example of their own model the strength of their economic system and their rigid defense of national sovereignty
4413192 true success in strategic issues involves manipulating a situation so effectively that the outcome is inevitably in favor of chinese interests this emerges from the oldest chinese strategic thinker sun zi who argued that every battle is won or lost before it is ever fought

4413204 i want to congratulate my players while a big thank you needs to go out to our fans who helped us so much
4413205 we gave absolutely everything in this game and we thoroughly deserved to beat a very big opponent my only regret was that we failed to score a second goal towards the end but this is just the first half and there is another tough encounter to come
4413206 we must once again give everything so as not to lose this chance
4413207 we have literally pulled the rug from under the feet of greek football after anorthosis 3 0 victory over olympiacos on wednesday it was omonias turn to claim a proud and historic victory over aek in athens
4413208 normally its not an advantage to take over from a successful coach but preudhomme has left behind a well skilled side that i can build on further
4413209 mentally we can flick the switch and focus on the league
4413210 theyll benefit from playing fewer matches which will automatically decrease the other competitors chances
4413211 wir sagen nicht zu allem ja und amen und werden klarmachen was wir nicht mittragen
4413212 in dem sinne dass wir sagen was wir tun und tun was wir sagen
4413213 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
4413214 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
4413215 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
4413216 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca
4413217 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
4413218 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
4413219 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
4413220 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
4413221 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
4413222 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
4413223 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
4413224 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
4413225 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4413226 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
4413227 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
4413228 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
4413229 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4413230 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
4413231 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
4413232 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
4413233 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
4413234 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
4413235 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
4413236 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
4413237 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
4413238 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
4413239 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
4413240 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
4413241 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
4413242 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
4413243 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
4413244 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
4413245 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
4413246 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family
4413247 evidemment je ne suis pas daccord car cette mesure est une mesure qui une fois de plus ne r gle rien long terme
4413248 on va essayer de ne pas r percuter cette mesure dans nos tarifs cette ann e
4413249 je ne veux pas prendre dengagement pour les ann es qui viennent
4413250 the level crossing is crossed by hundreds of thousands of motorists every day and theres not one single collision involving a train on impact sgt exton told the committal hearing for scholl
4413251 i saw the train and saw there was nowhere to go in front so i tried to swing to the left so i wouldnt hit the train he said
4413252 overall were saying lets hold the bar very high but lets aim for something thats realistic
4413253 theyve already proven that with medals at the world championships we can count on them to be in the hunt for medals
4413254 when rebecca won the worlds that took a little pressure off sarah and it gives a lot of extra motivation for her
4413255 hammers been extremely consistent in international competition in the past 10 international events shes medaled in nine she knows what she needs to do were confident she will be in the medal round she has a history of lifting her came come race day
4413256 our team sprint guys are improving our first objective is to try to get past qualifying but everyone knows who the big favorites are
4413257 the madison guys have both had success at the world cup level the good thing with them is that theyve been riding together for a long time theyve known each other since they were kids were keeping our fingers crossed
4413258 hes been riding well every day he seems to be setting a new pr
4413259 its obvious hes a fabulous talent what were trying to do is to get everyone to remember that hes here competing against professionals and that he only graduated from high school six weeks ago
4413260 we had a very good day wednesday with a gold and a bronze any time you have that kind of success on the team it helps everybody
4413261 it helps the staff it helps the athletes now we turn our focus to the track its the olympics anything can happen
4413262 the information we are all giving to online companies is massive and dangerous and securitys going to get worse before it gets better
4413263 our belief is that with the right technology the new generation of cloud computing system can be made as secure if not more secure than existing server based office systems

4413267 in light of the current environment we are extremely satisfied with the development of our business
4413268 we expect the expansion of the range of services we offer in packaging our starpool joint venture with dsl bank the agency sales of deutsche postbank and the acquisition of interhyp ag by the ing group to provide further growth momentum to the now more than ever central and independent marketplace for mortgage financing over the coming quarters
4413269 we are delighted that our development in a generally weak environment is a clear sign of the benefit of highly qualified jobs in germany our company attracts high performers and these are exactly the people we need to continue our successful progress

4413273 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs
4413274 our members have had enough the liberalisation of ground handling services across uk airports has resulted in a race to the bottom which must and will stop
4413275 we will not stand back and allow labour costs to determine whether contracts are won or lost
4413276 we expected to have a good month it certainly beat our expectations

4413285 we want every family to know about and participate in the school choice process

4413301 its a huge challenge for archivists to deal with digital information
4413302 one of the most interesting problems for digital preservation is interactivity and how difficult that is to preserve
4413303 video games offer all of the same problems as digital art
4413304 they are interactive very complex and a lot of people get involved in making them happen
4413305 you cannot just throw everything into a box and put it in the attic so in 50 years your kids can look at it
4413306 when you are trying to preserve anything you are trying to preserve the most important things about that artefact
4413307 with video games we do not yet know what is important
4413308 we want to raise the consciousness in the industry about how important these records are
4413309 i do not think they save anything or its saved in such a way that they would not be able to recognise the significance of what they are holding
4413310 a lot of people have mentioned that to me as a pivotal moment in their lives
4413311 i would like to talk to people who experienced that saw it happen or where they were when they heard about it
4413312 maybe we can talk to the people who did it and whether they knew lord british was richard garriott
4413313 you cannot just throw everything into a box and put it in the attic so in 50 years your kids can look at it
4413314 thats not going to happen because digital media degrades so fast
4413315 the raw formats that cameras capture images in are proprietary in nature so this raises issues around accessibility if the information about that raw format is lost
4413316 those are two areas that we need to address to do our jobs successfully not just for today but for the next generation
4413317 as more and more information is published in e only formats the legislation must keep pace so that we as digital librarians can keep this information safe without the threat of legal issues hanging over us

4413331 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4413332 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4413333 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4413334 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4413335 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4413336 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4413371 im assured the road has been cleared and the bridges repaired all the way through its the dry season siri we could be in luang prabang in a day or two
4413372 and the presidents wife might grow a penis on her chin
4413373 i hope were going in a tank unless its been rerouted that road passes directly through enemy controlled territory arent you afraid of getting shot
4413374 where have you been siri dont you read the khaosan newsletters there is no enemy hes been van quished all we have now are one or two hmong rebel gangs hiding in the jungle even so well be traveling with crack peoples liberation army commandos itll be safer than crossing lan xang avenue dont be afraid old fellow
4413375 the blood we shed for the republic has turned to sweat
4413376 ive seen wild birds in the branches of trees looking enviously at caged song doves we all of us want what we cant have do you wish you were there
4413377 i was there briefly i liked everything about it its so modern the stores have so much choice compared to ours theyre crammed with all kinds of goodies but i dont know i wondered where it would end you get a rice cooker and you lust for an oven you get an oven and you want a chef to come and cook for you once you get into that cycle you can never be satisfied
4413378 i appreciate things more and i dont have nothing i have friends i have a reasonably good life a socially responsible job experiences i mean how many people get to hang out with a legend of the underground movement
4413379 oh dear you cant believe everything siri tells you you know
4413380 yes i can hes told me all about you he says what he believes thats why i respect him i wish i had nerve enough to blurt out what i actually feel like he does
4413381 that luxury comes with age when youre younger you dont always get away with saying what you believe particularly in this type of system
4413382 did you think it would end up like this when you were fighting the french did you think the alternative to colonialism would be so so claustrophobic did you think wed be looking over our shoulders all the time wor rying we might be doing or saying something to offend the party
4413383 were in transition dtui things will get better at least we lao are in control of our own destiny now
4413384 well shake them off have faith the worst is behind us we havent known real peace for my entire lifetime lets sit back and enjoy it while weve got it by the way my glass is empty
4413385 i feel like we should be off catching the bomber
4413386 ive told you patience is a vital component of a suc cessful investigation rushing into it without a plan is a waste of human resources
4413387 the trip to the police station yesterday was a com plete waste of human resources what did the boy say and why should we share our findings with you two ladies talk about insolence
4413388 right but didnt that inspire us to think laterally and didnt that period of thought lead to our brilliant insight
4413389 and you said perhaps we could ask the staff whether they noticed anyone hanging around all afternoon on friday
4413390 right but it was you who remembered the nurses and the photographs it wouldnt have entered my head
4413391 yes it would and it probably wont help anyway when the prints come back from the shop tomorrow all well see is smiling nurses and flowers not a bomber in sight hes hardly likely to pose with them is he now
4413392 so little faith in one so young remember anythings possible
4413393 there must be more we can do if only we could get access to the army bomb squad report or the police investigations im sure we could do more than the boy wonders
4413394 until siri and phosy come back its just you and me i have all kinds of contacts in high places in the south but nobody up here not yet
4413395 have an influential friend you do too or at least an ex influential friend
4413396 he isnt going to be in any state to help us
4413397 i must say its rare that i get two voluptuous lady visi tors at the same time
4413398 nice to see i havent lost that magnetism how did you get here
4413399 all this way and you with your arthritis madame daeng
4413400 cant let a little chronic pain spoil a day out com rade
4413401 thats the spirit then i think you both deserve a drink for making it here
4413402 but madame daeng got quite sloshed at lunchtime i think thats why she cant feel her legs
4413403 womens union excursion again shes been sign ing up for all of them since i became redundant cant really understand it youd think shed want to spend all her time cleaning up after me wouldnt you
4413404 then wed better get cracking we cant have our chief and only coroner killed by some maniac can we now
4413405 undoubtedly if a respected party dinosaur cant call in a favor or two who the blazes can
4413406 youre right again oh by the way i redressed him for collection
4413407 certainly if there is a cut the banks must pass every single cent on to those who have got home loans and the small business community
4413408 the banks have recently had the benefit of a 20 to 30 basis point cut effectively in the price they are paying for money
4413409 they could be in a position to cuts rates right now before the reserve bank moves if it chooses to do so
4413410 it seems they are not taking seriously what mr swan says and i would expect that the treasurer in fact should be meeting the ceos of the major banks and make absolutely clear to them what the australian public expects
4413411 i think that our system is trying to treat everybody under a particular brand and it doesnt work
4413412 and because of that were creating housing problems were creating employment problems were creating community problems and its needless
4413413 i understand how everybody deserves a second chance and all but im not willing to risk my children and my neighbors to find out if theyre rehabilitated or not
4413414 its what i call a tough policy thats not smart
4413415 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4413416 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4413417 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4413418 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4413419 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4413420 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4413421 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4413422 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4413423 we do remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement thats both fair and equitable providing that union leadership is reasonable and realistic in its approach

4413433 customers are not prepared to forgo their main summer holiday
4413434 i dont believe they are prepared to forgo their second winter holiday either albeit they may wish to cut back on expenditure
4413435 customers are booking earlier and the remainder of the summer has 18 per cent fewer holidays remaining than last year
4413436 whilst looking at price rises for next year we are still significantly cheaper than holidaying in the uk
4413437 we are a holiday company we are not in the business of just selling flights
4413438 inflation in energy prices is passing through to other items and the disinflation we have previously seen from cheap imports is now clearly a thing of the past the fed is in a predicament it could raise rates to drive down demand but how much do you want to sacrifice for that new jobless claims are already definitely at recession levels
4413439 the boys have been able to switch on and off during the season so no matter what happens in the cup final well be ready for north down
4413440 theres a long way to go and although i am backing ourselves to win there is still plenty of time for a result out of the blue north down might have an off day against one of the other teams and et professional ewen thompson will be back on saturday
4413441 its all we have to play for now shieldsy captain peter shields is a pretty driven man and hell make sure that we dont go empty handed this year
4413442 we have stars all the way through the team and the team to beat us will have to play very well
4413443 north down are only in third or fourth gear and more often than not theyre a team that turns up on the big day so im fairly confident we will win one of the remaining fixtures against csn if not both
4413444 this is based on an old chinese childrens game in the song zhao guang talks of throwing a handkerchief off a building and resolving to follow whoever picks it up
4413445 he obviously was in his particular case he was very desperate his world had pretty well crumbled he was in a desperate situation
4413446 property crimes always historically have gone up during economic downturns when people have lost their jobs theres not a lot of work available
4413447 some people will go to that point because they target people that they know when theyre in the midst of some financial or personal hardship
4413448 maybe there are some feelings that its less likely to be caught feelings that theyre less likely to be turned in feelings that theyre more likely to get trust from the people theyre going after

4413455 now we are seeing a new wind beginning to blow and i believe it will be the next step in the evolution of the search for the perfect algorithm
4413456 im going to build my own authority site so i can rank well using the criteria set forth in the above definitions
4413457 authority sites are sites that have been linked to and referenced on other web sites covering the same subject matter and they also will have hundreds if not thousands of pages covering that subject matter and nearly every facet of it
4413458 we believe a page is an authority on the query topic if and only if some of the best experts on the query topic point to it of course in practice some expert pages may be experts on a broader or related topic if so only a subset of the hyperlinks on the expert page may be relevant
4413459 in such cases the links being considered have to be carefully chosen to ensure that their qualifying text matches the query by combining relevant out links from many experts on the query topic we can find the pages that are most highly regarded by the community of pages related to the query topic this is the basis of the high relevance that our algorithm delivers
4413460 clarify that statement ill just post it here so i can get some placements out of it were all over thinking the problem there is disdain for seo for the simple fact it does not exist we are not discussing clients hiring people to optimize search engines now are we that fact alone makes it impossible to define in a way we can all agree with yet it continues to be bought and sold there is such a thing as online business development there is such a thing as online traffic generation website optimization for improved functionality or increased conversions and there is such a thing as public relations and brand building go to people who specialize and advertise in these types of services and you can set verifiable targets and metrics that can be gauged you can set specific requirements and i can deliver specific results thereby establishing a market that governs itself much like any other real

4413483 im not one for taking holidays but i have taken this week off and i might be going to new jersey for my nieces 21st birthday in october
4413484 because we were driving we couldnt even have any of the champagne offered to us but we made up for it with celebrations over the weekend and since
4413485 good luck to you im delighted its a great amount of money to win
4413486 my understanding is that they want to develop it all in one go to ensure the viability of the site
4413487 he is running the show and i think that he is getting a bit too big for his boots that i might have to leave him out of the game against dundalk
4413488 no he was absolutely brilliant again tonight and he scored two great goals the composure that he showed for the first goal in particular was something that you would expect from a 30 year old and not a 20 year old
4413489 his second goal was a superb goal as well and he was unlucky not to get a hat trick he has been a find and he might be the difference to us winning the league
4413490 david is very enthusiastic and he is not the type of lad that will leave all this go to his head and he works very hard and looks after himself very well but i think that he will have work on his upper body and get stronger but that will come in time
4413491 we were sluggish tonight and it wasnt a great performance really i think that there was an element of tiredness after playing three games last week but in fairness to mike kerley that was a totally different limerick team that we played tonight than the one we played earlier in the season
4413492 i just thought that kevin waters left foot would be crucial tonight and thats the reason why he started left back
4413493 i think that limerick came down and made it a battle more than a football match and as a result considering that we werent 100 we were dragged down but having said we came through that and to win three one is something that i would have taken coming down in the car luke and karl had other chances but i think 5 1 would have been a total injustice on limerick
4413494 we keep our unbeaten run at home and i think that its has to stay that way we have six home games and we have to win them all but it is the away games against dundalk and shelbourne over the next few weeks that are the big tests the way were playing we look very solid and i dont see any reason why we cant go on from here and hopefully win the league
4413495 the leaving certificate results in particular can represent a crossroads in a persons life and it can be a particularly difficult time for students whether they have concerns over their grades decisions about their future or anxiety over starting college
4413496 while for some it is undoubtedly a time of celebration for others it can still be a time of stress and isolation which is why it is crucial that young people know that they have somewhere to turn to for support and information

4413498 we fully expected when we received our planning permission from waterford city council in july 2007 that we would face appeals to an bord plean la and would have anticipated at least some of the delay that these appeals have given rise to
4413499 encouragingly we continue to receive a lot of support from the wider community in waterford and interest remains strong among potential tenants in ireland and overseas even in the current economic climate
4413500 we now look forward to a positive decision from an bord plean la on the planning appeals and subsequently to delivering the scheme as soon as feasible

4413516 corruption in the police force has come under increasing scrutiny in recent times along with the increasing frequency of bribery are special challenges presented by the sophisticated methods applied
4413517 officers who are regularly on the same assignment expect bribes on a daily basis and prefer using the cellphones on the other hand their colleagues arent sure who they are dealing with and expect instant cash
4413518 this is very positive in terms of literary rates for the future we are often concerned about the impact of television and playstations and so on but this goes to show that given the opportunity children will still enjoy reading and both parents and teachers should be complemented for their efforts in encouraging this
4413519 we very pleased with the figures so far this year 100 000 books since the first of january is really impressive and indicates what a valuable resource the library continues to be
4413520 we are very active in the area of computers and inter net access last year alone we gave away 25 000 free hours of internet service this real ly makes a difference for young people particularly those from rural areas who may not have access at home they can come in do research for school go on bebo or whatever they want and it is in a safe supervised environment for them
4413521 we have also worked very hard in improving access to libraries not just in terms of catering for wheelchairs and people with disabilities but even in relation to accommodating double buggies and providing adequate capacity within libraries to give people space and comfort while they are there
4413522 we already know that people want more from their libraries tramore library for instance currently has five adult reading groups which combine reading with an opportunity to socialise and meet people we are also developing a new section to the library which will be devoted to catering for young people with the co operation of foroige and the youth caf in tramore we have already consulted with teenagers from the area to get their views as to what they would like to see put in there this is another way of trying to cater for as many people as we can from the student coming in to research a project to the oap who wants to stop in for a chat and to read the newspaper
4413523 a portal not a party organiser it is somewhere to come for ideas and to buy the gear some of which is not on sale anywhere else in ireland
4413524 when you think that for almost every wedding there is a hen party
4413525 you can see the massive market that is out there
4413526 it has got to the stage now that you could spend as much going to a hens as to a wedding
4413527 the days when a hen party only meant the all day drinking session and dancing on the tables at closing time are gone
4413528 of course there is drink involved in most cases and everyone is out for a good time but that is not all there is to it
4413529 i was at a hens myself in which we sailed in a yacht around cork harbour drinking champagne followed by dinner and a night in a good hotel
4413530 being on a reality tv show is certainly something different
4413531 even with the economic situation this is a solid market

4413534 i had a strip per for my hen and i loved it loads of people think the hen will hate it but i dont think this is true i loved every minute of it
4413535 waterford on any weekend could have a dozen hen parties visiting i think it is taking over from kilkenny which used to be the place to go

4413539 i wont say its a big worry because the economy itself is very well balanced we dont see too many asset bubbles we see general consumption confidence staying well and people are still investing even though they dont invest in anything short term but looking for long term returns the economy is still quite healthy in that sense
4413540 we seem to have less tolerance for inflation now both socially and economically since the last down cycle the economy has recovered but income disparity has also grown so for those in the lower income group they may have less tolerance for higher inflation

4413588 now the make up had to have helped hannah seriously
4413589 it is ironic because for a large number of patients with ards it is the treatment rather the syndrome which ends up killing them
4413590 now we apply tidal volumes normalized per ideal body weight of six to eight ml kg down from 12 to 15
4413591 the consequences are of course potentially more dangerous in patients in which the chest wall elastance is more compromised and the lung volume is more reduced
4413592 the immediate clinical implications are that clinicians should not trust the conventional measurements
4413593 pharmacotherapy with salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate or the components reduces the rate of decline on fev1 in patients with moderate to severe copd thus slowing disease progression
4413594 to date smoking cessation is the only intervention that has conclusively been shown to alter the rate of decline in fev1
4413595 the rate of decline in fev1 was slowest in patients on sfc and fastest in those randomized to the placebo arm
4413596 from week 24 onward the adjusted rate of decline in fev1 was 39ml year for sfc 42 ml year for both sal and fp and 55 ml year for placebo
4413597 although treatment did not abolish the accelerated decline in lung function that occurs with copd it did ameliorate it substantially
4413598 the mechanism responsible for the effect on rate of decline is not clear as all treatments have potentially significant nonbronchodilator effects
4413599 we wanted to investigate what was behind the observed sex differences in asthma rates and ar
4413600 this is the first study to prospectively examine the natural history of sex differences in asthma in this manner
4413601 while our results were not unexpected they do point to intriguing potential mechanisms to explain the gender differences in asthma incidence and severity especially intriguing is that the differences in gender begin at the time of transition into early puberty
4413602 it will be of great interest to follow these children over time to see what happens with ar and severity of asthma in adulthood
4413603 quel momento quellistante in cui le tue dita stringono i manici di una borsa nuova fiammante e tutte le splendide cose allinterno diventano tue cosa si prova e come aver digiunato per giorni e quindi riempirsi la bocca di pane tostato imburrato e come svegliarsi e realizzare in un attimo che sabato e come il sesso nei suoi momenti migliori qualunque altra cosa spazzata via dalla tua mente e un piacere fine a se stesso allo stato puro
4413604 imam khomeini said this regime that is occupying qods jerusalem must be eliminated from the pages of history this sentence is very wise the issue of palestine is not an issue on which we can compromise
4413605 the world without zionism the text of the speech was posted online in persian by the iranian student news agency www isnagency com
4413606 although the main solution is for the elimination of the zionist regime at this stage an immediate cease fire must be implemented
4413607 o dear imam khomeini you said the zionist regime that is a usurper and illegitimate regime and a cancerous tumor should be wiped off the map the zionist regime faces a complete deadend and under gods grace your wish will soon be materialized and the corrupt element will be wiped off the map

4413644 is advising the 2008 presidential exploratory committee for brownback a longtime social conservative who converted to catholicism a few years ago
4413645 in the catholic community hes looked upon as kind of on the fringes
4413646 the worldview is we have to get back to a catholic civilization they want to go back to a christian society imposed from above its just another world they want to build
4413647 i thought it was disgusting and now i dont want another guy to kiss me before marriage

4413649 here at ave maria we follow the teachings of the magisterium
4413650 we have not prostituted ourselves other catholic schools and the rest of america have embraced modernism and the culture of death they have given wholehearted support to the death penalty abortion and euthanasia the value of the human person is now entirely relative
4413651 we dont believe in the separation of church and state
4413652 and this country should orient itself toward christ the foundation of western civilization rests on christendom which means that america owes its existence to the catholic church
4413653 we saw an environment where the free expression of the human spirit is thwarted

4413658 with this team i dont think nervous is even a factor until you get a couple of outs in the seventh
4413659 i really felt that in the canada game we needed someone to come out there and throw zeroes up until we could get the bats going
4413660 and the way cats been pitching i figured we could count on her to come through
4413661 i was ready to go if he needed me against japan and he changed things up at the last second which was fine we just have to all be ready at any point in time there are only three of us pitchers its all about matchups right now and who theyre throwing
4413662 but i felt good out there on the mound weve played canada enough times and i know their hitters really well i felt like i was on a roll with them if we got one run and went ahead that would be ok but we obviously went ahead and put quite a few on the board
4413663 its not that we dont think about ever losing its just that we know what were capable of doing in the fifth inning you still have two at bats to go and we have a deep enough lineup that you cant get through 1 9 in our lineup without facing 1 9 good hitters
4413664 were not really dominant like people say we are we play a lot of competitive tournaments all around the world every year the difference is that the only time people really pay attention and see is in the olympics and we were dominant in athens we were flat out the best team
4413665 obviously we know that we have a bulls eye on our back all the time and the good thing is that we have athletes who thrive on that theyre very competitive and they understand the history of this program and do their part to prepare themselves thats why theyre in that uniform because theyre ready

4413713 most people do not really want freedom because freedom involves responsibility and most people are frightened of responsibility
4413714 in order to live your freedom you must first accept reality these are the choices and given those choices which do i choose whether the option you select is pleasant or painful does not alter the fact that given reality this is your preference
4413715 to live your freedom it is helpful to stop and ask yourself why am i doing this and then notice whether given the options you are choosing what you really want or whether you want to choose something else sometimes the exercise of freedom involves naming your poison all choices may lead to outcomes that are in some way painful but the real pain is that of feeling powerless denying your freedom

4413779 i am using the expedition as a catalyst to generate ideas for my artwork which i will exhibit in 2009 but also to generate discussion and debate about the arctic which is one of the most precious and endangered places in the world
4413780 its always been my ambition to walk through the arctic and live in its wild environment ever since i was a little girl and saw it on tv i see it as an opportunity to find out more about myself and the world we live in
4413781 i want to use the trip as the inspiration for different art projects and involve my local communities and the communities ill be visiting in the arctic
4413782 i see it as much more than an artist going on expedition its a chance to educate share my experiences and be creative

4413789 but i have seen the city do an unbelievable sky redcaps and dining car attendants who wouldnt think of moving out of the city sometimes go on at great lengths about country skies they have seen from the windows of trains but there is nothing to beat what the city can make of a nightsky it can empty itself of surface and more like the ocean than the ocean itself go deep starless close up on the tops of buildings near nearer than the cap you are wearing such a citysky presses and retreats presses and retreats making me think of the free but illegal love of sweethearts before they are discovered
4413790 the minutes gathered into hours but still she sat motionless a disdainful smile or an angry frown passing now and then across her face somewhere in the room a little clock ticked time away somewhere outside a whippoorwill wailed evening died a sweet smell of early southern flowers rushed in on a newly risen breeze which suddenly parted the thin silk curtains at the opened windows a slender frail glass vase fell from the sill with a tingling crash but helga crane did not shift her position and the night grew cooler and older
4413791 but still she sat motionless a disdainful smile or an angry frown passing now and then across her face
4413792 one of the biggest issues in quebec was that people werent recognizing that people were getting sick with this disease early enough and there was transmission happening within the hospital
4413793 the same thing was happening in ontario and occasionally we have seen it out here
4413794 we have had some cases of that strain here and it is very likely that some of these cases were
4413795 we can tell very rapidly whether a person is infected with a toxin secreting strain of c difficile
4413796 but to find the genetic code to see if it has the part of the gene that causes it to be a hyper secreting strain takes a long time
4413797 its just so easy to transmit infections between people not just c diff
4413798 sars really made it hit home that there was transmission between people in multi bed rooms and to people coming in to visit them
4413799 with the present climate there is not a chance in hell that we are going to reach an agreement with these folks
4413800 the reality for us this time is that we believe that we will get a fairer deal in arbitration than we will from the police services board
4413801 over the last decade it has always been recognized within bargaining that toronto officers need to be compensated to become the highest paid
4413802 no responsible employer would want to enter into such an agreement
4413803 i wouldnt say its lockstep but certainly we very much keep an eye on what is happening in the same way we do with toronto fire
4413804 the general labour relations atmosphere that we are currently under in this city it is pathetic it is commensurate with the labour relations relationship that we had pre 2002
4413805 he has got a great deal of potential and i dont think it will be long before the fans see him in a blue and white shirt
4413806 both crystal palace and blackburn rovers were interested in him and hes someone ive had my eye on for some time now importantly hes a big fan of the club so thats a step in the right direction
4413807 its a dream come true for me ive been a town fan all my life and i wanted to play here i had a trial at palace and a weeks trial at blackburn and they made an offer but i only wanted to play for huddersfield town
4413808 boothy huddersfield forward andy booth is my hero and im looking forward to meeting up with the lads this weekend
4413809 both vanoc and john furlong and we the government of b c are very interested in working together to showcase the best of food and wines from b c
4413810 theres been no advantage in being a b c producer in supplying the olympics its a little frustrating that more is not being done to promote locally grown produce
4413811 our members are really anxious to seize on the opportunities from the olympics
4413812 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4413813 we had made these arrangements for this round of negotiations before the conflict in georgia and so we just merely continued with the schedule we had
4413814 we believe that missile defence is a substantial contribution to natos collective security
4413815 for non lawgeeks the decision wont seem important but trust me this is huge
4413816 in non technical terms the court has held that free licenses such as the cc licenses set conditions rather than covenants on the use of copyrighted work when you violate the condition the license disappears meaning youre simply a copyright infringer this is the theory of the gpl and all cc licenses put precisely whether or not they are also contracts they are copyright licenses which expire if you fail to abide by the terms of the license
4413817 we are working very hard with the ministry of children and youth to make sure that whatever needs to be done will be done whatever changes need to be made will be made whatever we need to strengthen will be done to make sure that our children our most vulnerable are protected
4413818 that parents feel compelled to monitor their children on this scale should send a powerful message to the big social networking sites
4413819 with three quarters of a million underage users in the uk
4413820 children are at the vanguard of the social networking phenomenon using social network sites in the same way other generations used the telephone
4413821 with the summer holidays upon us and kids spending hours on the internet busy parents cant be expected to monitor their childrens activities all the time
4413822 effectively in the interests of the people of the russian federation
4413823 the goals set in the course of the operation were met
4413824 we will call things by their own names the people of south ossetia survived genocide the fact that the destruction of almost an entire people was stopped was legal unavoidable and absolutely justified
4413825 they felt as though they were surrounded by people like being in a crowded elevator dismalites add sparkle to canyon
4413826 our defense has been the most consistent thing this season but our bats have been an emotional roller coaster
4413827 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4413828 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4413829 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4413830 the bottom line to it is john edwards and elizabeth edwards had no knowledge of anything i did
4413831 we have reached important agreements on natural gas and electricity issues god willing we will complete them as soon as possible
4413832 the level crossing is crossed by hundreds of thousands of motorists every day and theres not one single collision involving a train on impact sgt exton told the committal hearing for scholl
4413833 i saw the train and saw there was nowhere to go in front so i tried to swing to the left so i wouldnt hit the train he said
4413834 cest le r le de lentra neur de tenter de trouver une solution intelligente si tant est quil y en ait beaucoup

4413837 jeromes a young player that harry has always liked a quick wide player who is a good addition to the squad
4413838 the idea is that he comes here and proves himself if he plays to the ability we all know he has then he has a great chance of staying here longer so its in his hands
4413839 millions of human hands at work billions of minds a vast network screaming with life an organism a natural organism
4413840 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4413841 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4413842 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4413843 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4413844 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4413845 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4413846 cast a shadow over our efforts to normalise ties with pakistan
4413847 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4413848 we have intelligence inputs about extremist groups planning to target prominent leaders and symbols of national importance
4413849 i had to walk many miles to a school i had to study at night in the dim light of a kerosene light

4413852 it cant be open ended either geographically or in time
4413853 it has to be circumscribed and its got to be in the context of the russians withdrawing all their armed forces
4413854 if tomorrow president saakashvili signs these documents then the withdrawal of the russian troops can start
4413855 i think the sentence is a bit light he should face a harsher sentence because he has committed a crime against a child
4413856 its been like this as far as i can remember we build houses then fighting occurs we leave and return home and build our houses again
4413857 being alive after all the troubles just makes me thankful despite the difficulties
4413858 i think quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively

4413880 some sad incidents happened at a time when we had a boom in the tourism industry it is as if the sun had set at noon
4413881 my effort will be bring the leaders of the agitation to the table so that all the problems are resolved
4413882 thanks to the help of aid workers like these real progress has been made in improving the lives of the afghan people
4413883 they were travelling in white toyota land cruisers that were clearly marked as irc vehicles as humanitarian vehicles
4413884 their policy was never to travel with weapons in the car so there wouldnt be any doubt that theyre a peaceful humanitarian organisation
4413885 words are inadequate to express our sympathy for the families and loved ones of the victims and our devoted team of humanitarian aid workers in afghanistan
4413886 many thousands of children are alive today thanks to aid work on improving health standards six million children are now in education two million of them girls compared to one million boys with girls banned from schools under the taliban
4413887 in contrast the insurgents have nothing to offer the afghan people other than more killings and intimidation
4413888 even in their absence the court believes it has authority to proceed with the case
4413889 gottlieb was one of the most incredible people i have ever seen
4413890 die erg nzung unseres modellprogramms durch diesen au ergew hnlich gezeichneten kombi ist ein wichtiger schritt in der fortschreitenden weltweiten expansion von cadillac wir wissen dass kombis insbesondere auf internationalen m rkten eine wichtige rolle spielen
4413891 we do not have enough women police to search the pilgrims
4413892 during the day it is possible to identify them but at night it is more difficult because of the burqa sometimes you cannot even tell if they are men or women
4413893 we will investigate any information that is passed to us and ensure it is accurate before responding in a proportionate and measured way
4413894 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned
4413895 however these types of enquiries can be complex and may take time to resolve
4413896 in reality this project has no relation to the iranian missile threat but is aimed against russia
4413897 this is an important agreement for the security of the united states for the security of poland and the security of our nato allies
4413898 its still long if i come back next year it will be shorter
4413899 all three felt that lara would be the first one to do it for them
4413900 it was one of those moments you never want to experience
4413901 the girls felt they did their job and a weight was lifted off their shoulders the first time any healing started was there they were relieved they had done it for her
4413902 i dont think i could have found the strength to do what they did
4413903 she set the tone for meets when she had a good day the team had a good day
4413904 it was tough for the players to go through that so they did what they had to do in order to stay loose
4413905 i told my kids to play loose because we were going to play one of the contenders coming into this tournament
4413906 i think they know that when i get messy i get determined and i figure it out for myself
4413907 we would like to publicly thank and acknowledge all the wonderful caring people of our community
4413908 over the past month we have received and been supported by thoughts prayers and individual kindnesses from close friends family and even relative strangers it has in a word been amazing

4413922 is i found out things about her i didnt know
4413923 tim needs to go at least six innings brad is a bull he pitched complete games all year for winnacunnet high school and he pitched a big one for us in the state tournament
4413924 if we pitch and play defense like we did in the state tournament well be ok itll depend on how deep our pitching goes
4413925 i need to have him play second base because im not going to dh him for tim or brad when theyre pitching
4413926 but taking over the offense that happens later right now im just trying to get into the groove get everything clicking and get everyone on the same page
4413927 the one thing you wonder about is the durability hes got to understand that 20 plays into 2004 ricky santos had to take somebodys place thats why backup kevin deckers got to feel like hes the starter and theres going to be competition
4413928 me and r j played together freshman year so im used to him
4413929 hes a very good quarterback so its easy for the receivers to adjust and its easy for r j to adjust were a tight team
4413930 it has all the makings of a real good line
4413931 were all trying to get the chemistry this camp so we can work well heading into the season
4413932 somewhere along the line out of those seven or eight guys weve got to get four guys who can start and others who can come in and play
4413933 were going to try to do what we did two years ago with dan wagner brendan st peter and marvin wright inside and on the outside trying to get three of them in a rotation
4413934 the opener is definitely going to fly by and be here before we know it
4413935 but the key is you cant look ahead 3 weeks youve got to focus on getting better and better day by day
4413936 reporting was once a way to get sustainability issues onto the corporate agenda today the situation is reversing as a growing number of companies make ambitious commitments to sustainability there is much business as usual but these targets matter because what gets measured gets done and hopefully reported against this shift in where the agenda is set holds real potential to influence products and services and eventually to shape business models of the future reporting will be important but will need explicitly to make clearer links between sustainability issues and core business strategy something that all stakeholders including the mainstream investment community seem to agree upon
4413937 but taking over the offense that happens later right now im just trying to get into the groove get everything clicking and get everyone on the same page
4413938 the one thing you wonder about is the durability hes got to understand that 20 plays into 2004 ricky santos had to take somebodys place thats why backup kevin deckers got to feel like hes the starter and theres going to be competition

4413957 when he settles in when there are runners on base he executes pitches
4413958 he gets comfortable gets in his delivery and gets in the flow of the game and really pitches well
4413959 we got all those runs near the beginning of the game so i should have been able to go out there and get outs at a better pace but i wasnt able to
4413960 i felt like i was struggling to get into a good groove all game
4413961 of course youre embarrassed were all embarrassed because we feel were better than that
4413962 our bullpen definitely didnt need to be in there for nine innings i wish i would have done better
4413963 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs this pay offer is an insult to professional hard working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions
4413964 this result is just the first to be declared with positive ballot results expected over the next few days at stansted and manchester airports
4413965 traffic has slowed down back to junction 17 but it is still moving
4413966 this arrangement is sequel to a new memorandum of understanding mou jointly signed by nigeria liberia and the un
4413967 the nigerian army troops were charged with the responsibility of providing security in liberian capital and most volatile parts of the country
4413968 because of the confidence we have in nigeria un mission thinks it has the capability and efficiency to do the work
4413969 im going now to talk to president saakashvili about the clarifications that the french have provided and then well try to get this formal ceasefire in place because the goal of this is to get a ceasefire and to get russian forces to withdraw from the country asap
4413970 a great milestone in the history of the two countries
4413971 we are saddled with the painful but most important task of handing over bakassi to cameroon we have commitments to the international community to promote peace and brotherliness between our countries
4413972 it is believed that if african leaders observe the rule of law the continent will be a more peaceful place
4413973 historic moment showing brotherly celebration of cooperation between the two countries
4413974 we in the un are happy about the handover what is important is that the handover is done at last
4413975 it has helped to douse tension generated by the ceremony
4413976 it is a wise decision and i think there must be good reason for it
4413977 after the handing over there will be buses and escort to convey you to the new bakassi for you to conduct interview
4413978 a good number of the senators were there at the national assembly when former president obasanjo and his cameroonian counter part were negotiating this issue why did they not shout only for this injunctive order to be issued at the wee hours of the day why didnt they tell the whole world their position then a good number of them were busy looking for a return to the national assembly
4413979 if you play him enough times hes bound to have an off day
4413980 my hopes for the season are to qualify for the ncaa or ecac tournaments
4413981 we had a strong season last year and want to improve
4413982 the small school provides a close knit family for me which made my transition from home very easy i am fortunate that i get to play with some of the most talented soccer players and genuinely amazing people that ive ever met
4413983 the biggest difference that ive experienced from high school to college soccer is the quality of players and teams in high school it was possible to not play at your best for a game and it wouldnt be that big of a deal but with the teams we play now if you have a rough game you can have an unfavorable result
4413984 our team had dedicated our last season and the upcoming one to corey worsham
4413985 we spent hundreds of games playing together on various raymond teams as well as an olympic development program team
4413986 i was playing indoor and outdoor soccer recreationally i had had a baby a couple of years earlier but i was looking for something else to do
4413987 a friend of mine had done the timberman and said she had a horrible experience in the swim for me that made it sound exciting and challenging during the swim youre getting kicked and punched and people are swimming over you
4413988 in december of 2006 i bought a bike and joined a triathlon club in north andover mass called tri fury i did six last year all sprints and one duathlon biking and running this year i will have done eight by the time the year is over
4413989 maybe before im 50 im 44 now maybe as a 50th birthday present to myself
4413990 last year i did pretty well considering i just started every race i map out how much time i want to knock off and what point in positioning realistically i want to be in obviously i would love to go one two three
4413991 ive done very well and hired a coach working with sharon johnson out of the north andover ymca
4413992 im in better physical condition than i have ever been but it takes lot of a sacrifice and to do it competitively takes even more
4413993 i had my first daughter and i went in for a physical i had high blood pressure and high cholesterol so i got myself on a treadmill
4413994 my in laws approached me with the idea of doing the timberman
4413995 a lot of them do it i signed up not having any idea if i would be able to finish i was 273 pounds and went down to 202
4413996 i had never done these kinds of things before as a kid i never had any interest in them but there was the challenge of doing something new and the excitement of going further and faster
4413997 the other big part is that now when i go out training the kids abigail age 2 and allison age 4 they pretend how they will do it someday so its a positive influence
4413998 ive met a lot of nice people through the online community and at races
4413999 i started in 2005 and to this point ive only done one a year the timberman it wasnt until this year that i gained the confidence to do more next year more like to the moose man which is olympic length
4414000 this is something i can do and still have a life
4414001 an hour or hour and a half a day of training still gives you time for a life
4414002 a crisis situation means that you dont have time to listen to aids messages
4414003 but the problem is youre not in the room with the girls when they are alone with a customer
4414004 if eager for money you do it without a condom if you want to protect your life you dont
4414005 two thousand naira roughly us 17 what some women charge for sex without a condom cannot cure the sickness inside my body as a result of hiv i have seen money had a lot of it im too young to die its not because of greed that ill go and mess up my life
4414006 all i know is i get the money i f
4414007 if i dont die as a result of aids i still go die i only know god wont let that happen
4414008 they tell me to wear one but i no fit do am i cant do it with condom
4414009 zehn sch nsten und begehrtesten m dchen der olympischen spiele
4414010 vier jahre geld ausgeben f r 270 minuten h sslichkeiten
4414011 in wirklichkeit spielen sie aber volles risiko und sie haben leider alles verloren
4414012 i think its a little sweeter knowing ive been through some injuries and some doubters
4414013 but honestly i think it just made me so much stronger and made me the person i am today its been a long journey but every single moment has been worth it
4414014 she has a tiger inside her she was very strong today
4414015 i knew i really didnt have much of a chance to catch liukin
4414016 at that point i didn t really care where i placed i just wanted to finish my olympic experience with the best routine i could i wanted to represent the united states
4414017 i wasnt thinking about whether i was going to make it or not
4414018 i was thinking about how i was going to make it thats something that my dad has always taught me go in being so confident that you know youre going to make it and then just do the little corrections as you go
4414019 there were positive and negative surprises the ebit was better than expected gaining from the margin levels sales were a bit below my expectations and also below the pace of growth of competitor richemont
4414020 the market realized the loss in the chinese retailer xinyu which is estimated at 47 million swiss francs 42 78 million but underestimated the losses from their investments in equities and bonds
4414021 equity markets were down 21 0 in swiss francs in the first half of the year
4414022 despite all the negative reports of the financial sector and the increase in costs worldwide the group management still expects sales and profitability to show solid positive development in the second half year
4414023 one of the biggest things affecting us will be the loss of the ferries
4414024 we will probably have to stop trading for 24 hours because there will be no ferries for my trucks to go on
4414025 ill be paying the men to do nothing and i dont think stopping essential lifeline services will be doing council employees much good
4414026 theyre going to get no sympathy from me or my customers
4414027 i will be trying to get trucks and men in the right place the night before the strike but its not looking good
4414028 we normally export fish from the fishing boats at cullivoe pier down to the lerwick fishmarket but we wont be able to do that
4414029 theyre not needing to tie up the boats full stop and its certainly going to lower my opinion of the council
4414030 we have a great working relationship with the ferry men and they do their best for us every day of the week
4414031 its the fact they are taking their problems out on joe public rather than their employer that is the problem
4414032 the council is not going to lose out on wednesday because they will save on fuel
4414033 i heard one anonymous comment on radio shetland saying everyone should be sacked and strikes didnt solve anything but sacking everybody would
4414034 the fact so many people are employed by the council mean people know what the situation is and why it is necessary
4414035 none of us want to go on strike its just striking is the only thing workers can do to get employers to know how bad things are
4414036 its the last resort the workforce has up its sleeve
4414037 we appreciate the community is going to suffer but most of them will be council workers themselves or related to other council workers so they will know how bad the situation is
4414038 ive every sympathy with the council employees but they are tackling the wrong target because the council is powerless to increase the national offer so i dont know why they are doing this
4414039 most councillors would sympathise with the workers but the government hasnt made the money available
4414040 its very difficult for folk in bressay a lot of people will have to stay in lerwick for the night or lose money
4414041 perhaps to increase workers wages we could make cuts and fire some people to pay those who are left a little more money but we dont want to do that
4414042 mr smith should be directing his attack on the government and not on shetland islands council
4414043 my gut reaction is weve been given plenty of notice and most islanders are fairly resilient about these kind of things so i dont think it will cause too much trouble
4414044 im neutral about whether im sympathetic to the cause or not but i think people have to demonstrate their feelings as best they can
4414045 its unfortunate for people that have to go to work on the mainland but we do sometimes have to put up with the loss of ferries because of weather
4414046 im disappointed it has come to this stage id like to see what came out of the talks before they went down this road
4414047 if theres a problem with anybody in fair isle that comes to my attention i will bring it up
4414048 i cant see there being any chance of a last minute reprieve at all
4414049 i had started going up towards tingwall and had passed the turn off for the west side at approximately 9 45am when i heard what can only be described as an explosion
4414050 i knew something had happened because i was starting to lose power and i could see my rev counter fluctuating
4414051 i thought i would pull in at the windy grind to phone for help
4414052 there was a hay amp co lorry and a taxi who were both waving at me to get my attention
4414053 i knew something had happened but i never knew the cab was actually on fire
4414054 when i looked in my mirrors i could see smoke so i pulled on my handbrake and got out of the cab
4414055 by the time i had run 60 yards it had gone up in a ball of fire
4414056 i was amazed at how fast it was burning i was surprised at how ferociously the fire had spread in such a short time
4414057 i want to thank the fire brigade at tingwall airport and scalloway and lerwick as well
4414058 we could see from just above the herrislea houses to where the fire was
4414059 there was really a lot of black smoke and then the lorry stopped
4414060 there was fire and lots and lots of black smoke a jbt lorry came along and stopped beside it and there was another lorry that blocked the traffic so cars couldnt get through
4414061 then the fire engine came up the road and there was white smoke and steam i did wonder what had happened i wondered if it had hit something because from where we were it looked like it was on the wrong side of the road although it wasnt the cab of the lorry was completely black and there were bits of it falling off
4414062 no documents declaring georgias withdrawal from the cis have been handed in
4414063 i could tell by the doctors demeanour it was bad news he said he was almost sure it was cancer my wife and i were both shocked
4414064 they came to a diagnosis that was wrong but it was enough for the surgeon to take the lung out they told me so definitely that it was cancer it was black and white i believed them 100 per cent
4414065 at first i was just exhilarated to be alive i was told i didnt have cancer but it didnt register but after a while i began to get frustrated because no one could tell me why my lung had to be removed
4414066 when i got home i read the medical notes that i had been given to hand over to my employers bp with a view to being medically retired the notes said no malignancy found and this was underlined it was then i decided to claim compensation i contacted solicitors who would work on a no win no fee basis and they told me i had a strong case
4414067 i felt an obligation to keep myself fit because i was a firefighter
4414068 i cant do any of the things i used to do although im grateful to family and friends for their help ive suffered a massive deterioration of my health and a huge financial loss through losing my job
4414069 i have to get people in i cant even hang a sheet of wallpaper
4414070 my wife and family have been robbed we are suffering the consequences of an error made by other people were paying for it
4414071 there are no words to describe it our life has changed dramatically he cant do anything he used to do he stays at home and watches the telly he cant even pick his grandchildren up hes in pain and has to take morphine twice a day
4414072 i just want the medical team to say theyve made a mistake and for the health board to share the financial consequences theyve taken five years of lauries working life he was building up to retirement and its been snatched away
4414073 if pathology is a judgement call not an exact science why arent more pathologists involved why is all that responsibility on one person even if no one individual is guilty of incompetence or negligence i still believe i have a valid and legitimate claim for the error
4414074 it would be intolerable if they the health board are able to walk away after a horrendous blunder that removes a persons health and quality of life without bearing any consequences
4414075 nobody thought it wasnt cancer it was a non controversial decision its almost as if we would do the same tomorrow and cant give a 100 per cent guarantee it wont happen again
4414076 it is most unfortunate and deeply regrettable but it was not a blunder of an individual doctor or pathologist all the indications were that he had cancer and we had to come to a decision
4414077 it was such an unfortunate coincidence all the investigations pointed one way and cancer was not there
4414078 he is pursuing a case for financial compensation and theres nothing wrong with that but his personal grief could be helped by a meeting im sure wed all feel better
4414079 if we havent done anything wrong there will be no legal case but it doesnt take away that something happened
4414080 the team are all devastated and mr balls case has been the subject of endless discussion to prevent such a case in future but very little has come out of it
4414081 it is a good team and our lung cancer survival figures are the best in scotland im so proud of that team and that makes it even worse
4414082 i have been working with mr ball and his family to assist him in his case against nhs grampian
4414083 what this case has made clear is that there is a need for a better way of handling nhs compensation cases when errors are made
4414084 there should instead be a speedy no blame compensation scheme for the victims of mistakes by the health service i shall certainly be taking this case to the health minister asking her to recognise the serious flaws in the current position and urging her to introduce a fairer no blame compensation scheme
4414085 greater barriers to obtaining compensation in scotland than the rest of the world
4414086 theyve been arriving in record numbers the biggest flock was 18 at sumburgh head which was completely unpreceden ted
4414087 theyve been arriving in shetland for the last two to three weeks the first one was spotted in fair isle and then from the middle of last week other groups have been arriving
4414088 theyre not going to find much larch but when they are outside of their areas they tend to adapt and feed on what they can find
4414089 theyll keep moving for a feed and over the next month or so they will start to move further south
4414090 it is ironic because for a large number of patients with ards it is the treatment rather the syndrome which ends up killing them
4414091 now we apply tidal volumes normalized per ideal body weight of six to eight ml kg down from 12 to 15
4414092 the consequences are of course potentially more dangerous in patients in which the chest wall elastance is more compromised and the lung volume is more reduced
4414093 the immediate clinical implications are that clinicians should not trust the conventional measurements
4414094 if we could decrease with more refined measurements the mortality rate due to mechanical ventilation by 4 5 percent this could save up to 7500 lives in the u s if we accept that ali ards has an incidence of 150000 year
4414095 pharmacotherapy with salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate or the components reduces the rate of decline on fev1 in patients with moderate to severe copd thus slowing disease progression
4414096 to date smoking cessation is the only intervention that has conclusively been shown to alter the rate of decline in fev1
4414097 the rate of decline in fev1 was slowest in patients on sfc and fastest in those randomized to the placebo arm
4414098 from week 24 onward the adjusted rate of decline in fev1 was 39ml year for sfc 42 ml year for both sal and fp and 55 ml year for placebo
4414099 although treatment did not abolish the accelerated decline in lung function that occurs with copd it did ameliorate it substantially
4414100 the mechanism responsible for the effect on rate of decline is not clear as all treatments have potentially significant nonbronchodilator effects
4414101 the torch study brings some clarity to the treatment picture and provides some hopeful signs for patients with copd
4414102 this study also demonstrates that no treatment placebo is not an option for patients with moderate to severe copd
4414103 we wanted to investigate what was behind the observed sex differences in asthma rates and ar
4414104 this is the first study to prospectively examine the natural history of sex differences in asthma in this manner
4414105 while our results were not unexpected they do point to intriguing potential mechanisms to explain the gender differences in asthma incidence and severity especially intriguing is that the differences in gender begin at the time of transition into early puberty
4414106 it will be of great interest to follow these children over time to see what happens with ar and severity of asthma in adulthood
4414107 we are now able to perform a secondary analysis with an emphasis on those who have reached clinical normalcy
4414108 i decided that i had come this far and didnt want to let them down so i wrestled
4414109 this will be my last match i wanted to take gold so i consider this olympics a failure
4414110 certainly one can always question decisions made in the course of refereeing but in sports it is appropriate to show sportsmanship and accept the results
4414111 the green fuel as we call it the alcool i especially nowadays when we talk about environmental responsibilities i think is extremely important to the world
4414112 the united states has an objective to blend 10 and then 20 percent of ethanol in their gasoline
4414113 this will be a huge amount of ethanol and that will open opportunities to the ethanol imported from other countries
4414114 the dominance of the agricultural sector is paramount with lulas government

4414116 sumburgh is our second busiest airport and provides essential air links to the mainland for the people of shetland
4414117 this capital investment demonstrates a strong commitment to the airport and the services it provides for the communities and economy of the islands
4414118 most of the current lighting system is now approaching the end of its life so this investment will ensure continuity of service at the airport and that we provide a facility that meets the needs of our scheduled flight and oil industry customers
4414119 we are always looking for brands that will complement what we already offer and that will also round out our selection and fill a niche that we have not yet reached out to

4414133 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4414134 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4414135 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4414136 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4414178 i just feel safer when i walk down the street with a man who is much taller than me
4414179 i am only attracted to tall men i just cant help it

4414193 i dont think these organizations would have been able to undertake the type of regulatory work they do without this type of model
4414194 im very disappointed for a professional organization like the tssa i would have expected they would have reliable and accurate information they could report to the public

4414203 the steady drum beat of double digit sales declines this year is beginning to weigh more heavily on prices
4414204 the provincial economy isnt exactly holding up too well so we certainly cant rule out a future price decrease in the toronto market
4414205 its not improbable since the trajectory is downward and the market is definitely past its prime
4414206 most likely due to the moderate economic growth and the increased choice in the resale market

4414241 gold production is stagnating and output in the leading gold producing countries continues to fall year on year despite higher gold prices leading geologists to wonder whether we may have or may soon have reached the point of peak gold production the worlds biggest producer south africa produced nearly 1 000 tonnes of gold in 1980 this was down to 264 tonnes last year the lowest since 1932
4414242 the china gold association announced that chinas gold output was expected to reach 300 tons in 2008 surpassing that of south africa and making china the worlds largest gold producer
4414243 surpassed the united states as the worlds second largest gold producer in 2007 with 270 491 tons of output
4414244 gold and silver are cheap vs many commodities and oil
4414245 the long term average gold to oil ratio is 15 to 1 or 15 barrels of oil to one ounce of gold
4414246 gold has traded at over 30 times a barrel of oil
4414247 should there be a classic reversion to the mean average of 4 4 in the ratio of ounces of silver per barrel of oil then silver prices would rise to 30 per ounce and silver is selling at less than half that price right now
4414248 things that are out of whack tend to get back into whack
4414249 my business has plummeted because of all these blocked roads
4414250 the situation is very bad the whole city center is clogged and full of checkpoints
4414251 after the police blocked the roads we lost all of our business
4414252 weve complained many times to the government and asked them to allow potential customers through the checkpoints but they dont care the government doesnt care about this nation
4414253 if terrorists bomb everywhere in the city does that mean the government will close all of the roads so that we cant go anywhere
4414254 the government is only blocking roads to protect themselves not the people
4414255 i feel that i could die at any moment if im at the wrong place at the wrong time
4414256 kabul is becoming a garrison city as it prepares for each attack
4414257 there were far more suicide attacks in kabul in 2007 than in 2008 this year the number has fallen dramatically and the police presence might be a factor in this
4414258 the majority of the violence is occurring in specific districts of the country
4414259 when afghans read about violent incidents elsewhere they tend to feel insecure about their own situation even if they are not in danger
4414260 all these so called nontraditional capabilities have moved into the mainstream of military thinking planning and strategy where they must stay
4414261 rumsfelds dismal strategic decisions resulted in the unnecessary deaths of american servicemen and women
4414262 responsible for america and her allies going to war with the wrong plan
4414263 violated fundamental principles of war dismissed deliberate military planning ignored the hard work to build the peace after the fall of saddam hussein set the conditions for abu ghraib and other atrocities that further ignited the insurgency disbanded iraqi security force institutions when we needed them most and constrained our commanders with an overly restrictive policy
4414264 with like minded and compliant subordinates who did not grasp the importance of the principles of war the complexities of iraq or the human dimension of warfare
4414265 tied the hands of commanders while our troops were in contact with the enemy
4414266 the most significant transformation in the american conduct of war since world war ii and the invention of the atomic bomb was not technological but cultural social and political the removal of the american people from the conduct of war
4414267 security is no longer an issue its never mentioned by our customers or even by the government any more
4414268 in terms of market india has the biggest potential in telecom and we want india to become our biggest market outside of china
4414269 we want our india research and development center to support our global operations leveraging indias english language skills and software expertise to our advantage globally
4414270 how indian and chinese comparative advantages can be combined for use globally
4414271 i would say huawei is chinas most successful multinational it is on the leading edge of china going international
4414272 the sector needed shaking up and that is what huawei has achieved
4414273 less than 0 5 of huaweis total business is conducted with the chinese government
4414274 i think far from being beholden to the state huawei in many ways sees itself as above the state
4414275 for years my administration has been calling on congress to expand domestic oil production unfortunately democrats on capital hill have rejected every proposal and now americans are paying at the pump as the democratically controlled congress has sat idle gas prices have continued to increase the american people are watching the numbers climb higher and higher at the pump and theyre waiting to see what the congress will do
4414276 when president george w bush eliminated the executive moratorium on offshore drilling a month ago effectively launching the drill drill drill offensive oil was close to 150 a barrel since then the barrel price has dropped to nearly 120 as futures market traders anticipate a major shift in federal drilling policy
4414277 without even realizing it the gop drilling offensive has become a new contract with america
4414278 and it appears to be working the public is putting aside global warming and choosing instead new energy production a stronger economy and more job creation voters want growth not austerity they want ronald reagan not thomas malthus
4414279 what the milf is asking for are the four elements of an independent state namely territory sovereignty people and governance so are we ready to become like kosovo a state within a state

4414301 working on your career makes you more valuable in your company and in the marketplace it provides you with the type of security that doesnt come with a job but which comes from being a thought leader in your area continually stretch the bounds of your work through rich interaction with both people and ideas youll be rewarded with an aliveness that transcends any promotion you could receive and a satisfaction steeped equally in what you contribute and who youve become at this point you might have a mixture of feelings fear excitement discouragement wonder thats a good thing it means you are waking up to reality and whats possible youve lifted your head up to see the landscape more clearly going back to the day to day trenches will never be the same celebrate this new awareness and begin the journey
4414302 forgiveness is not the misguided act of condoning irresponsible hurtful behavior nor is it a superficial turning of the other cheek that leaves us feeling victimized and martyred rather it is the finishing of old business that allows us to experience the present free of contamination from the past
4414303 in a rhetorical argument a fact is a claim that an audience will accept as being true without requiring proof although they may ask for an explanation an opinion is a claim that an audience will not accept as true without proof and which after the proof is given the audience may well decide has only a limited truth i e its true in this case but not in other cases as audience may also decide that even though a fact is unassailable the interpretation or use of the fact is open to debate

4414317 the study of historical memory might therefore be defined as the study of a cultural struggle of contested truths of moments events or even texts in history that thresh out rival versions of the past which are in turn put to the service of the present

4414322 our economy remains very productive but it shares the gains with only a small slice
4414323 families with the lowest incomes are still suffering the most and continue to lose
4414324 what really matters is expenditures what a household can and does spend
4414325 if bill gatess income goes to zero he could still live a pretty good lifestyle spending his billions
4414326 family income has a big impact on whether you go to college and matters more than it ever did before
4414327 the income gaps are going to get bigger and next generation consequence is really severe
4414328 we expect that review to highlight deficiencies which we will address with expedient remedial measures
4414329 he said youre not going to say no when a chief asks you to do something
4414330 he had to recant he had to change it because he didnt physically see it
4414331 russias behavior over the past week has called into question the entire premise of that dialogue and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato
4414332 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4414333 the era in which the united states and russia considered one another an enemy or strategic threat has ended
4414334 for the territorial integrity of georgia to be respected and the cease fire agreement to be honored
4414335 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4414336 what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations
4414337 but by the same token my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4414338 will reexamine the entire gamut of our military to military activities with russia and will make changes as necessary and appropriate depending on russian actions in the days ahead
4414339 thats usually when i end it i end the hearing at that point you kind of look at the parents like i couldnt imagine kids talking in front of their parents like that
4414340 said maura mathers an rmv hearing officer in north attleborough
4414341 we have to follow the law and the law tells us we have to suspend and you have to comply
4414342 its just wrong they should be able to do that they should be able to give you a warning first
4414343 its brutal on the parents and its brutal on the kids because now shes got to get in another little kids car who doesnt know how to drive
4414344 you think i want my daughter in the front seat with some other little girl who just got her license no thats why when she says daddy i need a ride im right there

4414348 we need to give stoke a good welcome to the premier league
4414349 we need to be ruthless and give us the push to have a good season
4414350 we are going to aim for a top six finish
4414351 its a young team and their naivety will no doubt having me pulling my hair out at times
4414352 but i think it will be an exciting team full of enthusiasm and very fit and will hopefully be good enough to evolve into a team that can win promotion
4414353 i speak to jim magilton quite a lot and as much as i think the boys a good player its not a name weve ever discussed
4414354 were still looking to strengthen theres no doubt about it
4414355 ive got a couple of things out there and if one comes back well move quickly on it
4414356 as it is we have to continue to do our best in that field
4414357 were looking as i have all summer its an area wed love to strengthen because numerically we dont have a lot of variations
4414358 i have no doubt we will reach the final this year because my players have attained a new level of professionalism
4414359 we played well in the congo due to good defensive organisation which never gave our opponents a chance to threaten us mazembe would not have scored had the match lasted two days
4414360 jamarcus has been able to play at a big weight he really has phenomenal feet for that size to be able to move around for that size youre never going to play with him at 260 or 255 if you think thats impossible thats not his body i think as long as you are around 270 with him youre doing really well
4414361 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4414362 we had made these arrangements for this round of negotiations before the conflict in georgia and so we just merely continued with the schedule we had
4414363 we believe that missile defence is a substantial contribution to natos collective security
4414364 as far as we can tell from our conversations with the book industry people there has never been a trailer that did this
4414365 we dig all the same things and get ridiculously excited about whatever were working on we also throw fits whenever were told no by the man and sometimes to our detriment have a burned earth policy when it comes to doing a project the way we want fortunately we usually get the support needed to build our visions and madman atomic comics is a prime example of that image comics could not be more supportive in their backing me up with all my crazed paper dreams in madman atomic comics theyre just as jazzed as i am to invite darwyn and mutual pal and cool genius j bone on madman atomic comics 14
4414366 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4414367 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4414368 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4414369 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4414370 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4414371 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4414372 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4414373 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4414374 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4414375 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4414376 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4414377 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4414378 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4414379 es ist zu bedauern dass die amerikanische seite in einer zeit in der wir bereits in einer schwierigen situation sind das verh ltnis zwischen den usa und russland weiter belastet

4414390 we are never going to take our eye off our goal if we are distracted by small things how the devil can we win a test
4414391 were a good rugby team so i can understand why they would say that but you dont win tests in the papers
4414392 i think the afl are up there checking it right now and well obviously have a look at it later on today
4414393 we wanted it to be suitable to play an afl game we will demand that
4414394 were going out there today to train and well certainly have a look at it up close
4414395 i think more than ever if you have some players can miss a few games during the year is absolutely a good thing because they come back fresh and in a good head space and really looking forward to playing footy

4414408 we dont easily get the opportunity to thumb through the persons record collection a ringtone says as much about a person and its easier to get it across
4414409 if someone has downloaded a song by bob dylan or jimi hendrix to his cellphone this person is more than likely very pensive and interested in many different things its a sign that he or she is creative clever and open minded
4414410 people tend to sort each other into categories and the question is in which one do we land
4414411 each of us can have some influence in the categorisation positive or negative through the ringtones we select the image of a singing rabbit can be superimposed on the person holding the cellphone
4414412 what category the person lands in is up to the other person not just the owner of the cellphone theres little chance of something going amiss with a completely ordinary ringtone
4414413 i think the afl are up there checking it right now and well obviously have a look at it later on today

4414447 it is ironic because for a large number of patients with ards it is the treatment rather the syndrome which ends up killing them
4414448 now we apply tidal volumes normalized per ideal body weight of six to eight ml kg down from 12 to 15
4414449 the consequences are of course potentially more dangerous in patients in which the chest wall elastance is more compromised and the lung volume is more reduced
4414450 the immediate clinical implications are that clinicians should not trust the conventional measurements
4414451 if we could decrease with more refined measurements the mortality rate due to mechanical ventilation by 4 5 percent this could save up to 7500 lives in the u s if we accept that ali ards has an incidence of 150000 year
4414452 we wanted to investigate what was behind the observed sex differences in asthma rates and ar
4414453 this is the first study to prospectively examine the natural history of sex differences in asthma in this manner
4414454 while our results were not unexpected they do point to intriguing potential mechanisms to explain the gender differences in asthma incidence and severity especially intriguing is that the differences in gender begin at the time of transition into early puberty
4414455 it will be of great interest to follow these children over time to see what happens with ar and severity of asthma in adulthood
4414456 we are now able to perform a secondary analysis with an emphasis on those who have reached clinical normalcy
4414457 pharmacotherapy with salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate or the components reduces the rate of decline on fev1 in patients with moderate to severe copd thus slowing disease progression
4414458 to date smoking cessation is the only intervention that has conclusively been shown to alter the rate of decline in fev1
4414459 the rate of decline in fev1 was slowest in patients on sfc and fastest in those randomized to the placebo arm
4414460 from week 24 onward the adjusted rate of decline in fev1 was 39ml year for sfc 42 ml year for both sal and fp and 55 ml year for placebo
4414461 although treatment did not abolish the accelerated decline in lung function that occurs with copd it did ameliorate it substantially
4414462 the mechanism responsible for the effect on rate of decline is not clear as all treatments have potentially significant nonbronchodilator effects
4414463 the torch study brings some clarity to the treatment picture and provides some hopeful signs for patients with copd
4414464 this study also demonstrates that no treatment placebo is not an option for patients with moderate to severe copd

4414500 we chart the loafs every practice and hustle plays too its something tangible a way of showing the players whats acceptable and what isnt
4414501 he told me do you want to block a punt or do you want to talk about blocking a punt
4414502 for each loaf we run a pursuit drill its where the defense lines up in formation and the ball is put into play every player has to run all out in pursuit of the ball tagging the ball or taking a good pursuit angle toward it if the player doesnt reach the ball in time
4414503 i learned so much from him and appreciate all he did for me
4414504 im not going to out scheme anyone its not about that its all about passion and intensity i think any defense can use more of that and i think i can inject that into this defense
4414505 losing jack ikegwuonu early to the nfl hurts we need to see if corners aaron henry are ready to go after knee injuries theres no doubt it will be the cornerbacks who dictate how we can play defense this year
4414506 the thing that strikes me about dave is how detail oriented he is
4414507 hes an extremely smart coach and he really seems to bond well with players they like him and play hard for him
4414508 when he would make hand outs for the players they always were meticulous and well done he never left anything for chance and wanted to make sure everyone knew what they were supposed to be doing
4414509 there was a time in the game when a usc defensive player was chasing an illinois guy and ran up behind him and punched the ball out we try to show our guys film like that which emphasizes the things we teach and preach on the practice field
4414510 its all about figuring out what happened and why it happened and its my job to get them to play hard
4414511 but understand this that in the last days there will come times of stress for men will be lovers of self lovers of money proud arrogant abusive holding the form of religion but denying the power of it the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own likings and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander into myths as for you always be steady endure suffering do the work of an evangelist fulfill your ministry

4414521 we have to see what she rice has to bring
4414522 whilst operators understandably dont want to be perceived as trying to unfairly glean excess revenues from unwitting subscribers while abroad taking a one size fits all approach blocking their usage while abroad will result in them losing very significant revenues at a time when you would expect them to be looking to maximise their 3g network investments
4414523 operators need to take better control of their network assets so that they can offer a bespoke service to each user on a case by case basis
4414524 in a competitive european market where operators are increasingly trying to differentiate their service and the many millions of corporate subscribers are becoming increasingly international operators surely have no choice but to ensure they maximise all mobile broadband revenue opportunities whilst offering subscribers the best possible service
4414525 this is surely an indictment on customer data standards at any organisation that sends transactional documents all of whom want to grasp the transpromo opportunity but a section of whom seem to be undermining that opportunity
4414526 if transpromo is to be effectively exploited there needs to be an improvement in customer data standards two fifths of the population have received bills or statements addressed to the wrong person in the last six months which could seriously undermine consumer attitudes to advertising carried in those documents the opportunities presented by transpromo are probably very considerable but their effective use requires british business to make significant enhancements to the way it manages and updates customer records
4414527 we are delighted with the popularity of fishtext and feedback so far indicates that users are extremely pleased with the service
4414528 fishtexts success demonstrates that traditional text messaging is an overpriced and underdeveloped service many users have expressed surprise that the fishtext mobile application delivers text messages all over the world so reliably for just a couple of pence while their own operator charges over ten times that amount with some not even providing delivery reports or charging extra for them

4414536 our results show that almost half of people questioned felt they had bought their endowment policy on a false promise this is not just a case of a small purchase this is thousands of pounds for a house that we are talking about
4414537 there are several reasons that somebody may have been mis sold an endowment policy including a lack of adequate explanation an endowment policy is not a short term commitment and this should have been made clear when the policy was bought as should the fees and risks involved

4414543 with over 40 years experience in information security and having worked closely with the information security forum it is clear that its role is more important than ever
4414544 information security is no longer just a technical challenge it is a business imperative and is or should be on the top of boardroom agendas in every corporation the isf is a unique organization that provides a confidential peer to peer forum for members across different countries sectors and disciplines and is able to draw on their diverse skills and expertise to distill best practice and deliver an unmatched portfolio of research methodologies and tools
4414545 it is a distinct privilege to be the first president of the isf and i look forward to working with the dedicated professionals that have brought the isf to the position it is today i will strive to help raise greater awareness of the information security challenges faced today from the increase in cybercrime to the growing burden of compliance companies need to adopt a risk management perspective and recognize that information security is business driven and not crisis driven
4414546 we are delighted that howard schmidt has accepted this important position at the isf
4414547 the value of the isf has always been born out of the people in the organization its members our expert consultants and the management team it is clear that howards unparalleled experience and knowledge will make a major contribution to the future of the isf and its members he will also be driving our ambitious plans to expand the scale and reach of the isf building on our existing membership from europe and scandinavia through the americas to the middle east india africa australia and the pacific rim

4414549 good email delivered to the inbox is welcomed but people hate spam and are equally frustrated when valid email is unnecessarily blocked however the picture has improved significantly in recent years today all the parties involved in email marketing recognise that they have to collaborate if the industry is to combat spam and ensure that the medium achieves its potential
4414550 a growing spirit of openness has seen isps become richer sources of information which in turn enables email marketers to respond by using the sophisticated capabilities of lyris listmanager 10 everyone wins because less spam is delivered and more legitimate messages get in to the inbox
4414551 ensuring that email messages make it to the inbox continues to be a critical challenge for email marketers particularly as spam volumes increase and internet service providers isps change their guidelines for which messages get delivered
4414552 the timing is right for this demonstration weve seen a massive increase of interest in targeted advertising and are already working with iptv broadcasters network owners and vendors not to mention advertising agencies and brands mobile tv is a vital part of the rapidly changing world of tv and is a vital part of our roadmap like packet vision udcast is a pioneer in its particular area of innovation with a proven track record and global reach so there is a natural synergy between the two companies
4414553 we expect targeted advertising to be an important element of mobile tv business models including free to air services where finding ways to generate revenue from advertising will be essential udcasts mobile tv solutions are compliant with majority of standards deployed across the world we are in an ideal position to provide the global platform for delivering mobile tv so it makes sense to work with packet vision which we believe is at the forefront of delivering targeted advertising technology on ip video networks

4414557 many 16 21 year olds now make the choice to go straight to work rather than university and as a result are very career driven we think it is important to recognise those who are just starting out in their working life and offer them support especially in the first stages of their professional lives when they are likely to be making important financial decisions

4414625 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4414649 im assuming that by message the presenter means a carefully crafted campaign of very limited information that flows only one way simply put the marketer tells the audience what he wants us to know and were supposed to be happy to get it our only response to the message should be to either buy the product or vote for the politician the message is telling us to bloggers dont play that game bloggers dig and digg deeper than the press releases or news articles theyve been handed bloggers say when they disagree with political or business decisions bloggers say what they think but more importantly blog readers get to say what they think as well a blogger posts commenters respond and many people are participating in a two way conversation

4414654 we have performed very well in recent friendlies they have been great attacking performances so it is not something that concerns me
4414655 we are aware there are only two weeks to go before the end of the window that is something we are working on constantly anyway
4414656 we work without rest to look for players and weve always known the deadline day is the august 31
4414657 we are working calming in the background on one or two things we prefer to work with as much discretion as we can
4414658 the consoles at certain periods are more powerful than the pc but the pc can improve its capacity and ability every year so the cycle changes generally the pc gaming business gets better over time in these console cycles so as we continue this cycle graphically the pcs will continue to get better and the features will become more interesting
4414659 so what do we do well its better not to invest a lot of money on that particular platform
4414660 we know that the developers that are creating the pc game are not going to get paid for the work they do and the games wont break even so we prefer to focus on platforms that maybe have less piracy and where more customers are actually paying for the content they consume
4414661 we greatly reduced the number of people working on pc games because of that
4414662 the pc gaming community is very often against any kind of system that prohibits piracy which i have difficulty understanding they need to help us to make sure we can invest on the pc because if we cant get a return on investment with pc games then we will not invest
4414663 a system that will make sure you have a better experience when you buy than game rather than when you dont buy it

4414735 certainly it will bring changes in indian football because it is the first time in 24 years that we have qualified for the afc asian cup i think with this more sponsors will come in and more and more people will start following indian football this is the much needed boost to the indian football
4414736 results or no results people should follow because we play for the country i am not saying only for football but all sports including cricket because we put 120 per cent on the field hence we need honest support from the people this will help us put up a good show ahead

4414748 wahai orang orang yang beriman bertakwalah kepada allah dengan sebenar benar takwa kepada nya dan janganlah kamu mati kecuali dalam keadaan muslim ali imran 102
4414749 wahai manusia bertakwalah kepada rabb mu yang telah menciptakan kamu dari diri yang satu adam dan allah menciptakan pasangannya hawa dari diri nya dan dari keduanya allah memperkembang biakkan laki laki dan perempuan yang banyak bertakwalah kepada allah yang dengan nama nya kamu saling meminta dan peliharalah hubungan kekeluargaan sesungguhnya allah selalu menjaga dan mengawasimu
4414750 wahai orang orang yang beriman bertakwalah kamu kepada allah dan ucapkanlah perkataan yang benar niscaya allah akan memperbaiki amal amalmu dan mengampuni dosa dosamu dan barangsiapa mentaati allah dan rasul nya maka sungguh ia menang dengan kemenangan yang besar
4414751 karena itu ingatlah kamu kepada ku niscaya aku ingat pula kepadamu dan bersyukurlah kepada ku dan janganlah kamu mengingkari nikmat ku
4414752 dan jika kamu menghitung nikmat nikmat allah niscaya kamu tidak akan dapat menghitungnya sesungguhnya manusia sangat zhalim dan sangat mengingkari nikmat allah
4414753 dua nikmat yang banyak manusia tertipu dengan keduanya yaitu nikmat sehat dan waktu luang
4414754 dia lah yang mengutus rasul nya dengan membawa petunjuk dan agama yang hak agar dimenangkan nya terhadap semua agama dan cukuplah allah sebagai saksi
4414755 barangsiapa yang melapangkan satu kesusahan dunia dari seorang mukmin maka allah melapangkan darinya satu kesusahan di hari kiamat barangsiapa memudahkan urusan atas orang yang kesulitan dalam masalah hutang maka allah memudahkan atasnya di dunia dan akhirat barangsiapa menutupi aib seorang muslim maka allah menutupi aib nya di dunia dan akhirat allah senantiasa menolong hamba selama hamba tersebut senantiasa menolong saudaranya barangsiapa yang meniti suatu jalan untuk mencari ilmu maka allah memudahkan untuknya jalan menuju surga tidaklah suatu kaum berkumpul di salah satu rumah allah masjid untuk membaca kitabullah dan mempelajarinya di antara mereka melainkan ketenteraman turun atas mereka rahmat meliputi mereka malaikat mengelilingi mereka dan allah menyanjung mereka di tengah para malaikat yang berada di sisi nya barangsiapa yang lambat amalnya maka tidak dapat dikejar dengan nasabnya
4414756 barangsiapa yang berjalan menuntut ilmu maka allah mudahkan jalannya menuju surga
4414757 dan hendaklah kamu tetap di rumahmu dan janganlah kamu berhias dan bertingkah laku seperti orang orang jahiliyyah dahulu dan laksanakanlah shalat tunaikanlah zakat taatilah allah dan rasul nya sesungguhnya allah bermaksud hendak menghilangkan dosa dari kamu wahai ahlul bait dan membersihkan kamu dengan sebersih bersihnya dan ingatlah apa yang dibacakan di rumahmu dari ayat ayat allah dan al hikmah sunnah nabimu sungguh allah mahalembut maha menge tahui

4414764 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4414765 made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else
4414766 and then she forgave me and we went to work on it
4414767 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4414768 hes just to be very frank with just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4414769 the bottom line to it is john edwards and elizabeth edwards had no knowledge of anything i did

4414773 im still fighting for that medal count with him he has four so i have a few more to go
4414774 its an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him there on the floor exactly 20 years after he competed
4414775 i honestly didnt know until she finished and the scores came up
4414776 but because of his great love for us god who is rich in mercy made us alive with christ even when we were dead in transgressions it is by grace you have been saved and god raised us up with christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in christ jesus in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace expressed in his kindness to us in christ jesus

4414778 at arms length from ministers to ensure the independence and objectivity of the testing regime
4414779 ets europe was selected due to the strength of their worldwide experience in delivering large scale assessments
4414780 it is disappointing that the issues with this years national curriculum test results have meant that the partnership between qca and ets europe must end early
4414781 ets europe has apologised to schools for the delays in marking national curriculum assessments in england
4414782 as a subsidiary of a global non profit company we are dedicated to assuring quality and equity for all pupils and we are sorry that the results this summer were delayed for some schools
4414783 my department has sought to ensure that due process has been followed throughout that the public purse is protected
4414784 ets had a long history of international failure before they were signed up by this government to run sats tests ministers bear direct responsibility for signing up with a firm that let down children and teachers so badly
4414785 it is simply not possible for the qca to appoint a new test contractor to deliver the sats exams for 2009
4414786 the government needs to take this golden opportunity to completely overhaul its testing regime and in the interim should suspend sats for 2009
4414787 given the high stakes nature of testing schools teachers parents and presumably the government will want to ensure that the inquiry examines fully the implications of arms length private companies being charged with such onerous responsibilities

4415005 although governments may not yet be able to manage the weather they can improve the management of floodplains to reduce damages caused by flooding
4415006 rather than spend national tax dollars on flood control structures and post diaster aid the federal government should provide continuously updated information about changing flood risks and land uses across whole watersheds

4415034 as long as a side of the house makes a point whether valid or not and the other side of the house fails to disprove it so points can be awarded for doing so
4415035 this is an absolute disgrace to the profession of adjudication i will prove this later

4415042 the idea is to feed the indigent but as such there is no screening
4415043 everyone is feeling the economic crunch and if they can get even one meal for free why not
4415044 i dont want people committing suicide or killing their children due to hunger the idea is to rekindle the spirit of giving among our people
4415045 the signs are already there increased number of suicides due to poverty unemployment and despair lawlessness people killing their own children as they cannot feed them im not exaggerating
4415046 history has seen that happen over and over again in different parts of the world and for the same reasons hunger is a very real and agonising form of violence sooner or later people will react i hope it wont come to that but the callousness greed and cold bloodedness of so many of our decision makers confounds the imagination
4415047 the nation at a collective level should come forward and pitch in in these times when artificial food fuel and economic crises are being created globally societies need to come together to prevent a social and moral meltdown
4415048 you cannot do much about commodity price spirals in world markets inflation is a natural and necessary process through which rising world prices are reflected in the domestic economy
4415049 keep a close watch on particular sectors notably basic kitchen items to ensure that domestic price spirals and shortages do not develop protect the most vulnerable through targeted subsidies or untargeted but limited rations and secure greater foreign inflows this will relieve pressure on the external account and allow the rupee to become a little stable thus reducing some of the effects of imported inflation

4415107 markets believe that much of the fall in sterling reflects a possibly temporary increase in the sterling risk premium
4415108 it is true to say that in the area of liquidity we probably have moved to a better situation
4415109 you can see from the measures that central banks have taken around the world that liquidity issues have certainly improved
4415110 attention is now turning away from liquidity and more towards questions of funding and viability of an institutions business plan
4415111 we dont guarantee lending to other forms of borrowing we dont guarantee lending to manufacturing borrowing there is no reason why in the long run you need to have any guarantee of lending to the mortgage market
4415112 it would be very dangerous to move to a situation where the government saw its major role as guaranteeing lending why should the taxpayer take on the risk for borrowing by individual borrowers some of whom are risky its the lenders who should take the risk and assess for themselves the riskiness of that lending

4415114 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defense system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4415115 i consider that the united states is not acting in a cautious manner in this situation
4415116 instead of getting full moral and political support in the struggle against real aggression and ethnic cleansing we have heard a mass of unpleasant words and threats that will of course not strengthen our relations

4415119 i had the choice of rangers and celtic and it was a hard decision to make
4415120 but the chance to play in the champions league was what swung it for me
4415121 i was flattered by rangers interest but the chance to play in europe was just too good to turn down
4415122 im delighted to be joining a club like celtic they are a big club and it will be a dream to play for them
4415123 jeromes a young player that harry has always liked a quick wide player who is a good addition to the squad
4415124 the idea is that he comes here and proves himself if he plays to the ability we all know he has then he has a great chance of staying here longer so its in his hands
4415125 the british market is incredibly difficult to work in because the fees for players and their wages are so excessive we are hoping to bring in a couple of players in time for saturday we know we have to add more quality to the squad and we are working very very hard to do that
4415126 a lot of players enjoy being around the bigger clubs even if they arent in the team they enjoy the kudos and everything else that goes with it and dont fancy a battle at a club like stoke that is why we have to be very careful in attracting the right players and the right characters
4415127 i saw this goalkeeper against rangers twice and i think he is a talented goalkeeper and i am delighted to have signed him
4415128 we are searching for a goalkeeper and he was one of our candidates i think this goalkeeper has the quality to grow into the team
4415129 we now have the goalkeeper david obua and mike tullberg and our focus must be on always bringing in quality all three players have quality
4415130 we have to realise that while its good to play nice football there are times when you need to be dirty to win a game we have learned a lot recently one of the lessons is that sometimes you have to be tough when you are on the pitch that is part of football we dont have to be beautiful all the time

4415139 the haymarket location is both a vital artery to the city and a critical part of the edinburgh tram project
4415140 with this in mind we have developed a robust traffic management system to minimise congestion to ensure the continued movement of lothian buses and other bus services and ensure the safety of pedestrians

4415160 a lot of stigma is associated with the moral aspect of homosexuality
4415161 the vast majority of msm believe you cannot contract stis sexually transmitted infections from anal sex in nigeria we dont talk about anal sex and all the aids interventions are targeted at heterosexuals and vaginal sex the perception of gay people not using condoms is not because we dont want to but because we are not well informed
4415162 very few relationships are formed most of it is about the sex or the benefits
4415163 the majority of passive recipient gay men have accepted their sexuality

4415203 personally i want to keep improving be successful and win more things
4415204 hopefully that will drive us on to more success this season it is harder in the sense that all the other teams have improved and are getting better
4415205 weve been champions two years on the spin and are even more of a scalp so teams are really up for it we managed to overcome that challenge last season and that success drives you on
4415206 i think we will improve this season as well as other teams and its who can do it over the course of a season
4415207 weve managed to do it the past couple of years and its the test to do it again
4415208 the big clubs are always going to be in there towards the end of the season and it is really tough
4415209 those type of things are won and lost on really small things as we saw in the final last year so you need that bit of luck
4415210 weve shown we can do it once so we will try to do it again if we were to do it again this season two years in a row it would be absolutely incredible but weve got to perform and see how far it takes us

4415242 to reach that goal we have a lot of work to do at home we have to overcome each of the challenges i have spoken about we have to forge a greater unity of purpose between various political parties between different communities between all sections of our society rich and poor we have to manage our natural and financial resources more prudently we have an obligation to our future generations we cannot think only for ourselves we cannot think only about survival from day to day from year to year and from one election to another we have to think about the welfare and well being of our children and grandchildren their grandchildren and future generations

4415245 at a certain battle during 1917 two soldiers with compound fractures of the femur and large flesh wounds of the abdomen and scrotum were brought into the hospital these men had been wounded during an engagement and in such a part of the country hidden by brush that when the wounded of that battle were picked up they were overlooked for seven days they lay on the battlefield without water without food and exposed to the weather and all the insects which were about that region on their arrival at the hospital their condition was remarkably good and if it had not been for their starvation and thirst we would have said they were in excellent condition
4415246 at that time the mortality of compound fractures of the femur was about seventy five to eighty per cent
4415247 on removing the clothing from t he wounded part much was my surprise to see the wound filled with thousands and thousands of maggots apparently those of the blow fly these maggots simply swarmed and filled the entire wounded area the sight was very disgusting and measures were taken hurriedly to wash out these abominable looking creatures
4415248 the most remarkable picture was presented in the character of the wound which was exposed instead of having a wound filled with pus as one would have expected due to the degeneration of devitalized tissue and to the presence of the numerous types of bacteria these wounds were filled with the most beautiful pink granulation tissue that one could imagine there was practically no bare bone to be seen and the internal structure of the wounded bone as well as the surrounding parts was entirely covered with the pink rosy granulation tissue which filled the wound bacterial cultures were made and while one found a few staphylococci and streptococci still remaining they were very few in number and not sufficient at that time to cause a pus formation
4415249 1 maggots have been found to be a tremendously useful adjunct to thorough surgical treatment of chronic osteomyelitis and in our opinion are far more successful in securing permanent healing of these extensive wounds than any other method tried by us
4415250 2 maggots by their digestive action clear away the minute fragments of bone and tissue sloughs caused by operative trauma in a way not accomplished by any other means this is a tremendously valuable asset in the healing of a wound
4415251 3 maggots cause wounds to become alkaline and in this way diminish growth of pathogenic bacteria
4415252 4 maggots seem to have other more subtle biochemical effects within the wound itself and perhaps cause also a constitutional reaction inimical to bacterial growth this is under investigation
4415253 5 maggots as raised and sterilized in the manner described may be used in any wound without risk to the patient
4415254 6 the post traumatic or postoperative general condition of the patient is better in maggot treatment than in the older forms of treatment where infection was combatted by chemicals or other types of dressing there is less absorption and less toxic reaction
4415255 7 in open tuberculous abscesses with or without secondary infection wide exposure followed by maggot treatment has proved surprisingly effective in a small number of cases and will be given further trial

4415261 the united states government then will turn to questions of both economic reconstruction and also what to do to help the georgian security forces looking to the longer term future
4415262 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west economically and politically and in security arrangements
4415263 i think that the russians further message was to all of the parts of the former soviet union as a signal about trying to integrate with the west and move outside of the longtime russian sphere of influence
4415264 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
4415265 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia

4415275 it is possible that a licensing regime could help mitigate the impact of harmful interference to incumbents in this spectrum

4415281 the coordinator of kidney transplantation at hadassah university hospital in jerusalem as saying that 60 of the 244 patients currently receiving post transplant care purchased their new kidney from a stranger just short of 25 percent of the patients at one of israels largest medical centers participating in the organ business
4415282 in the middle east residents of the gulf states kuwait saudi arabia and oman have for many years traveled to india the philippines and to eastern europe to purchase kidneys made scarce locally due to local fundamentalist islamic teachings that allow organ transplantation to save a life but prohibit organ harvesting from brain dead bodies meanwhile hundreds of kidney patients from israel which has its own well developed but under used transplantation centers due to ultra orthodox jewish reservations about brain death travel in transplant tourist junkets to turkey moldova romania where desperate kidney sellers can be found and to russia where an excess of lucrative cadaveric organs are produced due to lax standards for designating brain death and to south africa where the amenities in transplantation clinics in private hospitals can resemble four star hotels we found in many countries from brazil and argentina to india russia romania turkey to south africa and parts of the united states a kind of apartheid medicine that divides the world into two distinctly different populations of organs supplies and organs receivers
4415283 in general the movement and flow of living donor organs mostly kidneys is from south to north from poor to rich from black and brown to white and from female to male bodies

4415287 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4415288 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4415289 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4415290 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4415291 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4415292 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4415293 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4415294 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4415295 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4415296 who are open to doing something on the production side
4415297 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4415298 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4415299 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4415300 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4415301 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4415302 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4415303 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4415304 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4415305 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4415306 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4415307 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4415308 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4415309 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4415310 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4415311 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4415312 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4415313 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4415314 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4415315 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4415316 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4415317 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4415318 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4415319 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4415320 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4415321 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4415322 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4415323 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4415324 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4415325 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4415326 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4415327 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4415328 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4415329 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4415330 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4415331 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4415332 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4415333 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4415334 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4415335 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

4415353 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4415354 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4415355 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4415356 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4415357 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4415358 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4415359 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4415360 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4415361 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4415362 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4415363 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4415364 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4415365 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4415366 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4415367 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4415368 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4415369 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4415370 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4415371 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4415372 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4415373 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4415374 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4415375 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4415376 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4415377 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4415378 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4415379 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4415380 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4415381 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4415382 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

4415384 our political and military cooperation moves to a different higher level
4415385 i came extremely close to doing something very foolish at the zhan huan opening at pacewildenstein last night the installation was a giant concrete slab 7ft in height and aprx 50ft x 30ft to view the piece there were stairs that were set up over the structure so that the crowd could look down onto the top surface of the slab it was a conveyor line of people there was a wait and they checked all bags very hyped up on the surface 50ftx 30ft was a drawing done with ashes of a field of people chinese this work was executed by using many artists and was taken from a photograph there was an artist working on scaffolding while the show was going on i came so close to jumping up onto the piece and running to the center laying down and making an angel in the ash think about it asian anglo interactive the eastern field of people dwarfed by a western angel many artists and many hours funding altered in 30 seconds by one individual this is performance art in the raw w risk i scare myself because this was not just a fleeting thought andrew i came so close that in a sense it happened my partner and i discussed bail ect all in under a minute i hesitated they shuffled us through and the moment was ripped away my thought is that i will have other opportunities when i am established this way it will not be viewed as a publicity stunt and more importantly i will have proper bail money and good representation
4415386 i think its a little sweeter knowing ive been through some injuries and some doubters
4415387 but honestly i think it just made me so much stronger and made me the person i am today its been a long journey but every single moment has been worth it
4415388 she has a tiger inside her she was very strong today
4415389 i knew i really didnt have much of a chance to catch liukin
4415390 at that point i didn t really care where i placed i just wanted to finish my olympic experience with the best routine i could i wanted to represent the united states
4415391 i wasnt thinking about whether i was going to make it or not
4415392 i was thinking about how i was going to make it thats something that my dad has always taught me go in being so confident that you know youre going to make it and then just do the little corrections as you go
4415393 a drunk woman is not a master of her pussy
4415394 we have to get him ready to go to jesus
4415395 there are no excuses for this to happen to any baby
4415396 this is murder he had no reason to die he died because he cried
4415397 i mean not only did crystal and craig lose a son but crystal lost a husband and craigs parents lost a son and a grandson one day this was a happy perfect family and the next day its been devastated
4415398 maybe they both could have used a meeting that night
4415399 like two telephone poles with the lines between them cut
4415400 they pulled together they prayed together they took baby camryn off life support together
4415401 and that was a wonderful thing that they were able to pull together like that despite craig being alleged to have done these things
4415402 i dont care what craigs family members think he did this to my son may he get what he deserves maybe people should talk more about camryn than craig craigs name has no worth to even be mentioned
4415403 the question becomes if that autopsy is accurate if this child has been severely injured to the point that his ribs were fractured on prior occasions multiple occasions how come no one knew that
4415404 he only made the confession after the detectives involved started talking about other possibilities of how this child could have been injured what other folks in the household could have injured him then craig quickly took responsibility
4415405 no matter what happens craig is going to very likely spend the majority of his adult life in prison
4415406 if thats the breadwinner or the main breadwinner then youve got some serious financial problems right off the bat
4415407 i lost my job because of this because i couldnt work enough hours now i have to move into a smaller place
4415408 it will be the basis for divorces itll be the basis for the kind of family conflict that then brings into play maternal and paternal grandparents and the extended family on both sides and we end up with a lot of conflict
4415409 i cant have hate eat me up and beat me down i cant live like that
4415410 i will have to one day forgive him so that i might find peace
4415411 a drunk woman is not a master of her pussy
4415412 i think its imperative that the following step be taken
4415413 t he banking problems in the united states continue to mount while the federal governments deficit continues to soar out of control
4415414 when central banks intervene in the currency markets they exchange their currency for dollars
4415415 theres a crisis in the white house and to save the election theyd have to fake a war
4415416 washingtons bloody fingerprints are all over the invasion of south ossetia
4415417 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4415418 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4415419 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4415420 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4415421 the latest results are very disappointing if traders are selling alcohol to kids there is a knock on effect of anti social behaviour and criminal damage offences both in and around the shop
4415422 the vast majority of traders in north east lincolnshire are responsible i dont want to tar everyone with the same brush
4415423 but the ones who repeatedly sell alcohol to youngsters are liable to lose their licences completely
4415424 the number of failures was higher than in recent times which shows too many shopkeepers are still prepared to snub the law in favour of a quick profit
4415425 we will not hesitate to take action against any retailers found selling alcohol to underage youngsters given the well documented information about how such items can cause serious health and anti social problems which impact across the whole community
4415426 our message to traders is that they cant be vigilant one day and have an off day the next where they take their eye off the law
4415427 if unsure they must ask for id and refuse sales if they have any concerns at all
4415428 trading standards officers can offer advice and education but retailers have a great responsibility to ensure the law is upheld

4415434 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4415435 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4415436 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4415437 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4415439 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4415440 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4415441 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4415442 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4415443 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4415444 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4415445 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4415446 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4415447 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry

4415458 additionally it is easy to use and this is the reason why an increasing number of bodyshops switches over to waterborne basecoats

4415532 we have to realise that while its good to play nice football there are times when you need to be dirty to win a game we have learned a lot recently one of the lessons is that sometimes you have to be tough when you are on the pitch that is part of football we dont have to be beautiful all the time

4415579 is using his decree powers to enact a set of socialist inspired measures that seem based on a package of constitutional changes
4415580 when the government acts as it has now without respecting the constitution and the word of the president is the law then an act of tyranny is being committed
4415581 formalize socialist inspired policies on the margins of the formal economy like a measure declaring barter a legitimate system of payment
4415582 the coming regional elections have the potential to erode the presidents power base

4415584 chavez enact ing aggressive new laws with an iron fist increasing the states power over the economy ahead of key regional elections

4415587 typical of mr chavezs authoritarian streak and will let him expropriate private property without the need for the ans approval

4415591 we are in the presence of a dictatorial government which has given a coup detat to the constitution here we have no constitution no law and the president does exactly what he wants
4415592 everything hes doing is related to the upcoming election and its hard to imagine he doesnt see this as important in his efforts to keep power

4415639 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4415640 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4415641 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4415642 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4415643 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view

4415645 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4415646 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4415647 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4415648 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4415649 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4415650 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4415651 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4415652 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4415653 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4415654 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4415655 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4415656 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4415657 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4415658 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4415659 bridges to nowhere than the one in alaska and there are more builders of such bridges than those built by alaskas defendant senator
4415660 republican presidential candidate john mccain now enjoys a healthy 88 7 percent lead over barack obama among republicans
4415661 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4415662 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4415663 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4415664 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4415665 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4415666 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4415667 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4415668 ive lent my crystal ball to someone so i cant give you the figure
4415669 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4415670 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4415671 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4415672 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4415673 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4415674 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
4415675 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
4415676 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
4415677 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment

4415679 obama does better against mccain with hunters and especially fisherpeople than did his two democratic predecessors vis a vis bush
4415680 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4415681 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4415682 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4415683 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4415684 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4415685 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4415686 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4415687 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4415688 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4415689 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4415690 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4415691 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4415692 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4415693 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4415694 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4415695 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4415696 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4415697 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4415698 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4415699 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4415700 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4415701 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4415702 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4415703 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4415704 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4415705 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4415706 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4415707 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
4415708 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate
4415709 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4415710 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4415711 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4415712 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4415713 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4415714 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4415715 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4415716 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4415717 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4415718 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4415719 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4415720 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4415721 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4415722 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4415723 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4415724 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4415725 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4415726 our estimate was to cover at most one million people but we ended up having to contend with another one million people that we did not budget for
4415727 it is observed that majority of the citizenry virtually do nothing politically until the next round of election and campaigns come up in another four years
4415728 directly violates the human rights of the victims as laid out in articles 14 1 2 and 15 1 2 of the 1992 constitution
4415729 a trotro driver and mate who pulled over at the military hospital to allow an ambulance to pass were arrested by two men dressed in military uniforms and led them into the hospital where they were detained and made to pay three ghana cedis but were not released
4415730 the mate was told to stare at the corpse for an hour and was locked in and left alone in the room with the corpse for that length of time
4415731 they were told to touch the breast of a female corpse which they did they were then told to kiss the dead woman but they refused the soldier touched both the driver and mate on their genitals
4415732 the solder then ordered them to hold a dead child which they both refused to do they were then asked to wash the floor which they did they were then taken into another room where they stood watching the dressing of dead bodies for 15 minutes they were then asked to pay some money which they did not
4415733 for inefficiency suspicion and underestimating the number of eligible voters during the exercise
4415734 there is the need for proper planning by the electoral commission so that the nasty incident we just witnessed during the exercise will be a thing of the past
4415735 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4415736 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4415737 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4415738 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4415739 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4415740 just so you all know we did set a record
4415741 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4415742 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4415743 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4415744 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4415745 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4415746 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4415747 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4415748 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4415749 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4415750 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4415751 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4415752 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4415753 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4415754 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4415755 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4415756 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4415757 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4415758 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4415759 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4415760 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4415761 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4415762 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
4415763 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
4415764 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
4415765 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4415766 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4415767 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4415768 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4415769 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
4415770 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4415771 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4415772 for climate changes he glosses over that this local planetary system is in constant change and we cant accurately measure the recent relatively small changes and anthropogenic contributions are an open question
4415773 how would the developers in this audience feel if the news media were opining on the benefits of one programming language over another and other people with no knowledge of programming were making strong statements based on what theyd read or heard in the media
4415774 im curious robert whether you are also skeptical about evolution that would be a good litmus test of whether this is a political religious disagreement or a scientific one
4415775 right now your choices are between the scientists who are actually conducting the research and analysis and pundits who are opining on something that they have no data research or proper science to support
4415776 most scientists think that global warming is an issue i think its bunk
4415777 there no agreement among scientists that weather patterns are changing as a result of human activity
4415778 look they are saying there may be the equivalent of war crimes trials one day
4415779 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4415780 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4415781 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4415782 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4415783 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4415784 i may just be a small drop in this vast universe but to my loved ones i am their universe
4415785 whether you think you can or you cant big pause here youre right
4415786 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4415787 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4415788 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4415789 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4415790 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4415791 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4415792 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4415793 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4415794 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4415795 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4415796 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4415797 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4415798 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4415799 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4415800 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4415801 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
4415802 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
4415803 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
4415804 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
4415805 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
4415806 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
4415807 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
4415808 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4415809 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4415810 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4415811 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4415812 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4415813 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4415814 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4415815 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4415816 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4415817 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4415818 at least al gore may have something to be happy about
4415819 vi riktar ocks v ra insatser mot ungdomar och alkohol
4415820 it is important that every teenager should set a goal because it determines their future
4415821 teen is a very important age group because it merges childhood to adulthood everyone wants to live a wonderful life when they grow up but this will be possible if you set a goal and work towards it life may be hard but you need to believe in yourself
4415822 i thank god for the talent he has given me and i want the youths of fiji to make good use of their talent and use it to praise god
4415823 i love this song and i love the lyrics as it always inspires me to stay strong in my faith and also the song suited my voice well
4415824 as for the money i won tonight i will have to give my tithe in church and share the rest with my family who has greatly supported me throughout
4415825 i feel really great tonight and i thank my family and loved ones who have been supporting me this money will be off my hands tonight because it will all go to my parents and they can decide what they give to me
4415826 the drive on the left is a likely freeagent desktop replacement while the drive on the right looks to either augment or replace the freeagent go series with its thinner profile and docking port
4415827 new versions itunes and the iphone software could theoretically eliminate this problem by syncing only the metadata or tiny files containing the barebones attributes of each media item or playlist but not the content itself from a users itunes library to their portable devices
4415828 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4415829 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4415830 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4415831 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4415832 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4415833 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4415834 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4415835 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4415836 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4415837 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4415838 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4415839 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4415840 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4415841 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4415842 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4415843 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4415844 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4415845 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4415846 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4415847 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4415848 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4415849 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4415850 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4415851 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4415852 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4415853 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4415854 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4415855 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4415856 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4415857 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4415858 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4415859 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4415860 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4415861 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4415862 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4415863 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4415864 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4415865 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4415866 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4415867 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4415868 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4415869 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
4415870 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4415871 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4415872 you have the most beautiful breasts i have ever seen
4415873 m ost of america understands that the competence bar is set so low for gov george w bush of texas that its practically lying on the ground
4415874 doesnt seem to realize that in the real world people hate eddie haskell
4415875 for every complex problem there is a solution that is simple neat and wrong
4415876 de facto slogan has become real men dont think things through
4415877 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
4415878 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4415879 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4415880 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4415881 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4415882 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
4415883 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
4415884 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
4415885 branchen f r det sv rt i den kommende tid og wdh vil v re presset som f lge af et spinkelt produkt lineup for resten af 2008
4415886 vi ved ikke mere end der stod i pressemeddelelsen fra stones den telefonbesked jeg modtog om det sagde mindre end pressemeddelelsen nu er vi g et i gang med at ndre aftaler og forl nge lejem l hvilket netop lige er lykkedes s retten ogs fremover kan fungere nu er det bare at afvente
4415887 vi er i allerh jeste grad utilfredse vi har fors gt at tale til de p g ldende parter men kan ikke g re noget det virkede ellers til at vi havde en udm rket kontakt til stones som vi har haft m der med men nu har de valgt at tr kke sig det overrasker os for mit indtryk var at de var ret langt med en redning
4415888 jeg kan ikke gennemskue hvor ansvaret ligger vi har intet skriftligt set og kender ikke deres indbyrdes aftaler s det er umuligt at sige noget om det p nuv rende tidspunkt men noget tyder p at en ret kommer til at tage stilling til det
4415889 jeg frygter at der p begynder et langvarigt forl b da de to parter ikke kan blive enige om hvem der har ansvaret for at f keops til at fungere igen vi kan risikere at det tager meget lang tid
4415890 we had many interviews with asafa over the last few years as he prepares for the games
4415891 these give him a little boost of inspiration as he steps up to the line
4415892 melihat koi itu seperti melihat keindahan lukisan warnanya yang cerah dengan kombinasi merah putih dan hitam kadang kadang juga ada yang kuning membuat mata segar apalagi melihat liukan koi yang bak peragawati sangat indah sekali
4415893 begitu melihat koi saya langsung jatuh cinta apalagi ketika saya baca dari literatur koi itu sangat global dan organisasinya sudah sangat bagus tercipta di dunia banyak negara yang juga senang koi semuanya berpusat ke jepang karena memang jepang yang memiliki peternakan koi paling tua dan bagus
4415894 makanya setiap pencinta koi biasanya memiliki genset jadi biar listrik mati ikan tetap mendapat pasokan oksigen biar deh rumah gelap asalkan koi tetap dapat oksigen
4415895 dulu pertama kali saya terjun di koi istri saya protes sudah satu minggu bekerja di kantor kok sabtu minggu masih sibuk juga dengan koi setelah dia saya ajak ternyata bukan saya saja yang membawa istri teman teman lain juga banyak membawa istri lalu mereka akhirnya berteman semua sejak itu istri saya ini juga senang pada koi
4415896 kami memang tidak menernakkan ikan koi dari jepang kualitas anak yang dihasilkan di sini tentu berbeda dengan anak ikan yang dihasilkan di jepang jepang memiliki teknologi dan mekanisme yang bagus sehingga anakan yang dihasilkan sangat berkualitas
4415897 koi lokal sebenarnya tidak kalah bagus untuk ukuran di bawah 40 cm koi lokal beberapa kali menyabet grand champion memang untuk ukuran di atas 40 cm koi lokal tidak bisa bersaing warnanya tidak sebagus koi impor
4415898 banyak peternak koi atau pedagang koi putus asa karena ikannya dicuri orang atau karyawannya sendiri
4415899 ada beberapa petani yang hanya melihat keuntungan di saat sekarang mereka tidak melihat keuntungan di masa depan contohnya indukan yang kami berikan untuk meningkatkan kualitas koi lokal ternyata dijual lalu anakan yang tidak bagus tidak musnahkan melainkan dijual dengan harga murah jika anakan berkualitas buruk dibiarkan hidup akan menyebabkan perawatan koi tidak fokus makanan yang harusnya hanya untuk koi bagus juga harus diberikan ke koi jelek ini tentu saja meningkatkan biaya
4415900 penyakit koi yang paling ganas adalah herpes jika satu ikan terkena herpes maka seluruh ikan di kolam itu harus dimusnahkan karena dia telah membawa virus itu kolamnya juga harus dibersihkan tetapi banyak juga orang yang merasa sayang lalu hanya memusnahkan koi yang sakit saja
4415901 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4415902 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
4415903 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
4415904 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
4415905 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4415906 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
4415907 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
4415908 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously

4415920 the support from family and friends has been brilliant i really did try my best there is such a fine line between winning and losing after i have had a little reflect on what i have done i did good at first i was a bit negative but i am proud of myself
4415921 i have got to make some big decisions about 2012 the london olympics i am 95 per cent sure that i will be going for 2012
4415922 i am gutted i just didnt shoot at my best it was just a fine line hitting 10s and 8s
4415923 if she had been telling us to stop it would have stuck in my mind so obviously she didnt
4415924 probably have to go beyond a seven minute drive to fill it and draw business from neighbouring towns
4415925 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4415926 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4415927 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4415928 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
4415929 he is ready to resign but he is putting conditions like indemnity for the november 3 action

4415936 our message will not be silenced nor will our first amendment rights be abridged
4415937 we are excited to learn that the free speech rights of pro life students on campus have been restored
4415938 all the group wanted to do was educate fellow students about the horrors of abortion how can they do that when their speech gets restricted to low visibility areas of campus we are thankful to the alliance defense fund for coming to their aid

4415942 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
4415943 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
4415944 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
4415945 the national telecommunications and information administration an agency of the department of commerce is the show stopper here
4415946 theyre the only department of the government that isnt on board with securing the domain name system and unfortunately theyre also the ones who commerce deputized to oversee icann
4415947 the biggest difference is that once the root is signed and the public key is out it will be put in every operating system and will be on all cds from apple microsoft suse freebsd etc
4415948 the only one you have to have to go down the tree
4415949 a few years ago there were still technical hurdles to actually signing and using dnssec but in the past few years a lot of software tools both commercial and open source have come out and now its a completely solved problem
4415950 all thats left is the far less tractable purely political problem
4415951 arguing over who gets to hold the cryptographic keys in the long run should wait until were not facing a critical threat
4415952 we are committed to taking no action that would have the potential to adversely affect the operational stability of the dns
4415953 while there is increasing pressure to secure the dns ntia must work with all stakeholders and consider all possible solutions
4415954 currently dnssec is the only mechanism known to protect against the kaminsky attack
4415955 it is not clear that other solutions will provide the same level of protection as dnssec
4415956 then the issue becomes political because there seems to be the perception that the introduction of a key guardian changes the current policies
4415957 we would want to bring the editing creation and signing of the root zone file here

4415962 whenever you bump up performance by such a great level you open up the opportunities for apps people havent thought of yet
4415963 dont forget this is faster than ethernet so all of a sudden usb 3 becomes a very viable way to connect external drives that will be as fast if not faster than an internal
4415964 some notebooks werent living up to battery life and the only difference was one had a webcam which turned out to be a usb device internally that caused the usb ports to stay active and thus drain the battery
4415965 the information we are all giving to online companies is massive and dangerous and securitys going to get worse before it gets better
4415966 our belief is that with the right technology the new generation of cloud computing system can be made as secure if not more secure than existing server based office systems
4415967 abb robots incorporate energy efficient motors currently available in the market and also help to reduce lighting costs heating and enable companies to work over a period of 24 hours
4415968 some of the technologies developed today are only useful for 6 to 18 months and after that become outdated abb works on a more standardised product to ensure that longevity spare parts and sourcing components over a long period are not a problem
4415969 from the perspective of technology the most important aspect is that our customers can be assured that buying an abb robot will not lead to having to develop special interfacing protocols abb robotics uses standard interfacing protocols
4415970 within 24 hours of the plastic film being applied to a surface less than 1 bacterium out of 1 million bacteria will survive
4415971 it also reduces the environmental impact of the process and we have developed a method that is easy to apply and could bring great benefits to patients in hospitals as well as the food industry
4415972 this is an outstanding example of how chemical engineers are making a crucial contribution to society
4415973 that means you will also have less drug reaching the normal tissue
4415974 the results are actually highly dependent on the surface chemistry
4415975 in other words you dont get this result just by attaching drugs to any nanotubes
4415976 right now what we are doing is so called passive targeting which is using the leaky vasculature of the tumor
4415977 but a more active targeting would be attaching a peptide or antibody to the nanotube drug one that will bind more specifically to the tumor which should further enhance the treatment efficacy

4415987 this new technology is allowing us to image the sea floor in unprecedented detail and is providing valuable information about the huge scale and immense power of these giant submarine flows
4415988 we have found that giant landslides are actually quite rare around the canary islands with no major activity in the last 15 000 years
4415989 at the moment we dont even know where the lisbon quake originated

4416011 we did not wait for parliament to enact a law we used the powers vested in us to come up with the bylaw to boost education parliament has also helped us by passing a bill on universal primary education
4416012 we have tried our level best to attend the meetings of the joint committee and make our contribution whenever necessary to our disappointment the bill has become too over politicised
4416013 there is a parallel committee of state house presidential land bill task force doing the same work
4416014 what does all this mean for the future of our country
4416015 mallinga thinks that i want to contest against him i have information that he rang officers at mbale police station and ordered them to arrest me

4416019 there are still disagreements among members of the council on the measures to be taken on the staff as per the recommendations
4416020 the tribunal ruled in their favour however we have appealed to the high court and are awaiting its decision
4416021 besides a letter from the lc1 of that area states that the land was sold off by someone from masindi i am not aware what action is being taken to secure this land
4416022 people are right that is why they won the case this is big land that can resettle many people

4416024 our worry is that the disease might break out again because of the heavy rains pounding the region the district health team is still sensitising the communities on how to prevent the spread of the disease
4416025 recently we received two suspected cholera patients but the tests revealed that they were suffering from diarrhoea

4416072 the west has spent a lot of time energy and money to teach georgia the tricks of the trade to make the country look like a democracy

4416074 i lost my second baseman when the pitcher threw the ball at his head and i dont see any place for that in baseball johnson said
4416075 i respect the way cuba plays baseball but i dont like losing players or how that game ended lazo is a good pitcher but he hit him in the eye no game of baseball is worth that
4416076 that is a lack of respect on the part of the u
4416077 the cuban team is very professional we respect the game and our opponents we are incapable of doing that
4416078 im not the type of pitcher to do that because its not the correct way to play the game i did not hit him intentionally it was an accident the ball hit the bat first and bounced onto his face thats unfortunate but i was just pitching to get him out
4416079 we won partly because of the new rule but that doesnt mean im in favor of it pacheco said
4416080 i think it kills classic matches today it worked for us but other nights it will benefit others i would prefer to play the games out

4416084 the cubans have a very strong baseball tradition as does the united states so these games are always highly anticipated i predict these teams will meet again for the gold medal which is how it should be i only wish the u s sent its major leaguers so we could see the best of the best

4416087 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4416088 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4416089 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4416090 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4416091 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty
4416092 they were coming through security when one of the officers smelled that their breath was rather sweeter than it should be it was reported to the police
4416093 they went to board their aircraft which was being towed out of the hangar to go back to russia it had just had its undercarriage fixed they were breathalysed
4416094 you could see they werent right as they were waiting for the plane to be towed from the hangar they could not actually stand up on their own they were holding onto the side of the bus that had taken them to the hangar they were swaying thats why we got the police involved straight away
4416095 police at manchester airport arrested two men under suspicion of being under the influence of alcohol while acting as crew members
4416096 we woke up at 12 55 this morning to this almighty thundering noise we thought it was someone breaking in went downstairs and saw people outside it was total carnage the car had hit the kerb and ploughed into the fence taking out a concrete fence post and hitting the caravan
4416097 i told the fire brigade there were two gas bottles in the caravan so they doused everything down with water when they got into the car they turned round and said theyre both dead and everything slowed down at that point its a terrible way to go
4416098 i was speaking to two lads who were crossing the road seconds before they saw the car come screeching round the corner hit one kerb and then another lose control and then it must have blown a tyre as it hit our kerb and took off clearing the shrubbery before hitting the caravan it must have been some impact because there are parts of the car in the back garden a brake disc i think
4416099 it punched the caravan into the shed buckling the floor and the sheds hit the greenhouse my wifes fiestas a write off as well from the side impact my son has slept in that caravan before when weve had guests in the spare room ive mixed emotions this morning itll take a few days to get over obviously i feel for the two lads and their families
4416100 the investigation into the exact circumstances of this collision will continue but at this stage it is not believed that any other vehicle was involved nobody else was injured in the collision
4416101 we made the vehicle safe and then extricated the males we were guided by the paramedics as to how far we went
4416102 they were both caring lads both top lads who look after their mates just good lads and its a terrible shame whats happened and the way theyve gone
4416103 its got right through to everyone they say they wont be speeding any more it was just a crazy moment i was with him a few minutes before and he nipped out with one of his mates

4416112 the agency has recommended that indirect effects are included in future sustainability reporting and is working with the government to identify a way to do this
4416113 the shocking admission that we are unable to identify the origin of nearly half the biofuels used in the u k means that the government cannot assure the british people that the biofuels in their petrol tanks have not destroyed rainforests
4416114 it is really good that theyre asking these questions now when the mandate is a very small amount

4416126 there were punches that even stopped fighters in their tracks seemingly staggering the boxer who was hit but yet received no recognition on the scoreboard even commentators bob papa and teddy atlas were confused as to what punches would actually award a fighter with a point

4416144 meine eltern sind cdu w hler meine gro eltern sind cdu w hler ich glaube meine familie fragt sich manchmal schon woher ich das habe
4416145 wenn du in so einer menge menschen stehst und wei t jeder denkt dasselbe jeder protestiert f r eine bessere welt das ist bombastisch
4416146 die aktuellen sozialen bewegungen sind sehr junge bewegungen die leute wollen ein gemeinsames lebensgef hl teilen die kollektiven emotionen werden dabei immer wichtiger es werden gemeinsame weltsichten entwickelt die nicht ideologisch sind sondern eigene lebensentw rfe betreffen
4416147 mir geht es um die sache ehrlich meine freunde nennen die leute auf den demos langhaarige spin ner und sie haben manchmal leider recht da wei ich gar nicht ob die leute da sind weil gerade nichts anderes los ist oder weil sie sich wirklich f r klimaschutz einsetzen wollen
4416148 einige von denen lesen doch gar keine zeitung und parteien die gelten als b se es stimmt ja auch mit den gro en parteien kann ich mich auch nicht identifizieren zuviel rumgeeier
4416149 es ist nicht so dass ich parteien generell ablehne aber dieses hin und her das taktieren bei politischen entscheidungen das nervt und gerade wenn man gegen atomkraft ist ist es schwierig eine politische heimat zu finden die cdu f llt raus die spd kippt auch gerade um eigentlich bleiben da doch nur die gr nen
4416150 ob sich alle diese initiativen beim klimacamp wirklich b ndeln lassen ob wir dann wirklich an einem strang ziehen das wei ich auch nicht aber ich hoffe schon
4416151 es ist nicht so dass der protest zum symbol verkommt aber der protest splittet sich in einzelne politikfelder auf die inhalte sind da schon wichtig

4416166 all those who come to britain must play by the rules it is right that foreign students wanting to take advantage of our world class universities and colleges must meet strict criteria
4416167 by locking people to one identity with id cards alongside a tough new sponsorship system we will know exactly who is coming here to study and crack down on bogus colleges
4416168 i welcome the education sectors involvement in developing a structure that allows international students to benefit from the excellent educational experience the uk offers while giving them the opportunity to work in the uk for two years following graduation
4416169 however i will not tolerate the minority of individuals who seek to damage the quality of our education system through bogus colleges this is why we have introduced tighter checks to the current register of education and training providers the new system will toughen this process further and give extra protection from the damage bogus colleges can cause
4416170 the points based system is one of the biggest shake ups to the immigration system in a generation ensuring only those with the skills we need will be able to work or study here and no more
4416171 our message to businesses is loud and clear if you want to employ foreign workers from outside the eea you need to apply now for a sponsor licence business benefits from migrant labour but must join us in helping crack down on illegal working and ensure a system which is both firm and fair
4416172 we would expect a further fundamental change of mission in the first months of 2009
4416173 british troops and their families must be fed up of the series of nods and winks on withdrawal which often turn out to have no substance
4416174 our forces lives are on the line and it is about time that the government gave them some definite decisions rather than vague hopes
4416175 since june senators obama and clinton have been working together to ensure a democratic victory this november
4416176 they are both committed to winning back the white house and to ensuring that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver to honor and celebrate these voices and votes both senator obamas and senator clintons names will be placed in nomination
4416177 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4416178 the obama campaign has made no significant headway among former clinton backers over the past two months the voting preferences of clintons supporters are virtually identical to earlier polls in june and july
4416179 they have my absolute confidence and if i ever thought that a different decision needed to be made on that then i would act very swiftly
4416180 but i have no reason to think that mike duncan is not objective and is not a true professional
4416181 but i can tell you that if we determine there is wrongdoing on the part of any present employee of the cabinet i would think dismissal would be in order
4416182 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4416183 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4416184 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4416185 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide
4416186 im putting this question forward im putting the evidence forward voters can make up their own minds
4416187 if i had to go through this i could at least be an example of trying to live out whats right trying to stand strong and trying to just keep my faith intact
4416188 we gave the truth to the jury we are happy we had an opportunity to try our case
4416189 this lawsuit in my opinion should not have been filed because nothing happened
4416190 its a great vindication and shows us the faithfulness of god
4416191 in recent months we have listened to people across britain and the message is clear they want those who want to make britain their home to speak english to work hard and to earn the right to stay here
4416192 we are making the biggest changes to our immigration system for a generation and part of that is making sure those who stay in the uk make a positive impact on their local community
4416193 britain is not anti foreigner were a welcoming tolerant place but we do expect newcomers to sign up to a deal if they want to stay and build a life in britain
4416194 the public overwhelmingly supports the idea of newcomers earning their right to stay today we show how well make these ideas law hand in hand with our new points system for selective migration like the one thats worked so well in australia
4416195 forced marriage leads to victims suffering years of physical and mental abuse and in extreme cases unlawful imprisonment and rape
4416196 that is why we are raising the age limit for visas checking anyone entering into a marriage does so of their own free will and demanding that those coming to the uk learn english
4416197 british citizens have the right to marry whoever they choose but we want newcomers to succeed in our society and sign up to the standards we have in common that means freedom not being forced to marry someone and it means newcomers quickly acquiring a command of english with consequences for those who break the rules
4416198 even if people express interest theres no guarantee this will happen
4416199 the temporary work force is there to give us some flexibility so we can protect the jobs of our permanent team members
4416200 is essentially the plant that weve got thats in the best shape because its building cars not trucks
4416201 i was looking at why these black women were organizing themselves differently why were they separate then i understood the racist notions of purity and pollution that operates there just like our situation the black women dont have leadership in the mainstream womens movement the white women were not going to solve the problems of black women black women had their own struggles they had their own history of resistance they not only wrote about the racist inequality but they spoke about the class struggle they outlined the economic oppression the absence of land and resources there are so many connections between the dalits and the blacks
4416202 i was looking over at yang wei and thinking that it was really cool to watch that
4416203 that motivates me i said to mark thats going to be me in four years im going to stay dedicated i feel that i have the ability
4416204 he didnt have the velcro in his feet that he had tuesday
4416205 but he had a good day hes already talking about coming back in four years and being one of the guys people expect to medal
4416206 with this team i dont think nervous is even a factor until you get a couple of outs in the seventh
4416207 i really felt that in the canada game we needed someone to come out there and throw zeroes up until we could get the bats going
4416208 and the way cats been pitching i figured we could count on her to come through
4416209 i was ready to go if he needed me against japan and he changed things up at the last second which was fine we just have to all be ready at any point in time there are only three of us pitchers its all about matchups right now and who theyre throwing
4416210 but i felt good out there on the mound weve played canada enough times and i know their hitters really well i felt like i was on a roll with them if we got one run and went ahead that would be ok but we obviously went ahead and put quite a few on the board
4416211 its not that we dont think about ever losing its just that we know what were capable of doing in the fifth inning you still have two at bats to go and we have a deep enough lineup that you cant get through 1 9 in our lineup without facing 1 9 good hitters
4416212 were not really dominant like people say we are we play a lot of competitive tournaments all around the world every year the difference is that the only time people really pay attention and see is in the olympics and we were dominant in athens we were flat out the best team
4416213 obviously we know that we have a bulls eye on our back all the time and the good thing is that we have athletes who thrive on that theyre very competitive and they understand the history of this program and do their part to prepare themselves thats why theyre in that uniform because theyre ready
4416214 by the rivers of babylon there we sat down yea we wept when we remembered zion we hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof for there they that carried us away captive required of us a song and they who wasted us required of us mirth saying sing us one of the songs of zion how can we sing the lords song in a strange land if i forget thee 0 jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning if i do not remember thee let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth
4416215 may my right hand forget her cunning and may my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth
4416216 it is just in this circumstance that you and your brother abolitionists fail to make a favorable impression on the public mind would you argue more an denounce less would you persuade more and rebuke less your cause would be much more likely to succeed
4416217 reflections on the black womans role in the community of slaves
4416218 we are all damaged people merely by virtue of being black women
4416219 the advantage of using the icelandic data set lies in this population being small and one of the most socioeconomically and culturally homogenous societies in the world
4416220 with little variation in family size and use of contraceptives and marriage practices in contrast with most previously studied populations
4416221 with close inbreeding between first cousins there is a significant increase in the probability that both partners will share one or more detrimental recessive genes leading to a 25 percent chance that these genes will be expressed in each pregnancy

4416228 we became a b corporation because we have always operated our business in a way that supports all of our stakeholders interests
4416229 we are a triple bottom line focused company and we are excited to be part of a broader community of organizations that share a common vision
4416230 in past years we have been able to go ahead with the teaching of some classes that have not met the required minimum enrollments but because of the cost cutting this year we must be stricter and cancel classes that do not have the minimum enrollments
4416231 there is a hiring freeze in effect and we have been allowed to hire some temporary people only in areas that are considered critical to the operation of wnc
4416232 but were doing our best to retain all the scheduled classes and most of the student services but we had to cut about 350 000 from our maintenance budget and were even bracing for more cuts
4416233 as of now were keeping most of the cuts on the back end of our operations but i cant predict the future
4416234 we are doing our very best to protect our students and retain our scheduled classes we are being frugal and trying to keep all our important programs
4416235 have had a direct negative and severe impact on our students
4416236 western nevada college has cut 35 vacant positions that will remain unfilled to meet budget restrictions

4416244 its an open secret western analysts have been writing about it that the current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states and of course it must be hurtful to see a prot g making such a sleazy performance
4416245 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by in st louis
4416246 the conflict is a very dangerous one not so much because georgia and south ossetia can inflict enormous damage on each other but because they serve as surrogates for the renewed rivalry between the us and russia let me begin with russia because of its new oil wealth russia is now economically a strong country in many ways more so than it has ever been in its history because of its natural gas exports russia has gained enormous political power i e germany gets over 40 of its natural gas from russia which gives russia a very powerful political weapon combined this makes it possible for russia to stand up again as a superpower and put an end to the humiliation that so many russians felt for their country during the yeltsin years equally important georgia has built an oil and soon a gas pipeline which will carry oil and gas from central asia this will end russias monopoly control over access to energy in central asia this in itself makes georgia a target for russia russia as the controller and protector of both gazprom and transneft could not tolerate this challenge as for georgia it has always had an independent streak and the georgians have never been happy to take russian dictate the us has been quite willing to take advantage of this attitude to do what it can to make sure that georgia does not find itself bullied by russia that is necessary to ensure that russia is unable to reconstitute the ussr if georgia becomes intimidated by russia the fear is that soon ukraine the baltics and even central asia will be next

4416250 the fire from jet fuel does not burn hot enough to produce the physical evidence that hes produced
4416251 so when youve got science that the hypothesis doesnt explain evidence then the hypothesis doesnt stand anymore it doesnt mean theres a new hypothesis youve validated it just means the governments explanation of the jet fuel fire is not a sufficient explanation to explain the evidence of these spheres these microscopic spheres that steven jones has proved existed within the w t c dust
4416252 every day we learn something new that completely undercuts corsis credibility
4416253 georgia relied on israeli generals as well as israeli weapons and faced failure
4416254 what happened in georgia is a message to all those governments who rely on americas support and encouragement to go on adventures and wars which has not been studied
4416255 confrontations which see no end and at the end abandon
4416256 quite simply to support with the authority of the security council the six point medvedev sarkozy plan and it is a completely different territory now
4416257 there is the question of the will of the people of abkhazia and south ossetia and we believe all these needs must be reflected in the thinking of the international community

4416261 u s military transport aircraft are reported to have been airlifting some humanitarian cargoes to tbilisi airport two days ago reports said we had destroyed the airport
4416262 this is not true we have not been engaged in any military action for two days only conducting reconnaissance
4416263 there are a lot of weapons which need to be guarded to prevent them from being stolen and used
4416264 the withdrawal plan has not been approved yet the buildup of the units has been suspended
4416265 do i really need it do i have something like this at home
4416266 yes in this moment i think this might make me happy

4416270 and for us having this album finally hit stores and having the fans sing the songs knowing that they can actually hear them and have it in their possession is the most amazing thing for us were so excited
4416271 we will be an option but the fact is newsday still has a very strong franchise they were the only store in town and now were the second store like avis were going to try harder
4416272 its an advertising marketing partnership that we hope will expand as we continue to grow on long island
4416273 companies appear to be being pretty conservative and theres not a lot of hiring going on
4416274 the best you can say for it is that while the nation has been losing jobs since january long island is still in positive territory the job gains are very very modest

4416278 na ja jetzt darf ich immerhin die ein oder andere akte hin und herschleppen
4416279 hab ich trotzdem nicht ich bin erst seit einer stunde hier
4416280 sie haben gestern nacht einen jungen eingeliefert er war sp rlich bekleidet und hatte blo eine holzkette bei sich
4416281 er sitzt die ganze zeit nur am fenster und starrt l cher in die luft
4416282 du bist verr ckt wen interessiert denn so ein bl der junge
4416283 er hat bestimmt schreckliches erlebt vielleicht wurden seine eltern vor seinen augen erschossen
4416284 vielleicht hatte er gar keine eltern und er musste sich ganz allein durchschlagen und jetzt ist er krank geworden
4416285 oder er ist aus einem weisenhaus geflohen weil er gefoltert wurde
4416286 ich m chte nichts mehr ber den jungen h ren
4416287 hast du schon geh rt amy hat mit leo geschlafen
4416288 i missed a couple of key opportunities to score and ill never get them back ill never get them back
4416289 the dollar is the best looking horse in the glue factory
4416290 weve all got problems but relatively speaking the us is not looking as bad
4416291 one of the most obvious areas is the uk where growth is falling off a cliff
4416292 the uk has the same disease we have but worse their economy is much more concentrated in real estate and financial services
4416293 i think people went way out over their skis on that trade because it had worked so well
4416294 as things began to go the other way all of a sudden theres a big whoosh and people have to scramble to buy dollars and maybe sell some of their oil futures
4416295 hes all you would want in a quarterback and a leader right now
4416296 the last three days i would say luke has made a push just in terms of confidence and knowledge of assignment
4416297 hes all you would want in a quarterback and a leader right now
4416298 any time you go through camp you expect ups and downs with freshmen and they have to be able to handle it mentally and physically
4416299 he is prepared physically he has done a nice job of understanding the mental side of the whole thing from a technique standpoint to the mental grind in the last 48 hours
4416300 we still have a couple weeks left and still have some sorting out to do
4416301 hopefully well have that solidified by a week from saturday its getting closer but theyre still 1 and 1 a like weve talked about and whoever takes the first snap in the game is inconsequential its a matter of getting them both healthy and ready to go
4416302 hopefully they notice my good things and what i need to improve on
4416303 i want to be the man ill do whatever to help the team but i want to be that guy
4416304 clint didnt hurt his reputation when he was here he was a great guy in the locker room and i dont feel like he did anything bad i think the main problem for clint is that people were expecting so much out of him and frankly the team around him wasnt good enough for him to be a star
4416305 the next match will be the match of our lives so were looking forward to that each match has been more important than the other well keep our excitement celebrating every point thats how we play best
4416306 weve been in tight games before but not in the olympics and not on this big stage
4416307 in my wildest imagination i didnt think they would throw at my players coconut
4416308 it was a lack of respect on the part of the american coach to say that
4416309 the cuban team respects the game and respects our opponents and is incapable of doing that
4416310 although not all my times werent exactly there during this meet im very happy with the results
4416311 you definitely can swim faster out there said wildman tobriner who tied amaury leveaux for fourth in his heat with a time of 21 76 seconds
4416312 if it were all over today hed be the greatest olympian who ever lived
4416313 im down to the last two races and im just going to try to rest and recover the best that i can and prepare myself for those two races
4416314 i wasnt planning on the back hurting as bad as it did

4416317 she stuck basically all the tumbling passes thats incredible to do
4416318 for us paul is not a figure of the past whom we recall with veneration
4416319 he gave us a most personal profession of faith his faith is the experience of being loved by jesus christ in a personal way it is knowledge of the fact that christ faced death not for something anonymous but for love of him of paul and that as the risen lord he still loves him christ gave himself for him his faith is being struck by the love of jesus christ a love which overwhelms and transforms him his faith is not a theory an opinion on god and the world his faith is the impact of gods love on his heart so this faith is in fact love for jesus christ
4416320 for paul the truth was too great to be sacrificed for any external success the truth he had experience in his encounter with the risen christ was for him worth strife persecution suffering he was deeply motivated by the fact that he felt loved by jesus christ and felt a desire to share this love with others paul was a man struck by a great love and his work and suffering are explained by this nucleus
4416321 paul was free as a man loved by god and who through god was able to love with him anyone who loves christ as paul loved him can do anything because his love is united with the will of christ and so with the will of god because his will is anchored in the truth and his will is not only his will arbitrary of the autonomous i instead it is integrated in the freedom of god and from this receives the way it is to walk
4416322 by persecuting the church paul was persecuting jesus himself christ did not retire to heaven leaving a host of followers on earth to run his cause the church is not an association which promotes a cause in the church it is not a matter of a cause it is a question of the person of jesus christ who even as the risen lord was still flesh he has a body he is personally present in his church in all this we glimpse the eucharistic mystery in which christ continues to give his body and make us into his body continually christ draws us into his body he builds up his body starting from the eucharistic centre which for paul is the heart of christian life through which all of us and as every individual can experience in a personal way he loved me and gave himself for me
4416323 we thank the lord because he called paul making him light of the nations and teacher for us all and we pray give us today witnesses of the resurrection filled with your love and able to carry the light of the gospel in our times saint pray for us amen
4416324 radical conversion and the apostolic kerygma of saul of tarsus shook history in the literal sense of the word and outlined the actual identity of christianity this holy place outside the walls is most appropriate for commemorating and celebrating a man who combined the greek language and the roman mentality of his day stripping christianity once and for all of any mental restriction and forging for ever the catholic foundation of the ecumenical church let us hope that the life and the letters of st paul may continue to be for us a source of inspiration that all peoples may obey faith in christ
4416325 against heresies where among other things he wrote against gnosticism in this excerpt he describes how jesus by his flesh and blood grants salvation to us in our flesh and blood
4416326 for we have given nothing to him previously nor does he desire anything from us as if he stood in need of it but we do stand in need of fellowship with him and for this reason it was that he graciously poured himself out that he might gather us into the bosom of the father
4416327 in whom we have redemption through his blood even the remission of sins
4416328 we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones
4416329 by his own blood he redeemed us as also his apostle paul declares in whom we have redemption through his blood even the remission of sins colossians 1 14
4416330 with jesus promise concerning the church and her life under gods guidance protection and blessing we see also how he looks ahead choosing men to carry on his work in the apostolic ministry
4416331 if jesus is the divine and human rock on which the church is built peter and his confession are the human means through which the lord builds his church the lord continues to reign graciously among us and prepare us for the last day when he will come to judge the living and the dead in the meantime the church continues to make the same loving confession as peter as we confess the nicene creed in the meantime we live in the lords promise made certain by his cross that though the church suffers on earth though she is attacked and rejected even hell cannot prevail against her for even as christ reigns in heaven above so he reigns among us ever precious food supplying lsb 630 guiding protecting and blessing us and enriching and enlivening his church on earth with the forgiveness of sins all along preparing us for eternal life in his kingdom amen
4416332 the manifest majority was profoundly short sighted at every point it could have offered reassurances and it did not do that
4416333 weve got people talking about defection they were clearly talking about the global anglican future conference held last month in jerusalem which ended with the threat of an anglican breakaway weve got a lot of soul searching to do
4416334 i feel ashamed we have talked about wanting to give an honourable place for those who disagree and we have turned down almost every realistic opportunity we have not even been prepared to explore the possibility of fresh expressions of dioceses or bishops and still we talk the talk of being inclusive
4416335 its getting worse its going downhill very badly its quite clear theres a pincer movement and were being squeezed out there is only one way forward a code of practice
4416336 there might be some things that we might eventually have to split over this should not be one of them
4416337 while acknowledging the nature of canterbury as an historic see we do not accept that anglican identity is determined necessarily through recognition by the archbishop of canterbury
4416338 we reject the authority of those churches and leaders who have denied the orthodox faith in word or deed
4416339 it was bound to happen maybe unborn babies will be next
4416340 the fundamental rule of the honour we pay to the blessed virgin and the saints is this that we must entirely refer it all to god and to our eternal salvation
4416341 to come to particulars in the matter there are two special points concerning prayer to our lady and the saints on which the church is accused by her enemies of erroneous practices the first of which is idolatry
4416342 we christians adore but one god single omnipotent creator and dispensor of all things in whose name we were consecrated at baptism and in whom
4416343 the second accusation commonly made against us is that we make for ourselves
4416344 there is yet another principle involved in the true doctrine of honour to the saints which must be touched upon before we leave the subject and that is the great advantage to ourselves contained in practising devotion towards them of a right sort the christian is bound to imitate what he honours and the object of his worship must also be the model of his life his god is a perfect god and hence he must try to make himself perfect and worship only those who have given honour to their maker by imitating his perfections when we venerate the saints it is not to increase their glory that is full they have their perfect measure of it with god in heaven we pay them homage over and above the motive of giving glory to god that we may incite ourselves to follow them and we ask their prayers for the same purpose this is the sense of the church in instituting the feasts she does in honour of the saints and it is shown in the collect for st stephens day which says o lord give us grace to imitate that which we honour it is the constant tradition of the church that the most essential part of devotion to the blessed in heaven is to profit by their example without this all homage is vain whatever individual saint we are devout to we must try to acquire that ones special virtues and most of all are we bound to do this where the queen of all saints the virgin of virgins is concerned if we deeply revere as every true catholic does the virginal chastity which enabled her to conceive the son of god in her womb we can duly express our veneration only by doing our best according to our states of life to imitate it in our own souls so far does st ambrose go in his conviction of the power which the reverent imitation of marys virtue may confer on her true clients that he says every chaste soul that keeps its purity and innocence untarnished conceives the eternal wisdom in itself and is filled with god and his grace after the pattern of mary
4416345 its clear who is giving the orders in reality were looking at russias president putin and vice prime minister medvedev its pretty clear that this is not a war run by the russian president but a personal vendetta on georgia by vladimir putin
4416346 ssm is bad for children because studies show that children do best in families with a mother and father
4416347 we must prohibit marriages that are shown to be harmful to children
4416348 group x has bad parenting outcomes therefore they should not be allowed to marry
4416349 but it has nothing to do with religion it has everything to do with inconsistencies in positions hes held
4416350 traffic has slowed down back to junction 17 but it is still moving
4416351 we just told the family this past monday they thought it was great news i couldnt hide it any more the second time you show faster
4416352 i point to my belly and tell her theres a baby in my belly
4416353 she points to her belly button and thinks theres a baby there
4416354 ive been able to come back into my daughters life and that was an adjustment anyway because im an alcoholic and its the first time weve really been able to share
4416355 every now and then ill stay if we have something early in the morning we have to do
4416356 i would hope that the conservatorship stands until the end of the year and then well sit back and evaluate where we are at the time where britney is at that time
4416357 it made no sense for that trial to proceed so we worked out an agreement
4416358 the agreement says that on oct 1 well probably get another overnight and that will stay in place until the end of the year or the end of the conservatorship
4416359 kevin has a wonderful heart i dont agree with giving him more money he wants them to raise these kids together kevins heart is right
4416360 my soul magnifies the lord and my spirit has rejoiced in god my savior
4416361 there can be no future for christianity in europe without rome
4416362 its quite clear there is a pincer movement and we are being squeezed out we are being pushed by a particular liberal agenda and we are going to have women bishops at the exclusion of any other view
4416363 i am deeply unhappy with schemes or solutions which involve the structural humiliation of women who are elected to the episcopate and end up haggling about the limits to their authority
4416364 the popes closest advisers are not in a mood to allow the bishops the same freedom this time they are already cross at the poor english response to the motu proprio liberating the latin liturgy and have conveyed their displeasure to the relevant bishops in no uncertain terms
4416365 the anglican traditionalists know that they cannot trust a catholic bishop not to shop them to rowan williams so the liberal rc hierarchy has been quite properly kept in the dark
4416366 la mejor manera de recordar a los nuestros es exigiendo a las autoridades que respeten sus memorias que el gobierno nos explique d nde est n los 1 123 millones de soles que se dice han sido invertidos en la reconstrucci n de pisco queremos que nos expliquen d nde est el nuevo hospital que el gobierno est construyendo qu ha hecho el alcalde juan mendoza con los millones que recibe de ayuda internacional

4416371 hes pretty but acts like hes 12 so yeah id fuck him
4416372 we must never forget that the church is built around christ and that as sts augustine thomas aquinas and albert the great have all said following st paul the eucharist is the sacrament of the churchs unity because we all form one single body of which the lord is the head
4416373 we must go back again and again to the last supper on holy thursday where we were given a pledge of the mystery of our redemption on the cross
4416374 may all of you become ever more deeply aware of the importance of the sunday eucharist
4416375 because sunday the first day of the week is the day when we honor christ the day when we receive the strength to live each day the gift of god
4416376 and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life
4416377 and this food is called by us the eucharist of which no one is allowed to partake but he who believes that the things which we teach are true and who has been washed in the bath for the forgiveness of sins and to regeneration and who so lives as christ has directed for not as ordinary bread and ordinary drink do we receive these but in like manner as by the word of god jesus christ our savior was made flesh and had both flesh and blood for our salvation so also the food which is blessed by the prayer of the word which proceeded from him and from which our flesh and blood by transmutation are nourished is we are taught the flesh and blood of that jesus who was made flesh for the apostles in the memoirs which they composed and which are called gospels have declared that they were commanded to do as follows that jesus took bread and gave thanks and said this do in remembrance of me this is my body and in like manner he gave thanks and said this is my blood and gave it to them alone apology i 62

4416381 speculation is going to go on for the next three or four weeks and i could talk about every player we are linked with
4416382 some of them would be yes some would be no and some i would never have heard of it would just be agents trying to drum up interest in their players as the window comes to a close
4416383 i would rather not get into individuals because i think its a waste of time
4416384 selain kalangan pabrikan fatwa ini akan menghantam kehidupan jutaan petani tembakau di indonesia termasuk kami
4416385 tapi dampak merokok itu sangat individu jadi biarkan warga memilih sendiri untuk merokok atau tidak mui jangan memaksakan diri melarang merokok melalui fatwa dikarenakan agama islam memang tidak mengharamkannya

4416478 he was talking to her and touching her in an inappropriate manner
4416479 the young lady made the allegations and he admitted the conduct
4416480 obviously the sheriff felt there was sufficient evidence to substantiate the allegations and took the appropriate actions
4416481 if the sheriff deems the conduct to be serious enough he can basically bypass the basic discipline steps and go straight to suspension or termination
4416482 like any other situation involving a deputy the other deputies dont want to work with somebody who has problems or has issues i think theyre happy its been addressed so quickly and taken care of
4416483 law enforcement officers are held to a higher standard of conduct but we are human and make mistakes its just that the sheriffs office doesnt condone that kind of conduct one bit

4416509 we are very pleased with all of the results we have received thus far and what is most exciting is that it has become more apparent that there is plenty of upside potential to expand the high grade core of the deposit in addition to the lower grade material in the periphery the positive results of our scoping study reflect that this deposit is amenable to low cost underground bulk mining methods and that the project enjoys excellent infrastructure advantages

4416515 we are pleased that our increased business activities were positively reflected in our quarterly results
4416516 our revenue for the second quarter was almost double the figure from our first quarter while net income showed significant growth as well we attribute these results to strong demand in the bottling and bottle equipment market as well as our expansion into pharmaceutical packaging these areas have led to a steady stream of new contracts from both domestic and overseas clients
4416517 in the second half of 2008 we plan to participate in more industry exhibitions to broaden our customer base and increase brand awareness
4416518 in addition we plan to continue enhancing our sales and service departments to increase our client retention rate among both domestic and overseas clients as a result of the increase in the price of raw materials in the first half of 2008 we intend to focus on higher end products in order to maintain a gross margin of roughly 30 percent
4416519 for over 50 years downeys number one priority has been to focus on providing our customers with outstanding service
4416520 we are encouraged by our positive relationships with our valued depositors and by the stabilization we have seen in deposit activity this month
4416521 the second quarter of the year is usually our seasonally second strongest quarter due to the larger harvest of cactus crops at this time of year during this past quarter we continued to shift our product mix towards nutritional food products and dietary supplements and were pleased to see year over year growth in these product lines of 62 and 232 respectively
4416522 the acquisition of jin ao a soy milk manufacturing facility will further help us expand our presence in the nutritional food market
4416523 we have been able to retain our gross profit margin above 50 by improving production efficiencies and reducing production by third party manufacturers we will continue to cooperate with farmers to ensure smooth raw material supplies
4416524 we believe our gross profit margin will continue to stay above this level as we are able to obtain premium prices for our products due to the high demand for health promoting food and our unique product offerings
4416525 in the second half of the year we will continue to focus on increasing sales of our nutritional products and developing new products we plan to expand our footprint throughout china by opening additional franchise stores and increasing sales at existing stores
4416526 we are particularly excited about the acquisition of jin ao as it highlights the shift in our sales mix towards products that appeal to a larger market we firmly believe that soy milk will become a significant source of revenue given the enormous growth potential in china for convenient and urban products tailored to the local palette
4416527 my vision for my garden of plenty is a small manageable herb and veggie garden to call my own with various medicinal and culinary herbs in it as well as veggies it needs to be small enough to manage as i still work full time and dont have much relaxation time available the garden should be pleasing to the eye with a sense of accomplishment and achievement but not too formal i do have a part time gardener that will help me with the heavy labour as the property does have a lot of rock it will be as an example and demonstration of what can be achieved and used for my relaxation
4416528 what i need and what i would like from my garden would be to be able to pick fresh veggies and herbs as the need arises the need being for the kitchen as well as for the pretty of it on my table and in and around my house to lighten up and set the scene for entertaining obviously letting the seasons and growth time dictate what i will be able to harvest it will be so great to pick the exact amount you require instead of purchasing what is on the shelf and wasting by throwing away the excess i want to have my own compost heap or worm farm so that i can use most or all of my vegetable or organic waste matter in a planet friendly way by fermenting it and then using it in my garden of plenty to enhance the quantity and quality of my gardens contents and inhabitants i am not skilled in gardening and will have to rely heavily on books and this course to give me easy and good guidance and direction i have a full time gardener who is very keen and willing to assist in creating and maintaining this garden i will possibly only be the project manager so to say and the gardener will be the implementer as for financial resources i will have to be realistic and start small and see what works for me us before i will spend bigger amounts and then they might not succeed my completed garden should feel informal and look natural blending in with the flower beds that will be surrounding it not like a typical vegetable patch on a farm i want to plant herbs in between the veggies to control the pests will need loads of help on this one i would love to attract bees into this garden and if at all possibly set up an environment to also attract birds by feeding them from a perch all in all i would love to walk outside and use my garden of plenty for my families healthy cooking and living
4416529 not only did the dispute resolution chamber of fifa make us a very significant monetary award it also recognised the damaging effect incidents involving drugs has on football and the responsibility we all have in this area
4416530 speculation about either of these cyclones hitting florida is definitely a reason why orange juice prices are stronger
4416531 the agreements content and the haste with which the two sides reached it allow the conclusion that the project is actually aimed against russia
4416532 to a real increase in tension in russian american relations
4416533 a lot of younger employees want to take their parents to the workplace to show them around it becomes almost a given or they would participate in a family day younger people are staying in touch with their parent even at work often several times a day
4416534 weve heard of a couple instances of parents calling up when they were unhappy with performance reviews people are talking to their parents five times a day they ask a lot of questions now in the workplace it drives their bosses crazy if they expect an immediate response from a manager they might not get it
4416535 she was going to knock it out of the park
4416536 one of the things is to manage expectations an employer needs to be parental coaching in dealing with conflict and criticism to remind a young person they are an adult part of it is defining who you are how to live independently explaining that this is your job and your life and you will be held accountable
4416537 youre not only recruiting the child youre recruiting the parent understand that every step of the negotiation process even though their parents are not present employees are going back to their parents at home theyre going to be involved in every step of the process a lot of employees will come in with expectations fueled by parents sometimes they give up easily they do want to see things happen quickly when that doesnt happen they often get frustrated and move on so companies need to adapt
4416538 part of it is that the boomers worked so hard with mother and father in the workplace theyre trying to make up for time spent working and they have very high standards for their offspring its very much a culture where they want to participate in what their kids do
4416539 interestingly i hear from teachers elementary or middle school that the gen y parents are even worse this whole hovering phenomenon is becoming part of how society operates its very child centered gen y are the generation thats had more attention than any in history when we talk about helicopter parents its a small percentage its just that its a big change in the workplace
4416540 its important to note that helicopter parenting is pretty specific to certain socioeconomic populations not all parents of millennials have the time or resources to hover over their kids all the time its more prevalent among affluent parents who have really pushed their kids to succeed all their lives who did all the scheduling of sports practices and music lessons and helped them apply for college and never manage to lower their level of involvement even after they move out of the house
4416541 in some ways theres an opportunity there are plenty of gen yrs who are professional and mature and they are really sticking out now theres now a meaningful way to distinguish themselves
4416542 its been exciting its great to get attention for myself and for track cycling but im ready to get racing
4416543 im trying not to get too wrapped up in it its been overwhelming at times im not the kind of person who just goes and does a photo shoot i have to remember why im here its about the competition thats what ive been training for
4416544 being a first time olympian ive never been in a situation like this
4416545 its been overwhelming to even come here adding more attention on myself for wearing the masks did a little bit to stress me out for me i just try to surround myself with close friends and talk with my family
4416546 i cant be walking around that much i need to keep it loose and keep myself working mechanically
4416547 for some people the opening ceremonies pumps them up i was just taking time to prepare i watched it on tv
4416548 the whole point of what we were meaning to do is to have the best performance if i feel its necessary i wear it
4416549 i have hand sanitizer and ive been washing my hands a lot too
4416550 i thought if i flopped something here my ace might be the best hand and i could make a big pot
4416551 maybe he thinks i have a draw maybe he thinks i have 3 5 and im looking for a deuce or maybe he thinks i have two big overcards
4416552 im thinking he could have a full house so i was going to play the hand cautiously
4416553 or maybe he was on a stone cold bluff figuring i didnt have a 6 or maybe i have two overcards
4416554 i was pretty sure i had the best hand but i wasnt going to make it into a big pot and risk getting check raised
4416555 i was just going to let him fire into the pot
4416556 when he checked the river i checked behind him because i didnt want to get check raised i didnt have the nuts if i bet he could check raise in that spot and id have to fold because so many hands had gotten there on the river
4416557 theres really not any equity in playing big pots unless youve flopped the joint and youre the one making it big
4416558 i am very disappointed to hear that my publishers have canceled another authors novel apparently because of their concerns about possible islamic reprisals

4416566 i believe there is now too much pressure in the climbing world for ever more daring and dangerous feats
4416567 the nick estcourt award was set up to honour nick estcourt who died in an avalanche on k2 and it was this very award that gave ben the opportunity to go out to pakistan
4416568 it is tragic that ben has met his fate in the same way
4416569 i would ask all climbers out there to remember ben cheek and the men who were killed on k2
4416570 before attempting anything like what they did please stop to think
4416571 an avalanche could take your life too and leave your family shattered forever
4416572 i cant believe that my brother will never come home again
4416573 why not life is short life is dull life is full of pain why not do something special
4416574 a possible motive for the killing is beginning to emerge concerning the lifestyle of xi zhou and zhen xing yang

4416585 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4416586 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4416587 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4416588 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4416589 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4416590 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4416591 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4416592 we have a lot of doctor bills and hospital bills that were paying on theres no question about it i have to work now
4416593 because gas prices are going up and utilities are going up theyre having to make adjustments in terms of where their spending is going
4416594 because of that they have to put off some of these other purchases and reduce their spending and tighten their belts
4416595 the squeeze for elderly people has been going on for 20 some years its not a new situation its just the squeeze is greater
4416596 theyre really struggling to make ends meet in all areas
4416597 with the downturn in the stock market a lot of those who rely on their dividends and income from investments are sort of hit that way and it lowers their overall income
4416598 in combination with inflation in gas and food prices it is bound to be hitting them pretty hard
4416599 physicians are very concerned about it because a lot of doctors they write prescriptions but if the patients arent able to get the prescriptions filled then obviously that has a huge impact on patient health
4416600 its really unfortunate in the richest country in the world that people have got to choose between medically necessary prescriptions or medical tests and procedures and food
4416601 now at our meetings we will mention where we found the cheapest gas and that never used to be a subject that came up even as an honorable mention
4416602 mit der cns haben wir einen partner gefunden der sich ebenso wie die cma f r eine wissenschaftlich fundierte ausgewogene ern hrung einsetzt
4416603 die kooperation auf wissenschaftlicher ebene wird die bestehende zusammenarbeit zwischen deutschland und china auch auf wirtschaftlicher ebene verst rken und das image und den absatz deutscher agrarprodukte f rdern
4416604 today a guy who owns a sport team is somebody who has generated a big pile of money in some other industry and its very likely that their primordial financial interests and instincts are rooted in that other industry
4416605 once the primary season was over the battle ax was buried and we became one team
4416606 i dont think theres any correlation between being a sports owner and supporting i think theres a correlation between being a businessman and supporting john mccain
4416607 although i have business issues and i have differences with sen obama on some tax issues thats overridden by my commitment to what i believe he will contribute to the overall good of the country
4416608 some nba owners are republicans some nba owners are democrats
4416609 but one thing they have in common is theyre all businessmen
4416610 we have a policy that if any season ticket holder runs for president of the united states we are going to support him
4416611 beim freitauchen gibt es keine atemger te die lunge ist zusammengepresst und mit blutplasma gef llt das schafft ein raucher nicht
4416612 bevor ich abtauche muss ich meinen herzschlag mit speziellen yoga hnlichen bungen auf 12 bis 14 schl ge pro minute bringen
4416613 w hrend des trainings bin ich beim auftauchen auch schon mal bewusstlos geworden da hatte ich meine leistungskraft falsch eingesch tzt
4416614 ich riskiere nichts deshalb werde ich auch nie einen schlitten zum tieftauchen benutzen mit dem schon weltrekorde von ber 200 meter getaucht wurden doch dabei sind auch schon sportler ums leben gekommen
4416615 neptun gib uns gelassenheit dinge hinzunehmen die wir nicht ndern k nnen
4416616 ich war mit zwei freunden einem engl nder und einer schweizerin in der stadt verabredet doch ich kam 15 minuten zu sp t zum treffpunkt f r mich ein gl ck f r meine freunde ein ungl ck
4416617 selbstmordattent ter sprengten touristen und einheimische an drei belebten pl tzen in die luft es gab 25 tote darunter ein deutscher junge ber 50 menschen wurden verletzt die freundin aus der schweiz verlor ein bein der engl nder hat splitter im k rper die schrecklichen bilder werde ich nie vergessen
4416618 ich hatte erlebt was sprengstoffe anrichten k nnen als minentaucher wollte ich dazu beitragen dass sprengfallen und minen beseitigt werden k nnen ich bewarb mich bei den minentauchern
4416619 jeder marinesoldat kann sich f r eine ausbildung zum minentaucher bewerben
4416620 doch es bewerben sich nur gut ein dutzend soldaten und schon beim vorbereitungstest fallen ber 70 prozent der bewerber durch
4416621 die leute sind nicht mehr bereit sich zu qu len
4416622 ich habe w hrend des minentaucherlehrgangs nie ans aufgeben gedacht auch wenn es sehr hart war ich will tauchen ich will viel wasser um mich haben und das finde ich nur bei den minentauchern der marine
4416623 am verlangten niveau k nnen wir keine abstriche machen das w rde nur das leben der soldaten selbst gef hrden und weil wir eine so harte auswahl treffen gab es bisher erst sehr wenige unf lle bei den minentauchern
4416624 solange ein freitaucher nicht alleine trainiert und nichts riskiert ist das abtauchen ungef hrlich
4416625 half an hour ago i read a review of the film that just kind of attacked it
4416626 its tragic he lost his wife but he made this faith based hallmark card
4416627 i was coming out of the loss of my wife i was looking for a film that i could shoot here because i have a young daughter and something that kind of spoke to the experience i was going through it was scripter
4416628 it was this beautiful small story about this guy who was dealing with his desire to be safe and there was a search for life and hope in it that was kind of paralleling what i was going through in my grief recovery
4416629 to be able to find a story that you can really connect to on a personal level and then be able to kind of put yourself into was for me personally a gift
4416630 ive always thought that whatever youve gone through in your life whatever your connectivity to the world and your own feelings of or exploration of mortality and asking about the bigger questions in life that the people who bring that to the table may experience it on a different level than somebody else
4416631 it really depends on your world view and your own life experience
4416632 where i was three years ago in healing and trying to get the movie made
4416633 is very different from where i am now four years after she passed away and after having made the film
4416634 so i dont have to direct movies i dont love

4416637 you know the toughest interview ive ever had was with your father in law
4416638 man dont just bring your metheny game to a charlie haden interview
4416639 believe me i did some research too are you kidding me i wanted to marry his daughter i watched all 10 hours of that ken burns jazz documentary but im still a novice i know better than to broach the subject
4416640 fare thee well ol joe clark fare thee well i saaaaay
4416641 fare thee well old joe clark im goin way to staaaaay a bluegrass standard a classic ive never sung that style before but i felt i was channeling my own hickory flavored ancestors for that
4416642 i havent done multiple character comedies that are all about farting but i do fart in some of my movies and i am fat in well pretty much all my movies so i understand this guy theres a little chris farley john belushi a little angry tom sizemore in there too ive phased the excess partying out of my life but the guy is not a long trip for me to take
4416643 at last reminding audiences of why they thought school of rock was so funny
4416644 hes not doing anything funny with his hair hes not paralyzed hes playing an almost generic european stud but because its bardem hes doing it with a lot more shadings than weve ever seen before
4416645 he looks like a caveman and has the soul of an aesthete he can be self deprecating and he can be brutal he can play comedy or tragedy he can play a great artist or a peasant and be completely convincing in either role hes the whole package
4416646 you dont have to rewrite it to fit your conception of the character which is often the case
4416647 and feeling safe with the words gives you extra time just to concentrate on the performance
4416648 he wanted us to experiment to push as hard as we could into extreme behavior and then if he thought it was necessary to bring it down a bit he wanted those two characters to represent the instability in relationships
4416649 the thing is you have to let it go sure you celebrate enjoy the celebrity drink a bit but then let it go its not real
4416650 a porous medium is a solid structure with interconnected voids
4416651 a porous medium is a region in space comprising of at least two homogeneous material constituents presenting identifiable interfaces between them in a resolution level with at least one of the constituent remaining fixed or slightly deformable
4416652 if we dont at least start by allowing in unskilled laborers for a limited period and for a limited number of times and then come up with long term solutions japan wont have a sufficient work force the deadline is approaching

4416662 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4416663 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4416664 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4416665 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4416666 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state

4416668 we have helped our customers cut bag use by 40 without a bag tax adding to the cost of their weekly shop in fact our green clubcard scheme helps people save on their grocery shopping bills
4416669 our customers have shown us how keen they are to break this environmentally damaging habit of a lifetime the
4416670 it took more than 14 months to save the first billion bags but the second billion was achieved in less than 9 months showing that the trend is rapidly gaining support
4416671 even the most committed greenies occasionally forget to bring their shopping bags with them so there will always be carrier bags available free of charge we want to help our customers remember to reuse their bags rather than punish them when they forget

4416679 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4416680 shes taught me lessons about myself and i feel like ive taught her
4416681 you should have an original wedding song i think its only fitting write down everything you want to say to portia and portia write down everything you want to say to ellen and ill put it to music and it will be amazing
4416682 this is to say that after so much speculation and comments the actors are indeed expecting a baby at the start of next year
4416683 theyve been seeing each other for a couple of months now and winona seems really smitten
4416684 they make a real effort to spend time together and she even dashed back from milan to be with him when the band were performing a concert in washington
4416685 at first i thought i had pants on apparently not
4416686 when it comes to women i just think look at them until they notice you and hope for the best
4416687 i never had any idea how to talk to girls until a year or so ago i still come out with trivial c p when im flirting but i like to think im doing it in a faintly endearing way
4416688 and i would purposely emphasize that by doing odd things
4416689 i wore glasses braces odd hairdos and dumpy clothes i was clumsy and awkward when i was a freshman i wore a christmas tree skirt as a cape i couldnt get any dates until senior year
4416690 i get mad if the maid does all the housework if she takes it all into her own hands well whats for me to do im a cleaning fanatic dusting is my favorite and windex ing

4416693 im writing every day right here at the piano in this living room this is my best work ever
4416694 unfortunately not everything has gone as expected as shes had many other things on her mind on top of all the stress she twisted her ankle over the weekend
4416695 she views this as a sign she should postpone the birthday bash and play it by ear instead

4416700 we have to ask ourselves three questions first what are the precedents secondly did the actors in the precedents believe that they were bound by a rule and thirdly is there a reason for the rule a single precedent with a good reason may be enough to establish the rule a whole string of precedents without such a reason will be of no avail unless it is perfectly certain that the persons concerned regarded them as bound by it
4416701 whilst therefore i am quite clear that it would be wrong and indeed dangerous for any president to act on the mandate of any political party in or outside the house i am equally emphatic that circumstanced as india is a situation might arise when in the larger interest of the country the president of the assembly might feel called upon to tender his resignation with a view to a return to a position of greater freedom i have no doubt in my mind that such a situation has now arisen in the country
4416702 i have come to the conclusion that under the new conditions my usefulness as president has ceased to exist and i should be serving the interest of my country better at this juncture by giving my open and active support to the congress movement and endeavouring to the best of my capacity to keep on which pandit jawaharlal nehru the president of the congress was arrested and sentenced
4416703 i think we are both depressed at how boring we really are and how unexciting even the worse fabrications and exaggerations are when you read about them
4416704 none of it seems very rock and roll so we find it a little sad when there are probably better stories that could be written about both us and the industry medium no sharks groupies or pounds of coke or anything fun at all we read like angry dorks which might be true but is certainly not very exciting
4416705 this is a fantastic opportunity and i am really looking forward to embracing laras world
4416706 i cant wait to get stuck in this is my dream job i have always wanted to be an action hero and hope to be able to use my gymnastic ability to perform all of laras stunts it is slightly daunting but i am really excited at the same time

4416739 i know how much each one of you is concerned about the recent rise in prices we are taking determined measures to bring prices under reasonable control
4416740 our economy must grow at the rate of at least 10 per cent every year to get rid of poverty and generate employment for all
4416741 after almost a decade of stagnation especially from 1998 to 2004 investment in agriculture is increasing and there has been a revival in this area
4416742 we have gone beyond the recommendations of pay commission in increasing emoluments of employees

4416753 i cant really control who the starting five are the only thing i can control is how i play if i come out and play my game do what im asked to do then hopefully im in the lineup
4416754 i dont know for sure that josh sittons the no 1 right guard im not going to say that hes competing like everybody else for a job
4416755 but if you look back two years ago i dont want to say we were in a desperate situation but it was a little different than were in today there was a sense of urgency that we had to get guys lined up whereas now weve got guys whove played some games at guard
4416756 we just have to see how the whole thing shakes out to be honest with you weve got a little more time to see how this thing unfolds im in no rush were going to let some guys play and see how it shakes out
4416757 my main goal right now is just make the team
4416758 because youre always saying in the back of your head there could be someone better than me there could be someone better than me

4416781 the reality is that enterprises are not frustrated with tape many of its inherent challenges have been addressed through more intelligent automated tape library systems
4416782 they cannot back up all the critical corporate data they need to with tape alone because there is more data to back up than ever before there is less planned downtime during which to complete backups and application owners want more frequent backups and faster restores
4416783 in a society where you cannot even buy cassette tapes any more as they are unreliable and known for getting chewed up in machines why are businesses still using tapes to back up their data
4416784 automated online backup means there is no need to physically move the data offsite which the business is charged to have removed and to bring back
4416785 smartways service provides a repeated revenue stream for its partners which can continually buy more storage when needed
4416786 partners buy aggregated storage from us which they can then distribute to each customer this means they do not have to keep coming to us for more space all the time and they can close deals faster
4416787 there is an attachment with tape which is why it will never die
4416788 it is selling more tapes than it has in a while and therefore is investing in developments around tape
4416789 switching to online backup means that the data does not have to be physically moved however it disregards the telecommunication charge it costs companies to virtually transport the data as with anything in it it is a trade off
4416790 tape still has its place even though other technologies are becoming more prevalent
4416791 the role of tape is changing and companies are increasingly looking to take advantage of the newer disk based technologies such as virtual tape libraries vtl and de duplication
4416792 tape being dead has to be one of the most commonly heard untruths in the market there are always claims that new technologies will eliminate tape from the it market and frankly this is not the case
4416793 tapes will not go away because there is always the need for retention but 2008 is the year for de duplication

4416805 those are things were investigating right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4416806 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4416807 he was pretty blunt but always had something good to say even if it was something someone didnt like on the other side
4416808 i went to bill and i said i hate to do this but i need to borrow some money to bury my father
4416809 he said blaine whatever you need youve got it thats the kind of man bill was he had a deep love for all of his employees and i can say we all had a deep love for him
4416810 as far as being able to go out and do the things he wants to do hes been able to do that
4416811 thats so much better than a number on a scale
4416812 last i heard he can still ride a bike as opposed to being a week or 10 days from dying
4416813 i notice that stress eating is something i do well

4416815 we are travelling to south africa with president robert mugabe today as the negotiations continue
4416816 you have tsvangirais backers who are playing hardball and insisting on the virtual disappearance of robert mugabe and youve got robert mugabes backers insisting he remains maintains some kind of executive powers
4416817 we cannot continue wandering around without direction hence the need to swear in parliamentarians and open the house so that the elected members can continue to fulfil their constitutional mandate
4416818 these are the actions of a desperate and cornered regime
4416819 man k nnte sagen ich bin der dieter bohlen von prosieben nur ehrlicher authentischer
4416820 klar werden viele in meinem business berrascht sein dass ich das mache aber ich mache nur sachen die mir spa machen auch wenn ich das letzte f nkchen street credibility dabei verliere so ein schei interessiert mich berhaupt nicht
4416821 ich bin ja nicht einfach zu entertainen aber das hier macht richtig spa

4416829 the 2014 soccer world cup is very very important its the basis for the success of our organization
4416830 we organized the best pan am games ever at the olympics level
4416831 i knew i gave it all i had to give
4416832 it makes it sweeter knowing ive been through injuries and some doubts its definitely been a long journey
4416833 i knew i couldnt because its the olympics and making up six tenths is kind of a dream
4416834 we came back to show that we are the strong team we said we were
4416835 two months before the olympics i made a board with pictures of things that inspire me and my mom hung one of his gold medals on the board
4416836 i knew i gave it all i had to give
4416837 it makes it sweeter knowing ive been through injuries and some doubts its definitely been a long journey
4416838 i knew i couldnt because its the olympics and making up six tenths is kind of a dream
4416839 we came back to show that we are the strong team we said we were
4416840 two months before the olympics i made a board with pictures of things that inspire me and my mom hung one of his gold medals on the board
4416841 in the hardest moment before beam i told her theres nothing to be afraid of
4416842 she hit all her tumbling passes on floor shes a tiger inside i truly believed she was not second i strongly believed her time was coming
4416843 o pacto pela vida n o avan ou no que se refere fundac simplesmente n o andou est travado e o reordenamento precisa ser urgente as a es t m que andar

4416848 i prefer not to play against her because its really hard to play against one of my family
4416849 i dont even want to think about it would be so hard
4416850 its really emotional especially for my parents at home watching it on tv
4416851 sometimes i might make a foul and suddenly realize hey its you
4416852 im married i have university i have work i have everything here i thought it was over
4416853 after one year they called me then they called me again
4416854 i said i dont know let me think let me think after three or fours months i said ok lets try it it was not easy but when i made my decision that was that and im happy
4416855 coming into camp we talked about him as a returner that a lot of people thought could play receiver
4416856 now i think its safe to say that hes a receiver hes doing all the things that weve asked him to do
4416857 peanut is probably one of the best corners in the league because hes very physical
4416858 you know once you go against peanut youre going to have to be prepared to fight
4416859 peanut is an aggressive corner hes going to get his hands on you
4416860 receivers dont like corners getting their hands on someone going against a corner thats real aggressive youve got to step up and play big
4416861 so i have to prepare myself to go a full game the return game and offense i just worked harder
4416862 weve been struggling but have been finding ways to win
4416863 we were down and i knew i had to start being more aggressive
4416864 i dont know what it was but we werent playing well in the first half
4416865 all the hard work paid off all the injuries tears blood rips everything pays off at this very moment
4416866 everything just goes away you can only think of good things now
4416867 we came back and we showed the usa is really strong we deserved the top two medals and we showed the world we can come back no matter what
4416868 im still fighting for that medal count with him he has four so i have a few more to go
4416869 its an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him there on the floor exactly 20 years after he competed
4416870 i honestly didnt know until she finished and the scores came up

4416872 we are truly looking forward to this partnership with century media i am encouraged that they indeed understand the spirit and integrity of loaded this first ep should shed some light on who we are what we do and how the fuck we do it
4416873 its probably more derivative of my earlier years of punk rock its a good rock n roll band its fun is what it is theres no real business and no real drama im really into no drama right now
4416874 he adds noting scott weilands recent rancorous departure from velvet revolver
4416875 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally
4416876 ive been racing peirsol and phelps for 5 or 6 years now and i think im used to getting up and racing them
4416877 in the 200 backstroke i swam as fast as possible but tried not to use my legs as much basically i began racing in the last 50 meters
4416878 before i jumped in i didnt have the suit as tight as i wanted but as soon as i dove in i got bubbled up and i didnt really focus on my suit
4416879 i slept really well and i went to bed like at nine last night
4416880 nutrition is probably the last thing i worry about i eats whatever tastes good ive been eating mcdonalds pretty much every meal here i think it helped though
4416881 i wanted to beat michael phelps every time i got into water and raced him i always feel like i can win thats the way ive been training my mind
4416882 i wanted to defeat phelps but it didnt happen i just got up go back look at the video see what i did wrong and hopefully get better
4416883 i wouldnt have bettered the mark if ryan and others didnt push so hard

4416892 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
4416893 moderation in temper is always a virtue but moderation in principle is always a vice
4416894 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
4416895 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
4416896 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
4416897 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
4416898 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
4416899 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
4416900 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
4416901 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
4416902 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
4416903 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
4416904 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
4416905 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
4416906 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
4416907 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
4416908 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
4416909 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
4416910 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
4416911 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
4416912 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
4416913 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
4416914 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
4416915 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
4416916 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
4416917 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
4416918 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
4416919 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
4416920 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
4416921 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
4416922 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
4416923 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
4416924 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
4416925 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
4416926 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
4416927 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
4416928 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
4416929 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
4416930 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
4416931 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
4416932 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
4416933 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
4416934 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
4416935 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
4416936 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
4416937 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
4416938 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings

4416949 as children hit their teenage years general entertainment sites tend to make way for games focused sites that offer a massive range of easily accessible games ensuring that teenage gaming activity extends far beyond the ps3 wii and xbox consoles
4416950 the internet is very much an entertainment resource for young children mainly due to how well tv broadcasters such as nickelodeon cartoon network the bbc and disney have adapted their traditional offering to the web
4416951 with the launch of grolsch pasture at e4 udderbelly we have strengthened our association with pioneering comedy and increased our presence at arguably the uks leading comedy event of the year

4416953 we are absolutely delighted with this fantastic new association with grolsch particularly as it is such a strong brand and relevant to our comedy audiences

4416962 we are keeping our fingers crossed but there are concerns about him
4416963 well know more about the long term on monday and whether hes going to be fit quickly or be out for a while
4416964 stubbsy has been around the block he knows what he can and cant do and well sit down and have a chat with him
4416965 the sunderland fans dream about playing in europe and we should aim to get there why not
4416966 i think we have a team to finish in the top eight the lads did a good job last year and we have some quality new signings i really think we can do something we just need to believe in ourselves
4416967 this can be a really big club we have a big game on saturday a fantastic game and we can show people what were about and where we want to go
4416968 i would love to do it but if i get an assist for a team mate and we win that is just as good i play for the team and work hard for them
4416969 i think i am a good technical player and i will be suited to the speed and physical side of the game in england
4416970 i am also still fit because i was doing pre season training with deportivo and i cant wait to get started
4416971 im very excited to be here and it is a dream to play for such a big club in the premier league
4416972 i have known about newcastles interest for a while and i wanted to sign because it is a club i know all about from my time watching english football in spain and argentina
4416973 ive told the players they can forget about the top six lets go out there and play some good rugby league
4416974 i just want us to play well i dont want people to remember wakefield trinity wildcats 2008 season for finishing it in poor fashion because for two thirds of it weve had an absolute wow of a season
4416975 we were in genuine top six contention and got to the semi finals of the cup and i dont want them to remember the last third when we just disintegrated
4416976 i want us to finish the season playing some good rugby league if we pick up a couple of wins then marvellous and if it affects the top six even better but i dont think it will when you look at who bradford have got to play
4416977 we the stanford superstars selection panel believe this squad is very capable of doing justice to their selection to the stanford superstars squad to face england for the unprecedented purse
4416978 there are several familiar faces in this stanford superstars squad but there are some exciting new additions such as lindon james lionel baker and chad hampson
4416979 pedro is the type of midfielder who controls a game he never hides he likes to get on the ball he looks for possession and he never wastes it either he has great awareness he makes the team tick
4416980 he isnt a prolific scorer but he has got a great shot and when he scores it is usually from about 20 to 25 yards out
4416981 my advice if you want your baby not to look like joe camel and get to bed on time turn it over to the nannies in your graphics department they have been better trained for the job and they can do it better and faster

4416998 developments in the region including the crisis in zimbabwe and food insecurity can have devastating effects on the lives of women
4416999 governments serious about development democracy and the fight against hiv in southern africa should adopt and implement the gender protocol with the necessary amendments
4417000 domestic violence including marital rape puts women at increased risk of hiv infection and seriously undermines their ability to get effective treatment
4417001 southern african heads of state should commit to preventing and punishing domestic violence and to gender equality if they are serious about curbing the spread of hiv
4417002 op mijn twaalfde luisterde ik al naar de scanner waarmee je de politie en brandweer kon horen communiceren
4417003 er was een brand bij het station een verslaggever van het nieuwsblad vroeg me of hij de foto die ik had gemaakt mocht gebruiken mijn eerste 150 gulden was binnen ik was best trots
4417004 als ik aan het werk was kon ik natuurlijk niet achter het nieuws aan en als ik s nachts op pad was geweest en ik moest de volgende ochtend aan het werk probeerde ik s ochtends snel een dienst te ruilen
4417005 het gaat erg goed we hebben zon 15 000 bezoekers per dag opdrachtgevers zijn onder meer sbs6 rtv noord dagblad van het noorden met de site 112 nederland dekken we al 70 procent van het land
4417006 ik beschouw mezelf wel als journalist ik verkoop beeldmateriaal dat ik zelf verzamel het is een mooi vak erg afwisselen en vol snelheid
4417007 het lijkt erop dat n of twee mensen verantwoordelijk zijn voor deze serie auto inbraken
4417008 soms is er ook niets gestolen uit opengebroken autos dat is heel vreemd het is de rovers niet om de autos te doen want die steken ze na een diefstal in brand
4417009 estamos ante un gobierno agotado y antiguo con un rea econ mica claramente superada y con un presidente desorientado
4417010 el rea econ mica del gobierno ha estado parada y adem s ha estado en disputa constante as es imposible generar confianza alguna
4417011 incapaz de fijar prioridades y tomar decisiones para abordar una crisis econ mica galopante
4417012 es un gobierno antiguo que adem s est dividido muy desorientado y que no sabe qu hacer enfatiz es sorprendente pero en cuatro meses lo que est transmitiendo es agotamiento y est generando mucha desconfianza en el conjunto de la sociedad espa ola que necesita un mensaje de esperanza y que le diga que se va a salir de la crisis pero para eso hay que tomar medidas y gobernar
4417013 el pp ha ofrecido su colaboraci n al gobierno pero es muy dif cil colaborar con quien no quiere hacerlo lo que s creo que tiene sentido es que acepte la petici n de colaboraci n que le ha hecho la oposici n manifest
4417014 plantearemos el debate una a una para que el gobierno diga por qu no las acepta pero desde luego la oposici n ha cumplido con su obligaci n ha hecho propuestas y adem s le ha ofrecido colaboraci n en este asunto
4417015 un capit n que no sabe lo que tiene entre manos
4417016 en este momento tocan esas medidas que habr a que hacerlas por decreto ley y urgentemente
4417017 es absolutamente ineficiente desde el punto de vista econ mico
4417018 estoy convencido de que de esta crisis vamos a salir pero si no se toman medidas saldremos m s tarde y con m s da o
4417019 no tiene sentido decir que va a regalar 49 millones de bombillas
4417020 es un absurdo y el gobierno debe tomarse las cosas en serio si quiere de verdad transmitir confianza y generar credibilidad indic

4417022 we always tried to make games that anyone could pick up and play they may over time reveal a lot of structural and mechanical complexity but the first mission of more or less any rockstar game is very easy and engaging for a reason because new people playing the game have to be gently led into the world of 3d action games or open world racing games or whatever
4417023 this is the way we try to cater for a mass market

4417041 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico

4417053 the most important service we can give our brothers and sisters is the clear and humble proclamation of jesus christ who came to this world that we might have life and have it in abundance
4417054 amidst the difficulties of a sometimes hostile environment from the lack of immediate and spectacular results or faced with the insufficiency of human means i invite you not to be overcome by fear weighed down by discouragement or dragged along by inertia
4417055 the present time is a providential occasion for listening again with simplicity purity of heart and fidelity to how christ reminds us that we are not servants but friends
4417056 he instructs us in order that we might remain in his love without molding ourselves to the messages of this world let us not be deaf to his word let us learn from him let us imitate his way of life let us be sowers of the word in this way with all of our lives with the joy of knowing we are loved by jesus who we can call brother we will be valid instruments for him to continue drawing everyone to himself with the mercy that flows from his cross
4417057 to share this treasure with others as there is no greater treasure than to enjoy the friendship of christ and walk by his side consecrating our greatest energies to this beautiful labor is worth it knowing that divine grace precedes sustains and accompanies us in carrying it out
4417058 may you find therefore in persevering prayer in the fervent meditation of the word of god in the obedience to the magisterium of the church in the dignified celebration of the sacraments and in the testimony of fraternal charity the strength necessary to identify with the sentiments of christ you will be his disciples with coherence and generosity proclaiming with your own examples that christ is the son of god the redeemer of man and the firm rock upon which we cement our existence
4417059 the consolation of christ and to offer his love to those in tribulation to those who are weighed down by suffering and have been wounded by the coldness of indifferentism or the scourge of corruption these challenges demand we overcome individualism and isolation and that we strengthen the sense of belonging to the church and the loyal collaboration with her pastors in order to form christian communities that are prayerful unified fraternal and missionary
4417060 blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb and why has this happened to me that the mother of my lord comes to me for as soon as i heard the sound of your greeting the child in my womb leaped for joy and blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her by the lord
4417061 my soul magnifies the lord and my spirit rejoices in god my savior for he has looked with favor on the lowliness of his servant surely from now on all generations will call me blessed or the mighty one has done great things for me and holy is his name his mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation he has shown strength with his arm he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts he has brought down the powerful from their thrones and lifted up the lowly he has filled the hungry with good things and sent the rich away empty he has helped his servant israel in remembrance of his mercy according to the promise he made to our ancestors to abraham and to his descendants forever
4417062 30 year history of advocating and acting in support of legalized abortion
4417063 there are many goods you are trying to weigh where you have someone in public life who is not living in their public responsibilities consistent with the catholic faith i think you are concerned about that individual
4417064 one of the things that i said when i met with the governor at one point is that some day shes going to have to stand before god and account for her public service and i hope that shes going to have something better to say than what she does to this point on the protection of the innocent unborn but i said if you go to god and you say well i didnt understand how important this was or i didnt understand that this was such a crucial issue then as your bishop im the one responsible because i didnt do enough to try and make sure of that i told her i wasnt comfortable with that and so i wanted to make sure that she understood what a serious matter this was
4417065 i think you have concern for that individual and in wanting to try to bring about enlightenment and conversion you also have a concern for the rest of your people thats the problem with the individual thats in a public position when they act contradictory to their faith then it can create within the church what the church means by scandal which means leading others into error
4417066 frankly after the pastoral action i did take with the governor
4417067 there were several people who communicated with me that we didnt realize how extreme she was
4417068 i also am concerned about young catholics that are thinking about public service and public life
4417069 they cant go the road of these so called pro choice catholic politicians and really be faithful to your faith
4417070 to my mind you have to pursue it in that way you have to attempt to meet with the individual instruct the individual make sure that youve given them every chance to consider their position before you take extreme action
4417071 to my knowledge she hasnt gone to communion since this second request to her so in that sense from an indirect way shes honoring the request
4417072 she has not communicated with me at this point at all and shes told other people in the media that shes going to respond to me personally but that hasnt happened at this time
4417073 what i found out after i took the pastoral action with governor sebelius is that senator obama had her on his advisory committee for catholics
4417074 but i hope that it alerted senator obama that this is not probably somebody that can really counsel you in terms of the mind and the heart of the church on this very critical and important area
4417075 so i think it would be a bad judgment on senator obamas part to select someone who was in conflict with the church
4417076 we can have a serious impact on the positions that the individuals and parties are taking
4417077 i think that the political parties read the results of the election and then put an interpretation on it after this election theyre either going to think we need to be more aware of these values about the sanctity of human life the importance of marriage and its traditional understanding being upheld or theyre going to think these are things we can either ignore or the tide is with us to go against what has really been the tradition of western civilization

4417421 we still see the next few months as being quite rough withthe prospect of more weakness in late september october as theglobal economic downturn feeds into more profit downgrades particularly for cyclical sectors
4417422 this is a supporting factor for the automotive sector aswell as for consumption near industries as consumers feel therelief through lower fuel prices

4417437 the addition of this dramatically designed sport wagon is well synchronized with todays changing consumer tastes as a compelling alternative to suvs or other larger vehicles
4417438 this is an important step in cadillacs ongoing global expansion and of course in international markets like europe wagons have been and continue to be very significant
4417439 the cts sport wagon is an important expansion to the cadillac lineup worldwide
4417440 its a taut design that not only suggests sleekness but delivers it
4417441 indeed the drama of the sedan is amplified in the cts sport wagon as the centerline cue that is part of the exterior and interior is more prominent and plays a stronger role in defining the design at the rear of the vehicle
4417442 the more you study the rear of the cts sport wagon the more you see
4417443 functionality was certainly a guiding factor during development but so was the idea to inject emotion into the normally sedate wagon category
4417444 theyre not fins in the classic sense but they work to help disguise the cargo load system and yes they acknowledge cadillacs design heritage

4417458 this is going to be an excellent thing for the industry
4417459 this initiative already has the momentum to make real changes
4417460 as paul hirsch said in our interview aihsp is not a small group of people exercising dominance over the industry we are creating a system in which the industry as a whole can decide for itself how much mutual support it wants to bestow upon itself aihsps objective is inclusion rather than policing from above it is intent on making the industry reflect inwardly as a result there should be no detractors i believe this initiative will be pivotal

4417467 my soul proclaims the greatness of the lord my spirit rejoices in god my savior for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant from this day all generations will call me blessed the almighty has done great things for me and holy is his name he has mercy on those who fear him in every generation he has shown the strength of his arm and has scattered the proud in their conceit he has cast down the mighty from their thrones and has lifted up the lowly he has filled the hungry with good things and the rich he has sent away empty he has come to the help of his servant israel for he has remembered his promise of mercy the promise he made to our fathers to abraham and his children forever

4417477 we agreed that we were going to have a church service and told the vietnamese and they said no

4417480 we thought look if were going to be together then were going to stand up theyd done so many bad things that we werent nearly as afraid of them as maybe we would have been if a lot of us hadnt gone through what wed gone through
4417481 render unto caesar what is caesars and render unto god what is gods
4417482 what i was trying to tell my fellow prisoners is that we were doing caesars work when we got into prison so we should ask for gods help to do the right thing and for us to get out of prison if it be gods will for us to do so
4417483 the god we had come to know wasnt going to wave a magic wand and poof we would all be free the god we knew would give us the strength to endure what we had to do and it was up to us to take that strength and knowledge and do what we had to do
4417484 i recall it as if it happened an hour ago
4417485 it was cold the guards were looking through the windows at us the room was dimly lit because of the light bulbs that were in each corner these guys had beautiful voices im telling you one was a bass one was a tenor it was one of the most beautiful experiences i ever had
4417486 it was because they were so happy to be able to celebrate christmas with fellow americans
4417487 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president

4417503 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defense system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4417504 i consider that the united states is not acting in a cautious manner in this situation
4417505 instead of getting full moral and political support in the struggle against real aggression and ethnic cleansing we have heard a mass of unpleasant words and threats that will of course not strengthen our relations

4417512 i got in late last night off the ferry figured this was as good a poach spot as any there were some dogs running around but they left me alone
4417513 it was in the early months of 1996 that i had the unbearable feeling that i had to change my life

4417526 first remember trout are not native to patagonia so they have no predators so no fears of exposure but more importantly when all your food comes from the bank it doesnt matter how deep or broad the water is the dominant trout will put himself next to the most possible amount of bank so if the river is just one meter wide he has two sides for food to come from
4417527 so do you use bigger and bigger hopper flies as the summer progresses to match the growth of the naturals

4417549 the dnc certified the entire kentucky delegation and we are focused on going to denver and electing senator barack obama as our nominee
4417550 this year more than ever it is important to be unified as democrats and we are ready to work hard to elect senator obama to the white house
4417551 as a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests

4417562 if thats pressure then after years in law enforcement how do they do their job if thats perceived as pressure
4417563 we dont ignore complaints but if its the same one with no new evidence then i have to tell people that theres nothing new here
4417564 obviously thats going to be a point of contention and steve branchflower is conducting an investigation that may turn up evidence that illuminates that issue
4417565 the thing its going to come down to is whether you have clear evidence that what was motivating them was a bad reason the administration is totally free to get rid of bad troopers as long as the reason them thinking hes bad is related to his recent job performance but if what theyre doing is trying to call him out because of the divorce or allegations from long ago then i think youre probably breaking the personnel laws
4417566 its already yielding results hes already had a couple of folks contact him one named and one unnamed
4417567 sarah palin did come in to office talking about sort of doing the right thing its pretty clear i think on the face of it that some of the people there at least didnt get the message because trying to pressure people into firing classified employees is not the right thing

4417589 it is over three weeks since we learned that the portuguese authorities had closed the investigation to find madeleine lifted our arguido status and ended judicial secrecy
4417590 we were surprised that copies of investigation files were given to the media the content of these files has been extensively reported it will be clear to everyone now that there is absolutely no evidence that suggests madeleine has been seriously harmed
4417591 knowing this we strongly believe that madeleine is out there and can be found of course whoever is responsible for madeleines abduction must and can be found to prevent them from putting another child and family through the misery we have suffered
4417592 it helps the outlook for inflation its also going to help if we have a higher dollar

4417605 the uci has been one of the leading international federations in the fight against doping which is not the case of some bigger federations
4417606 i dont believe you should punish a sport because it is finding cheats
4417607 the best way to support a sport that has a doping problem is not to throw it out but rather to help it
4417608 we hope we will be able to help the sport of cycling we hope that olympic cycling will be a cleaner sport than cycling in general is today
4417609 look at how many times our swimmers have been tested i assure you that this is a clean team

4417617 tras la eurocopa siento el reconocimiento de la gente y eso me pone muy contento y feliz pero como ya dije yo sigo siendo el de siempre y no ha cambiado nada
4417618 lo nico que nos falta y por lo que quiero luchar por lograrlo es un t tulo
4417619 emily needs some more work but her bone structure and her body is amazing i do love marisa too but then there is jane who is gorgeous
4417620 he really carried himself well emily has a great editorial look and could carry off a number of different looks
4417621 it was very very tough everyone had their own plus points
4417622 everyone was a really strong contender im so impressed by the standard east coast is so much better in terms of looks
4417623 i didnt expect it at all i loved the show loved the catwalk but thought that was it i am just overwhelmed
4417624 i feel amazing ive done no modelling before its so overwhelming my little boy dylan is so happy
4417625 it was pretty overwhelming to see them all up on stage what a great achievement
4417626 from the schools perspective leiths involvement has helped a lot
4417627 my coming here to study was facilitated by the same links
4417628 when i joined we had very little and now we have pigs sheep cows and chickens and it is self sufficient with 750 girls attending
4417629 the idea from the start was to make the school self sufficient and the borehole is pretty much the final and crucial part of that
4417630 the school was originally intended for 450 and now is up to more than 700 and there has never been a proper water supply
4417631 we agreed to donate money to help provide a borehole and other equipment to try and make the school completely self sufficient which would allow it to keep fees as low as possible
4417632 the outdoor environment can greatly affect the health of people with copd and this programme allows us to provide these patients with detailed information that will help them stay well
4417633 initial patient feedback has proved very positive highlighting an improved quality of life for many patients with copd and a reduced risk of unplanned medical contact such as emergency hospital admissions
4417634 we are delighted to be able to offer this programme as part of our anticipatory care service
4417635 i am pleased that we can offer this unique service to our patients this pilot demonstrated yet another healthcare innovation being offered to patients in east lothian
4417636 being aware of detrimental weather conditions enables people to plan ahead and avoid situations that could aggravate their condition
4417637 it is always disappointing to hear about job losses in west lothian we understand that livingston will be affected by hbos plans to cut around 400 jobs in the uk
4417638 we have not yet received notification of local redundancies we will be seeking a meeting with hbos to discuss their plans and to see what assistance support and advice we can offer to local employees
4417639 were going to be doing a lot of grant applications and well hope to have more days like this fair throughout the year
4417640 id been living in canada for years beside a really nice park and i thought why dont we have a park like that weve got the space for it i spoke to people and found there was a lot of support
4417641 local people are very fond of the park and i just think it will change the atmosphere the play equipment thats there at the moment is old but its well used
4417642 theres been a superb response from locals and weve had amazing donations from local businesses as well the main purpose of the event is to raise awareness for what friends of montgomery park is doing
4417643 triggered by your interest in images of child pornography you forcibly abused two girls in a wholly disgraceful manner you appear to have no or very little insight into the nature and consequences of your conduct nor have you shown remorse or regret
4417644 i killed him it was me it was my fault
4417645 this case has resulted in the loss of a young life and the death of a friend
4417646 it is an example of the devastation drugs can cause
4417647 he went on and on and on and on about taking smack
4417648 these proposals are something which the club believes will not only help take it forward but will also be a huge benefit to the local community
4417649 we are a community club and the facilities we have at the moment are simply not good enough
4417650 if we were able to develop a new stand and new changing facilities it would help us to get into the sfa and that would mean entry to the scottish cup and the associated financial benefits
4417651 more than that however is the pride which local youngsters would be able to take in their club so instead of destroying the facilities they would be encouraged to take part in the club
4417652 there is a willingness to see the clubs long term future secured and as such council officers should continue to engage with club officials to identify a possible acceptable alternative
4417653 just as last year we moved from combat to overwatch we would expect a further change in the first months of 2009
4417654 although it is hoped that the uk military presence in iraq will decrease significantly in the future it is still too early to discuss the size and shape of a reduced uk forces footprint
4417655 nach getisch hattisch altdravidisch urart isch tschagataisch und dem klassischen guaran nach guantschisch und elamisch kazukuru guliguli und oskisch das schon im zuge der eroberung kampaniens durch die r mer und die unterwerfung der osken zwischen 370 und 290 vor christi ausgerottet wurde warnt die weltbr ckenschutzkommission unesco
4417656 the businessman made his money and moved to spain to live the good life our family still want justice for neil i dont know if its possible but i would love to see him in the dock
4417657 we always thought that the men who killed neil were after charlie and got the wrong man now it turns out they mightve been after john
4417658 i cant say if thats true but it may make something happen in the case
4417659 im speaking to the police next week so they might be able to tell us more we just want to know whats going on
4417660 neil was the apple of my mums eye she closed down completely when he died
4417661 it broke her heart and she never got over it she died ten years afterwards but i honestly believe it killed her
4417662 there have been suggestions that neil was involved in the underworld but thats rubbish which anyone who knew him would tell you neil never bothered anyone he only went out that night because he wanted a game of darts
4417663 neil knew charlie from school and they just met by accident in the international bar that night neil hadnt planned to meet him
4417664 weve never had any closure over what happened to neil
4417665 it really doesnt hurt at all sometimes when i go home at night i might feel a bit of pain but not during the act
4417666 the only time it hurts is when it comes out unplanned like if im bending down to pick up a suitcase and it pops out
4417667 we are happy to look at applications for events at the park but there are a lot of strict rules which may be why we receive few requests
4417668 offering a tantalising taste of malaysias delicious cuisine sun drenched beaches and rich cultural heritage and with a wealth of exciting activities to keep everyone entertained the malaysia pavilion is a unique opportunity to explore the best of malaysia
4417669 the second wave of energy price rises has put the final nail in the coffin for affordable energy news of the governments 150 one off rebate for families on child benefit will provide respite for some households but for others it will be a drop in the ocean
4417670 it is not yet possible to describe a full range of alternatives as full discussion has not yet been possible with all interested retailers our main approach to this issue should be to have working relationships with retailers that allow us to offer access to a range of shopping services
4417671 it must be some kind of ghost meter as we have not seen it and we have no idea where they suddenly got this from
4417672 initially when we contacted them to say there had been some kind of mistake they wouldnt give us a reason but just kept saying that was our bill and we had to pay it
4417673 when we pressed them they said there was another meter on site they hadnt been charging
4417674 most of the time when they have come to check the meter there has been no one at the club so a lot of our bills have just been estimated readings
4417675 i do not understand how there can be another meter that they have not been billing us for and we really want to get this sorted out
4417676 we are currently investigating what caused this delay and are working with the club to arrive at a solution
4417677 i had a message from another member of the family to say they are hurt but its nothing but cuts and bruises theyre absolutely fine
4417678 his parents his sister and his brother were on the great wall sightseeing and it started raining
4417679 they took shelter in a tower on the wall which was then struck by lightning there were no serious injuries but they have been taken to a clinic as a precautionary measure
4417680 george was very confident hes pretty level headed and david is too and his coach mark delaney had coached him very well but david will always have a wee chat with his dad as well to give him a bit of extra reassurance
4417681 im very concerned about the massive reduction in hours its asking a bit much for people in these communities to only have a service for two hours a week
4417682 this shouldnt be a purely economic decision a post office in a rural area is not necessarily going to have the same number of customers as a larger town but its still an essential part of the community
4417683 its a unique post office based in a village shed at the bottom of the garden it creates some social link for the whole of the village the pub has already closed and were in danger of just becoming a row of commuter houses
4417684 the nearest one is three miles away in east linton and the bus service isnt very regular
4417685 were not going to take this lying down this is going to affect a large number of people especially the elderly and young families
4417686 not everyone has a car and people rely on being able to walk down to the local post office
4417687 theres a very strong sense of community here and the post office is definitely part of it its unfortunate to see another business disappear from leith walk
4417688 i find this extremely sad its a very small village and apart from dalmeny primary theres almost nothing there its not very easy for older people to get the bus into queensferry
4417689 i came in about 10 15pm and there were police officers outside saying there have been three terror arrests
4417690 its really worrying that its so close its like oh my god who is it you cant believe its actually happening on your street
4417691 this has had no effect on the airport it is a total police operation and we didnt even know that it had happened until afterwards
4417692 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity
4417693 the trader currently occupies a greater area than has been applied for this creates an unreasonable obstruction to pedestrians using the north pavement of princes street
4417694 to enhance the look of the stall i display flowers at the foot of my stall on doing so this does take me over the applied measurement
4417695 my solution to this objection is to change the measurement on my application to incorporate the flowers and buckets on the ground
4417696 breakthroughs in identifying genetic mutations that are responsible for causing pagets disease have now made it possible for genetic testing to be carried out via a simple blood test
4417697 if the people who are likely to develop pagets later in life can be identified in middle age there is a chance to stop the disease in its tracks
4417698 we are encouraged that just four months into the scheme so many gps are participating there is little doubt the public back extended opening hours and i would urge those gp practices still to enter the scheme to get involved increased resources have been made available for extended hours and this money remains available
4417699 it is not going to improve the health of scotland because it is the same people who come during the day they just come more
4417700 jump also tried to issue a summary of information to the planning committee prior to their embarkation on to the bus from the city chambers this had also been unsuccessful as despite being given one set of information by council staff departure plans were not as to information provided
4417701 the made in scotland showcase will be a fantastic shop window for scottish based performing artists
4417702 during the festivals we attract culture lovers from around the world and the expo fund is a great opportunity to show what fantastic performers we have right here in scotland
4417703 made in scotland will allow talented artists who may not have otherwise been able to perform to bring their most ambitious work to the fringe
4417704 the fringe can open up a whole host of opportunities and for scottish artists its on their very doorstep
4417705 made in scotland will provide financial and developmental support so scottish dance and theatre artists can present their work in the best possible way at the fringe and open up other touring opportunities
4417706 we are very grateful to the scottish government for their generous support of this innovative new programme through the expo fund
4417707 the fringe has already had one crisis with the box office situation this year and if we lose the assembly rooms the council will precipitate another one
4417708 bill should stop claiming the end of the world is nigh
4417709 we have sent out a note to all gps with advice on the health risks associated with flooding
4417710 risks to the public are very low although flood waters may be contaminated with sewage or other waste any harmful bugs in the water are usually only present in small quantities
4417711 if you have to be in contact with flood water for instance when clearing up please ensure you protect any open cuts or wounds and wear protective clothing waterproof boots and gloves after cleaning up please make sure you wash your hands rigorously
4417712 floodwater contaminated toys should be washed with hot water and detergent or disinfected before being given back to children for use
4417713 id walk through hell in a gasoline suit to play baseball

4417717 america needs leadership when it comes to energy and ethanol is particularly part of that future
4417718 this is a great news source which i look forward to reading every day
4417719 local government in south africa including the city of johannesburg is committed to ensuring that all those who live within its jurisdiction and abide by its laws have a decent quality of life
4417720 this should be so in spite of limited financial resources and sometimes even a limited management capacity
4417721 the city has embarked on a mixed income housing programme to ensure integrated and inclusive human settlements by the year 2011 the city would have built 50 000 houses for mixed income groups
4417722 in our research we have found that those international migrants are typically better educated and are likely to generate jobs for south africans
4417723 if we are to build an inclusive and prosperous city we must rethink how we engage with populations
4417724 jennifer granholm has driven what should be a great state down the tubes
4417725 if we do that we will have casperson and mccain
4417726 this is a great news source which i look forward to reading every day
4417727 we have water sunshine we even have an active volcano we have more energy than we need for our development
4417728 we will be fighting 100 percent against co2 at the same date that you the g8 rich nations will be at 50 percent
4417729 this is a great news source which i look forward to reading every day

4417732 this is a great news source which i look forward to reading every day
4417733 in any given one year period 9 5 percent of the population or about 18 8 million american adults suffer from a depressive illness
4417734 i see it all the time its probably the most undertreated illness in the u s
4417735 this is explained by low energy lack of motivation an i dont care attitude
4417736 spend a tremendous amount of energy trying to control their moods which leaves them depleted and without energy to do the simplest tasks
4417737 i see a lot of people in your shoes and they do feel better after treatment i dont see anything so different about you to see that youre a basket case or hopeless
4417738 is not the same as a passing blue mood it is not a sign of personal weakness or a condition that can be willed or wished away without treatment symptoms can last for weeks months or years
4417739 some people would say it is natural following certain traumatic stressful events such as the loss of a spouse or loved one in fact the loss of a spouse is the environmental stressor most often associated with the onset of an episode of severe depression
4417740 these persons thought it was natural to feel depressed in this situation it is natural to grieve the loss of a loved one but severe depression is never normal
4417741 talking about it can bring some relief and at the same time somebody else can recognize the need for professional help
4417742 healthy elderly people are not depressed and they are able to enjoy life fully
4417743 most of the depressed people who complete suicide expressed suicidal thoughts prior to their death
4417744 at times depression is situational triggered by certain external events
4417745 there never seems to be a time that we are able to let ourselves go and just be at peace without a schedule and to do list
4417746 one thing is for sure we have to keep an eye on this
4417747 because its there because it could develop into something stronger and if it follows what the models are saying it will be in our vicinity over the weekend
4417748 several of our guidance models would like to make it a hurricane
4417749 as soon as we have a depression or a tropical storm the computer models will behave more accurately
4417750 anytime you have a disturbance like this one in the atlantic in august headed this way you have to monitor it very carefully
4417751 they do their best but theres always another book coming out and i want to make sure that mine gets the attention it deserves before they move on to the next one
4417752 was extremely cooperative when i came up with the idea of including an audio cd
4417753 from the ceo on down theyre totally behind my books in fact the marketing director is a fan
4417754 i paid for my web site josephfinder com hired someone to design it and someone else to run it its impossible to gauge but i see more and more response from reviewers journalists and booksellers and readers communicate with me too
4417755 everyone likes to get inside information and have a connection
4417756 im basically a shy person but also i dont want to miss anything if im out on the road plus i dont like to go anyplace where they only speak one language and dont have cuban coffee
4417757 is it in their catalog and if so how does it compare to other books is there a two page spread is there a large print run a big advance a tour have they sent out galleys to reviewers
4417758 they should at least be able to secure reviews from the big four trade publications publishers weekly kirkus reviews booklist and library journal too
4417759 the savvy authors guide to book publicity a comprehensive resource from building the buzz to pitching the press
4417760 some authors may initiate their own campaigns often with the knowledge and blessings of their publisher but sometimes without
4417761 meet you in hell andrew carnegie henry clay frick and the bitter partnership that transformed america
4417762 the plain fact is that in an industry where 25 000 is a substantial advance after your agents commission taxes and a little money to live on how much is left my publishers have always been collaborative and like to see me tour and do signings but do you know how many books you usually sell at a signing
4417763 so if you do a 10 city tour with average expense of a thousand dollars a day how much does that work out to be per copy
4417764 but the publisher thinks its worth it and that it helps with word of mouth which is how most books sell anyway im fine with that because its the most valuable and effective thing i can do to help sell my books
4417765 that would be more of a business course id imagine but we do cover how to present material to an agent which is an important step in the process
4417766 publishers know that in addition to getting a book theyre getting me
4417767 im out there meeting with people at schools organizations and other places that make sense
4417768 when that happens publishers have to make sure that there are books in shops to capitalize on it
4417769 the unspoken truth is that except for perhaps 250 giant books every year out of 75 000 published the publisher is expecting the author to do 100 percent of the sales and promotion because authors dont understand that they end up bitter angry and perhaps destitute
4417770 the most successful authors drive from store to store in a sort of perma tour selling books out of the back of their car or just working with individual stores to make their titles stand out
4417771 oliver north made hundreds of thousands of dollars selling his remaindered autobiography at speeches to right wing groups this approach is antediluvian and time consuming but it works
4417772 once we hammer out a plan they do a terrific job in supporting it there are other publishers who are far more conservative far more certain that the tried and true is the only path the problem with that approach is that it is wrong
4417773 i dont flog the blog that hard which certainly costs me short term book sales but thats ok because the point is to keep the ideas moving around i think its pretty safe to say that the investment in the blog has certainly paid off in increased book sales over time
4417774 you need a platform to make a published book work if you dont have a platform yet you should self publish your first book and give away enough copies to get a platform and then use that platform to engage your readers so that you can sell the second one to a publisher and quit your day job
4417775 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4417776 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4417777 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4417778 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4417779 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4417780 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4417781 this is for all those people who have given us this independence day we are doing this for the people to feel patriotic

4417805 ive done a lot to promote and change the way messages are relayed to our children and our families over the last few years promoting positive content and positive messages is so important to educate and preserve the next generation being exposed to positive content is what changed my life i believe that there is a market in our community for a new diverse network that provides a new brand of superior programming that caters to all aspects of television from reality to original programming in addition im excited to be able to expose the urban community to a vast array of jobs in the entertainment community that they might not otherwise be privy to i have a great relationship with bet and mtv and my son and i will continue to do work with them and support their networks with bbtv were spearheading the initiative to meet consumer demand for family friendly hip hop content

4417849 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4417850 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state

4417853 the floods we experienced last year caused untold misery both emotional and financial for hundreds of families and the council and other government agencies must make sure this never happens again
4417854 our requests are simple erect flood defences where the rivers broke their banks dredge the rivers and clear them of rubbish on a regular basis
4417855 it is vital that we join together to ensure that flood prevention remains high on the councils agenda and at the forefront of peoples minds across the region

4417862 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4417863 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4417864 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4417865 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4417866 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4417878 i would ask all climbers out there to remember ben cheek and the men who were killed on k2

4417893 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4417894 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4417895 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4417896 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4417897 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4417898 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4417899 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4417900 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4417901 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4417902 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4417903 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4417904 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4417905 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4417906 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4417907 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4417908 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4417909 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4417910 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4417911 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4417912 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4417913 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4417914 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4417915 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4417916 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4417917 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4417918 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4417919 6 de las 26 recesiones segu an sin ser detectadas
4417920 de qu sirve un hombre del tiempo que nunca anuncia lluvia hasta que tanto t como l pod is mirar a trav s de la ventana y ver que est de hecho lloviendo

4417924 por supuesto es deseable una cierta cautela al revisar los pron sticos econ micos
4417925 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4417926 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4417927 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4417928 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4417929 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4417930 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4417931 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4417932 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4417933 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4417934 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4417935 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4417936 ahora estoy en el villarreal y muy centrado y muy contento de seguir aqu

4417938 este verano parece que se han dicho muchas cosas pero por mi cabeza no pasa otra que jugar aqu en el villarreal que es mi equipo estoy muy a gusto y es mi casa
4417939 a m no me ha llamado nadie ni me ha interesado tampoco este es un equipo que esta creciendo mucho va bien en la liga esta en la liga de campeones y aspira a m s
4417940 tras la eurocopa siento el reconocimiento de la gente y eso me pone muy contento y feliz pero como ya dije yo sigo siendo el de siempre y no ha cambiado nada
4417941 lo nico que nos falta y por lo que quiero luchar por lograrlo es un titulo
4417942 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4417943 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4417944 estamos ante un gobierno agotado y antiguo con un rea econ mica claramente superada y con un presidente desorientado
4417945 el rea econ mica del gobierno ha estado parada y adem s ha estado en disputa constante as es imposible generar confianza alguna
4417946 incapaz de fijar prioridades y tomar decisiones para abordar una crisis econ mica galopante
4417947 es un gobierno antiguo que adem s est dividido muy desorientado y que no sabe qu hacer enfatiz es sorprendente pero en cuatro meses lo que est transmitiendo es agotamiento y est generando mucha desconfianza en el conjunto de la sociedad espa ola que necesita un mensaje de esperanza y que le diga que se va a salir de la crisis pero para eso hay que tomar medidas y gobernar
4417948 el pp ha ofrecido su colaboraci n al gobierno pero es muy dif cil colaborar con quien no quiere hacerlo lo que s creo que tiene sentido es que acepte la petici n de colaboraci n que le ha hecho la oposici n manifest
4417949 plantearemos el debate una a una para que el gobierno diga por qu no las acepta pero desde luego la oposici n ha cumplido con su obligaci n ha hecho propuestas y adem s le ha ofrecido colaboraci n en este asunto
4417950 un capit n que no sabe lo que tiene entre manos
4417951 en este momento tocan esas medidas que habr a que hacerlas por decreto ley y urgentemente
4417952 es absolutamente ineficiente desde el punto de vista econ mico
4417953 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4417954 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4417955 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4417956 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4417957 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4417958 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4417959 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4417960 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4417961 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4417962 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4417963 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4417964 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4417965 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4417966 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4417967 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4417968 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4417969 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4417970 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4417971 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4417972 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4417973 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4417974 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4417975 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4417976 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4417977 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4417978 hippies make me laugh bleeding hippies make me laugh really hard
4417979 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4417980 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4417981 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4417982 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4417983 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4417984 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4417985 the place of network visibility in it operational risk management
4417986 its important to carefully strike a balance with risk management to achieve maximum risk mitigation at minimal cost
4417987 paesslers software enables it organizations to efficiently utilize resources in the planning and execution of a risk mitigation strategy by offering more detailed visibility into critical parts of their networks
4417988 the magicbricks com gurgaon property bazaar 08 saw over 2 500 home seekers walk in to interact with twenty five developers and builders participating in the event business transactions of over rs 12 crore were conducted the participants were not only from delhi and ncr but also from jaipur which gave visitors another reason to visit the fair
4417989 the magicbricks com fair was a good opportunity for me to come and see all the options available in market it made the search for my dream home a lot easier i can now go home and think about all these choices before finally getting to a conclusion without having to visit various places where these builders and developers are actually located magicbricks com fairs have really simplified house hunting
4417990 the large educated and talented pool in gurgaon is slowly being exposed to international quality living we wanted to showcase quality housing and our wide range of facilities that make life more pleasurable and vibrant magicbricks com exhibition in gurgaon has been a stupendous success for us
4417991 the bdi group believes that such kind of professionally organized property fairs are the need of the hour since the real estate boom in india needs to be explored at all possible levels and developers can directly interact with the prospective buyers and magicbricks com gurgaon property fair served this purpose successfully
4417992 we have exchanged out views with the icc panel and in turn we heard what they had to say were a lot more informed now than we were before however the concerns are still there of course there have been lots of things said that are going to be put into place and lets hope those things are put in place to an appropriate level
4417993 the players are only three weeks away from one of the biggest one day tournaments that we play and we still dont know if were going theres obviously some decisions to be made in the next few days and we hope those crucial decisions on pakistan are made in the next few days
4417994 if the four nations were relectant to visit pakistan it was not too late to move the champions trophy to sri lanka we are very short of time now if we are going to shift now it needs to be made within the next few days

4417999 mind you that means human sacrifice next wed better get a move on
4418000 if youre coming with me youll need to keep your strength up
4418001 whats wrong with believing in magic anyway it gives people hope
4418002 you ever notice how every time we gather sparks the air tastes of farts
4418003 yeah well it smells just like this part of the swamp i think that maybe they get blown in from here
4418004 and why now well what better time to look for devilishly elusive glowing things than at night
4418005 but at least we can prove that they are not bloody fairies
4418006 you just said that the sparks could be its nervous system so maybe it is alive
4418007 look i agree with you we dont need this fairy stuff condemning us to living in darkness
4418008 but magic and consoling myths have always had their place in the human heart especially when we dont understand something
4418009 are you saying adults need fairy tales to be happy
4418010 sometimes and sometimes we need them just to make sense of the world
4418011 you just said that here is something we dont understand so all i want to do is what scientists have always done observe enquire experiment
4418012 and at what point does the search for reason become unreasonable
4418013 okay have it your way but if after this anyone dares mention bloody fairies to me again ill come straight back here and puncture me one of these things
4418014 this morn i was awaked by the singing of the birds ashore from whence we are distant not a quarter of a mile the numbers of them were certainly very great their voices were certainly the most melodious wild musick i have ever heard
4418015 see a finely rendered three dimensional map of the land of the long white cloud pull a lever and watch as tectonic fault lines converge and mercilessly destroy the very land you are standing upon
4418016 maybe weve gotten too big for this little island of ours
4418017 oh yeah oz next oh maybe vietnam perhaps saudi i hear south america is ace
4418018 back at home people may fade amp end and i might not be there for them though in the capacity of my job i will be there for strangers all the time
4418019 it is a pity because jefferson was in great shape
4418020 but i have full confidence in the strength of our team
4418021 they deserved their win they played some very good football particularly in the first 30 minutes but they couldnt manage a second goal you saw later though that they hadnt quite found their full rhythm
4418022 we want to take an active part in the match earn scoring opportunities and take home two more points than last time when the match ended 1 1
4418023 the pressure is certainly on schalke and not on us
4418024 i think getting into the england squad was a massive boost to deans confidence its seen him go on to another level hes got that ability and looks so natural i see good things for him this year regular england call ups

4418073 we have lowered our gross domestic product forecast for 2008 to 1 2 1 7 previously and to 0 1 0 8 previously for 2009
4418074 for me to be a player in that race i have to be closer at the 50
4418075 i was over a body length behind at the 50 in the prelims and came up a bit short so i have to be there
4418076 het keerpunt ging moeizaam zelfs ik was toen even nerveus
4418077 even was ik bang dat hij het ticket voor de finale zou missen
4418078 dat is zo kort we hadden daarom ook al de medaille uitreiking laten schieten
4418079 i feel extremely proud to be a chinese cheerleader and it is a special honor to perform with the spaniards in the international troupe
4418080 i dont think chinese audiences are that conservative anymore and their thinking about this kind of thing is already rather liberated
4418081 its quite normal to go to the beach and see most young women dressed this way
4418082 the chinese cheerleaders are all beautiful girls wearing fashionable bikinis and this is probably the first time theyve appeared in public in such highly revealing clothes
4418083 all the hard work paid off all the injuries tears blood rips everything pays off at this very moment
4418084 everything just goes away you can only think of good things now
4418085 we came back and we showed the usa is really strong we deserved the top two medals and we showed the world we can come back no matter what
4418086 im still fighting for that medal count with him he has four so i have a few more to go
4418087 its an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him there on the floor exactly 20 years after he competed
4418088 i honestly didnt know until she finished and the scores came up
4418089 obviously i could do with a few more weeks training
4418090 but i am here and i think the fact that im here and im strong very strong actually will be an advantage for me in the race too
4418091 its just about going in and running the best race i can do control yourself and hopefully cope well with the conditions which are going to make it a very tough race
4418092 afterwards we may feel the effects really sore throats blocked noses the day after
4418093 if things go according to plan in the race ill take the suffering afterwards
4418094 the whole thing has just been the hardest thing that ive ever done coming through this
4418095 running outside is what i love doing its much easier to do that than it is to do the huge amounts of cross training looking at walls and not even being outside so certainly when it gets really tough in that race im going to be thinking about walls stuck in front of my face and thats going to be pushing me on
4418096 there were a lot of things going wrong and i almost felt like i was being tested to see if i wanted to be here strongly enough
4418097 theyre a very traditional people a lot of their focus is on traditional healing practices and that seems to have attracted a lot of attention from government agencies including private sector as to what rongoa or natural medicines they are using for a range of health needs
4418098 our concern is that this is a wharenui that is potentially going to have people meeting in it and even sleeping in it potentially so we want to make sure all the things we would look at as we normally would do for a new building making sure that it is safe for people to use and that it is compliant with the building act
4418099 if national attacks the rma the one of the first things that will go is maori involvement in decision making maori consultation and some of the processes around identifying what is important to maori and holding those areas whether it is wahi tapu or rivers those sorts of things back from development so its a direct attack again on maori having control of what goes on in their rohe
4418100 amongst maori and non maori communities particularly those in health social policy now obviously education research and development hes provided enormous leadership significant contributions academically professionally models such as te whare tapawha which recognises dimensions of health have become pivotal in responding to maori health
4418101 its always that way its easy meat its easy meat for middle class middle new zealand to down on benefits treaty claims anything where people are seen to get some benefit that excludes themselves

4418154 da un punto di vista ecologista molto migliore in termini di cambiamenti climatici rispetto a mangiare gli animali terrestri specie se si considerano gli allevamenti intensivi per produrre 1 kg di manzo si producono 18 4 kg di emissioni del gas serra co2 mentre per produrre 1 kg di carne di balena si emettono 2 9 kg di co2
4418155 io ora sono in pensione e distaccata da molte delle controversie sulla caccia alle balene tuttavia i rapporti che si leggono su internet dei progressi finora raggiunti mi convincono che questa stagione sia la pi opportuna per la decisione del governo giapponese di sospendere tutte le operazioni di caccia alla balena delloceano del sud
4418156 dico questo perch sono convinta che la caccia alle balene non dia un contributo alla prevenzione del riscaldamento globale pensiamo solo al costoso carburante che la flotta giapponese consuma nel suo viaggio verso lantartico pi quello consumato dalla nave frigorifera che trasporta i prodotti di balena verso il mercato giapponese lungo gli anni la navi di ricerca giapponesi hanno creato disastri nelloceano quando si sviluppavano incendi dovuti al malgoverno della nave aggiungiamo a questo tutta la confusione fatta dai gruppi animalisti che hanno attaccato le baleniere la caccia commerciale alle balene non in grado di giustificare i costi ambientali il dibattito sui chilometri cibo non ha toccato la carne di balena perch il governo non prende pi seriamente la questione ed elimina la caccia alla balena in ogni sua forma tranne per la caccia costiera su piccola scala
4418157 with so much talk of the devastating impact the credit crunch is having on uk business these finding are encouraging indicating that uk senior management have confidence that their organisations will not only ride out the credit crunch but will profit from it
4418158 there is no denying that the credit crunch is being felt by businesses throughout the uk however organisations can survive it and can even take advantage of it as long as they have the right strategies processes and systems in place the bottom line is that there is always money to be made even in a credit crunch
4418159 the original pregnancy guide podcast voices created for bounty attracted a huge audience there was an obvious demand for bountys valuable content in multi media formats
4418160 the success of the first series encouraged bounty to commission a consecutive second and third the really exciting thing about this project is that unlike a great deal of podcasts we have created shows that in most cases wont go out of date developments in medical science will allow the podcast content to develop but essentially they will remain the same
4418161 the introduction of podcasts on the bounty com site has enabled us to not only offer our existing audience more ways to consume our content but has helped us reach more people and attract additional sponsorship revenue
4418162 no job is entirely recession proof right now job security is the top issue for people and there are many things you can do to improve the chances youll still be in your job in 12 months time here are some strategies to set you on your way
4418163 graduates can be amazing assets to any organisation and if supported and developed properly will be the driving force for future success often the mistake made by many organisations is that the development needed is further academic qualifications in their chosen subjects and although this is required for continual professional development work based skills that are really needed are neglected and taken for granted the last thing graduates want is to be back in the classroom as they are more than ready to get stuck in and kick start their careers it is for this reason why it is imperative that the learning they receive for business skills is impactful innovative and more importantly fun and engaging
4418164 we trialled podcasting last year to engage with show fans and had an incredible response
4418165 our podcasts are content rich and entertaining rather than trying to directly sell tickets one email we sent out prior to the show with a podcast link last year received a 30 response rate all those who responded bought tickets the podcast series is fundamental to our campaign in the run up to the mph featuring top gear live show
4418166 we expect the show to experience an excellent upturn in ticket sales with each new podcast release the quality content and production will no doubt attract tens of thousands of listeners
4418167 when the show moves from london to birminghams nec we will be producing a one off podcast featuring live recorded content from earls court to give listeners a taste of whats coming
4418168 this production successfully demonstrates that podcasting is not a me too medium it really does create audience engagement sales and also offers businesses like clarion the opportunity to have the production funded by sponsorship revenues
4418169 2008 saw the start of a 5 1m 3 year programme of investment at finlake our luxury lodges have been extensively renovated and significantly remodelled we have even extended the accommodation to provide an upstairs bathroom as well as a downstairs wet room
4418170 this is an investment opportunity for lifestyle investors who would enjoy using the lodge themselves for a few weeks of the year whilst taking advantage of our managed letting service to cover annual outgoings and securing a modest but return estimated at 7 1 pa on their initial investment
4418171 last years debate was also on logistics and the environment at a time when the logistics industry was unsure how to move forward i concluded the government needed to think of long term infrastructure and the logistics industry needed to focus on delivering continued increased efficiencies and seeking ways to gain environmental efficiencies through supply chain collaboration
4418172 logistics is not the worst offender by any means but we are very visible to the general public and lobby groups we must do our very best and keep focused to achieve whatever improvement we can
4418173 by introducing greater capacity vehicles we saved 10 million kms annually we have also gained benefits from improved engine specs including 60 vehicles running on compressed natural gas transport collaboration with supply chain partners saved 650 000 kms in 2007 and already 450 000 kms in the first half of 2008
4418174 we must be sure that environmental improvement measurements are such that we can demonstrate improvements while delivering better service at same or lower costs
4418175 this might show they are trying to do something positive but little else the second put time and effort into gathering the total detail to get a database of information which can be used to identify changes in each area of the supply chain
4418176 are manufacturers likely to reverse recent decisions to make products in eastern european countries or the far east to save on carbon emissions will retailers be prepared to cut their margins and buy their goods closer to home
4418177 we see the power of innovation more efficient operations less empty running co2 per tonne kilometre down but are absolute uk emissions falling but it is partly as a result of developments like off shoring and cabotage
4418178 in the food supply chain food transport is responsible for just 2
4418179 will todays dcs configurations hold up in these alternative worlds the local sector is characterised by low tech penetration and small half loaded vehicles but what if everything were local what ethical expectations will consumers have what will logistics operators do without big stores what does efficiency look like in this world is efficiency a reality or a pipedream then
4418180 public opinion and the media traditionally associate logistics with high green house gas emissions however recent carbon footprint lifecycle assessments on products such as beer crisps and smoothies showed that the distribution element of the total footprint was only around 10 although we are working towards targets set on the continent the uk market places higher environmental demands than any other market in europe
4418181 sharing resources is core to our business so multi user warehouses and transport networks with their associated environmental benefits are at the heart of our culture collaboration with our customers and suppliers remains instrumental in the development and achievement of environmental goals
4418182 the current costs of fuel intensify the pressure to find ways to use resources more sparingly the logistics industry is environmentally efficient logistics providers have a contribution to make towards environmentally efficient supply chains and we should do so this is our bread amp butter

4418193 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4418194 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4418195 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4418196 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4418197 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty
4418198 its much more difficult than previous years when there were bigger motifs
4418199 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4418200 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4418201 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal

4418207 this year has not been very good for china theres been a lot of disasters so these olympic games theres a lot of pressure its impossible not to be nervous and its how to cope with the nerves is our job and right now i feel very excited

4418212 its been a tough three games for us but the tournament is still in progress
4418213 after missing the first couple it seemed like i kept forcing it
4418214 it was totally in my head not taking the time to relax and put it where i needed to put it

4418243 i fought in that war perhaps i was killed i do not know
4418244 we fought for a great principle and for the peace and happiness of a world i hope that we did not fight in vain
4418245 if you mean that you hope that your principle will triumph because you fought and won or that peace will come your hopes are futile war never brought peace it but brings more and greater war war is natures natural state it is folly to combat it peace should be considered only as a time for preparation for the principle business of mans existence were it not for constant warring of one form of life upon another and even upon itself the planets would be so over run with life that it would smother itself out we found upon barsoom that long periods of peace brought plagues and terrible diseases that killed more than the wars killed and in a much more hideous and painful way there is neither pleasure nor thrill nor reward of any sort to be gained by dying in bed of a loathesome disease we must all die let us therefore go out and die in some great and exciting game and make room for the millions who are to follow us we have tried it out upon barsoom and we would not be without war

4418254 beim freitauchen gibt es keine atemger te die lunge ist zusammengepresst und mit blutplasma gef llt das schafft ein raucher nicht
4418255 bevor ich abtauche muss ich meinen herzschlag mit speziellen yoga hnlichen bungen auf 12 bis 14 schl ge pro minute bringen
4418256 w hrend des trainings bin ich beim auftauchen auch schon mal bewusstlos geworden da hatte ich meine leistungskraft falsch eingesch tzt
4418257 ich riskiere nichts deshalb werde ich auch nie einen schlitten zum tieftauchen benutzen mit dem schon weltrekorde von ber 200 meter getaucht wurden doch dabei sind auch schon sportler ums leben gekommen

4418260 selbstmordattent ter sprengten touristen und einheimische an drei belebten pl tzen in die luft es gab 25 tote darunter ein deutscher junge ber 50 menschen wurden verletzt die freundin aus der schweiz verlor ein bein der engl nder hat splitter im k rper die schrecklichen bilder werde ich nie vergessen
4418261 ich hatte erlebt was sprengstoffe anrichten k nnen als minentaucher wollte ich dazu beitragen dass sprengfallen und minen beseitigt werden k nnen ich bewarb mich bei den minentauchern
4418262 jeder marinesoldat kann sich f r eine ausbildung zum minentaucher bewerben
4418263 doch es bewerben sich nur gut ein dutzend soldaten und schon beim vorbereitungstest fallen ber 70 prozent der bewerber durch
4418264 die leute sind nicht mehr bereit sich zu qu len
4418265 ich habe w hrend des minentaucherlehrgangs nie ans aufgeben gedacht auch wenn es sehr hart war ich will tauchen ich will viel wasser um mich haben und das finde ich nur bei den minentauchern der marine
4418266 am verlangten niveau k nnen wir keine abstriche machen das w rde nur das leben der soldaten selbst gef hrden und weil wir eine so harte auswahl treffen gab es bisher erst sehr wenige unf lle bei den minentauchern
4418267 solange ein freitaucher nicht alleine trainiert und nichts riskiert ist das abtauchen ungef hrlich

4418275 we are delighted that our development in a generally weak environment is a clear sign of the benefit of highly qualified jobs in germany our company attracts high performers and these are exactly the people we need to continue our successful progress

4418281 still using repossession as the first rather than last resort
4418282 every day shelter is seeing more and more ordinary hardworking people who are terrified of losing their homes theyre being punished by rising household bills escalating fuel charges and food prices that are going through the roof
4418283 tens of thousands are living with the fear of having the home theyve worked so hard for being repossessed by lenders with little compassion
4418284 lenders must play their part and ensure they look at all the options before rushing to the court and use repossession as the last rather than first option
4418285 the government needs to show it really is on peoples side when they are facing the threat of repossession
4418286 while we are not seeing repossessions on the same scale as the early 1990s we are making sure the right advice and support is available for the minority of borrowers who may need it at the moment because of global economic pressures
4418287 as well as expanding free legal representation in county courts for households at risk of repossession we are providing more free debt advice and are working closely with lenders to ensure that repossession is only ever a last resort

4418290 il y a un an un ami a commenc me poser des questions sur ma foi
4418291 au travers de ces conversations j ai perdu ma foi en l islam
4418292 la plus grande difficult pour moi tait de croire en la doctrine de la trinit
4418293 fahmir a t baptis et a pris un nom chr tien
4418294 je veux devenir un mollah chr tien le seigneur m a montr le chemin
4418295 selon fahmir dans la r gion o il habite environ deux cents personnes sont ouvertes l evangile plusieurs afghans se sont convertis christ depuis la chute du r gime taliban
4418296 je viens dune famille de mollahs mon grand p re mon p re mon fr re a n et moi nous sommes tous des mollahs il y a environ un an un de mes amis a commenc me poser des questions et ma montr que le coran nest pas un livre authentique il ne vient pas de dieu au travers de nos conversations jai perdu ma foi dans lislam
4418297 ces conversations se d roulent tout le temps en priv au sein de groupes damis mon ami ma pr sent un autre monsieur qui ma donn une bible et a commenc menseigner propos du christianisme javais beaucoup de questions la plus grosse difficult pour moi tait la trinit le concept faisant de dieu trois personnes p re fils et saint esprit est anath me pour les musulmans qui croient que dieu est un et que donc il ne peut pas avoir de fils il a essay dexpliquer ce concept et dieu a commenc ouvrir mon intelligence et de cette fa on je me suis orient vers la foi chr tienne
4418298 r cemment vous avez d cid d tre baptis comment avez vous pris cette d cision
4418299 dans la religion islamique nous avons la circonsision qui est un signe certain que vous tes musulman jai su que le saint esprit avait fait quelque chose dans ma vie je voulais maintenant en signe dob issance faire le pas du bapt me et devenir chr tien ouvertement quand jai t baptis on ma donn un nouveau nom mon nom chr tien est timoth e
4418300 alors timoth e comment le fait de devenir chr tient a t il chang votre vie
4418301 ma vie ant rieure tait totalement morte en tant que mollah nous avons toujours une attitude de compromis nous pourrions m me dormir dans certaines situations mais il nexiste pas ce genre de concept dans le christianisme je ne peux pas revenir ce genre de vie je sens que cest la gr ce de dieu qui ma sorti de l ma choisi et ma permis d tre baptis
4418302 est ce que des membres de votre famille sont au courant de votre conversion
4418303 deux de mes fr res le savent lun deux est en train de chercher mais je suis inquiet pour mon fr re a n car cest un mollah et son moyen dexistence d pend de sa bonne conduite en tant que oullah jai d cid de ne plus le voir pendant un moment
4418304 maintenant que tu as perdu ton moyen de subsistance comment comptes tu gagner ta vie
4418305 je veux tre un chr tien mollah le seigneur est en train de me montrer le chemin je sais bien parler jai appris lart de la pr dication dans une mosqu e maintenant je veux pr cher pour le seigneur je veux tre un pr dicateur partout dans le monde
4418306 moi et un ami nous nous d pla ons parmi les gens nous les abordons de mani re tr s pratique nous leur offrons du th nous nous asseyons avec eux et ceux que nous sentons r ceptifs et dispos s parler de choses spirituelles nous passons plus de temps avec eux et laissons les conversations se d rouler naturellement
4418307 avec la gr ce de dieu oui il y a un endroit o nous pouvons aller nous avons des contacts et environ 200 personnes sont tr s ouvertes pour entendre le message aujourdhui nous pourrions y aller et ouvrir une glise dans la maison de quelquun
4418308 ainsi vous croyez r ellement quen afghanistan le temps viendra o les glises seront ouvertes et o l vangile pourra tre librement proclam
4418309 oui absolument je sens que les gens en ont tellement marre des talibans et de lislam quils naccepteront rien dautre que j sus christ il ne peuvent pas r v ler tout de suite ces sentiments les coles islamiques et les mollahs ont trop puissants mais quand nous parlons nous trouvons un type qui est r ceptif et alors il dit quil conna t quatre ou cinq autres personnes qui pensent la m me chose et il nous les am ne cest ainsi que le mouvement est en train de s tendre
4418310 premi rement nous savons quil y a beaucoup de gens en afghanistan qui en ont marre ils ont vu le fondamentalisme musulman et ils ne veulent pas revenir a priez pour que dieu occasionne des circonstances qui leur permettront dexprimer librement leurs d sirs ceci est la premi re tape mais deuxi mement m me si ces gens doivent rester dans lombre l glise doit avoir une direction nous avons besoin de pasteurs de confiance qui peuvent guider les gens travers les moments difficiless pour que le fruit ne se perde pas
4418311 han forklarer at det skyldes at usa er baseret p indvandring og at det derfor er nemmere at acceptere

4418313 een holle staaf wordt via de vagina in de buikholte ingebracht zie foto door die staaf kan dan een micro instrument geduwd worden daarmee moet de blindedarm afgeknipt worden met de hulp van een micro camera die door de nagelbuik steekt kan ik de ingreep bekijken pijn voelt de pati nt niet want de operatie gebeurt onder volledige narcose bij het inbrengen van de draad moet wel een kleine snede in de vagina gemaakt worden maar studies wijzen uit dat dit geen negatieve impact heeft op het seksleven van de pati nt
4418314 ik ben zo blij bij een normale operatie zou ik nu een litteken hebben en dat is echt niet wenselijk in het bikiniseizoen
4418315 si ce soir vous et moi devriez mourir est ce que nous irions paradis
4418316 mon fils je ne sais pas et je ne peux pas savoir parce que le coran ne dit pas clairement si nous pouvons entrer au paradis
4418317 si vous et moi devriez mourir est ce que nous irons paradis
4418318 ce soir je viens votre cabane pour bavarder avec vous
4418319 vous savez que je suis un musulman et mahomet est mon proph te allah est mon dieu si vous faites encore cela je quitterais le bateau et retournerais chez moi abidjan
4418320 je rentre la maison pour partager le peu dargent que jai gagn avec mes parents parce quils sont pauvres alors que pour vous vous tes tr s riche
4418321 je ne suis pas riche tout appartient dieu il me la donn pour ma famille et pour mes besoins
4418322 cest plus facile pour un chameau passer par le trou dune aiguille que pour un homme riche dentrer dans le royaume de dieu
4418323 en v rit lhomme est ingrat envers son seigneur et lui m me en est t moin
4418324 celui qui aura fait des oeuvre pleine dans la balance aura pour demeure le paradis mais celui qui aura fais de moins bonnes oeuvres aura pour demeure le foss le foss est un feu ardent
4418325 si je suis p cheur d j selon la sourate 100 comment puis je faire plus des bonnes oeuvres que des mauvaises pour aller au paradis
4418326 vous verrez lenfer vous verrez certainement lenfer et vous rendrez compte de vos bien fait sur cette terre
4418327 si le seigneur avait voulu ainsi il aurait fait de toutes les nations un seul peuple mais ils ne cesseront pas de d battre et la parole et la volont du seigneur doit saccomplir quand elle dit je remplirai enti rement lenfer des hommes et des jinns la fois
4418328 il n y aura aucun dentre vous qui ny soit pr cipiter puis lon sauvera ceux qui craignent dieu et les m chants vont rest genoux
4418329 donc moussa toi qui menait une vie des pri res avec votre p re tu es aussi ici avec nous
4418330 dites nous croyons en allah et en ce quon nous a r v l et en ce quon na fait descendre vers abraham et isma l et isaac et jacob et les tribus et au livre qui a t donn mo se et j sus et au livre qui a t donn aux proph tes venant de leur seigneur nous ne faisons aucune distinction entre eux et lui nous sommes soumis
4418331 avant larriv e de mahomet et de lislam la parole de dieu existait d j avec les chr tien pourquoi est ce que dieu enverrait une autre parole contradictoire parce que le coran et la bible sont compl tement oppos
4418332 et si tu es en doute sur ce que nous tavons fait conna tre interroge alors ceux qui lisent le livre r v l avant toi la v rit certes test venue de ton seigneur ne sois donc point de ceux qui doutent
4418333 mahomet si vous tes en doute demandez ceux l qui ont re u les saintes ecritures avant vous
4418334 ceux qui ont re u les saintes ecritures avant moi
4418335 mahomet galement a p ch alors donc comment est il que j sus na jamais p ch pourquoi est ce quil est au dessus de tous les autres proph tes
4418336 oh j sus je vous ferai subir la mort je vous l verai moi et je vous d livrerai des incr dules et ce qui vous suivent seront au dessus ce qui ne croient pas en vous jusquau jour de r surrection vous reviendrez moi je jugerai vos diff rences
4418337 ils ne lont pas tu ils ne lont pas crucifi
4418338 dieu a dit j sus je vous ferai subir la mort je vous l verai moi
4418339 si ces preuves que je traverse sont de dieu alors il devrait me le prouver physiquement
4418340 mon p re est imam quand je suis avec lui je conduis les pri res tous mes oncles sont des imams je suis le descendant dun imam pour cette raison je ne peux pas abandonner lislam
4418341 est ce que vous tes fou que je serais venu faire dans votre chambre cet heure

4418348 es bildeten sich gegnergruppen gegen castingshows und bald wurde das image einer castingsendung so weit runterkritisiert das keiner mehr schauen wollte und neue superstars wie elli tobias regner oder brosis und nu pagadi v llig untergingen und sich kurz danach aufl sten
4418349 genauso schnell wie die castings ins negative fielen ging auch der deutsche hip hop baden mit vorreitern wie sido bushido und kool savas wollte man der amerikanischen industrie konkurrenz und schaffte das auch die teenies in deutschland waren begeistert und kauften die cds etwas das heute eher rar ist doch schon bald wurde man experimentierfreudiger und die texte wurden immer heftiger und nicht mehr jugendfrei sogar der bundestag setzte sich gegen die rapper welle ein und beendete sie vorerst nur noch die wirklich starken k mpfer sido und bushido haben das berlebt und k nnen weiterhin ihre platten herausbringen der rest der rapperfront ist verschollen oder untergetaucht ein kurzer moment im rampenlicht war das meine lieben

4418626 having recently received our mill permit it is exciting to see mill construction underway in addition now we have mill equipment at or being transported to our marshalling yard in laredo texas in anticipation of ultimately clearing customs on their way to the aguila mill site we are optimistic the next federal permit for the mill tailings facility will be granted shortly so construction of the tailings facility can begin permits dictate our production time frame and though we do not see any issues that would preclude the granting of the remaining permits it is apparent that our production time frame will now push into the first quarter of 2009
4418627 gold resource corporation has come a long way in less than two years as a public company and we fully expect to continue our aggressive pace as we establish gold production at our flagship el aguila project
4418628 could have a substantial impact in industries such as the electronics and computer industries where the largest companies with hundreds if not thousands of patents regularly cross license each others portfolios to avoid internecine patent litigation
4418629 patent owners will have to find ways to minimize its impact
4418630 in particular the decision does not prevent the use of contractual clauses or remedies to preserve or to replicate a patent owners options
4418631 the government has said that the construction industry will be one of the sectors that will remain buoyant but for small timers like its getting increasingly difficult to remain in business
4418632 i realised that without a university degree i couldnt have risen beyond the rank of major in the army and it would have taken my lifetime to earn a million the car business lacked honesty i had to extol the virtues of a car even after it had been badly bashed up in an accident so i joined my brother
4418633 we did reasonably well for a while and even won a few awards for the quality of our conservation projects despite the currency crisis of 1997 blueprint remained profitable up to 2001
4418634 i tried getting my 33 year old civil engineer from nanyang technological university to take over he wants to make money but doesnt want to bear the risk
4418635 it was getting too tough to keep pace with the rising cost of building materials
4418636 for example sand because of an embargo by the indonesian government shot up from 14 per tonne in 2006 to 60 per tonne in 2007 and now hovers at 40 per tonne construction steel was 800 per tonne in 2006 1 100 in 2007 and 1 800 this year
4418637 i dont think my daughter is suited for the rough life of a contractor and i dont think my son would be interested in the business
4418638 between 1997 and the end of 2006 many construction companies both big and small have folded suffering severe losses
4418639 um bom sinal que os portugueses pensem isso porque confiam em n s e isso d nos valor
4418640 sinto me melhor que em osaka e capaz de voltar a fazer o que fiz l
4418641 god bless you my sons you saved so many lives
4418642 stupid by killing civilians you will never go to paradise
4418643 we have seen a 75 percent increase in calls to our hotline since the start of advertising the number through kaka nijat this year
4418644 people usually call to inform police about explosions and suicide bombings
4418645 we are trying to encourage the people to help the security forces in the fight against terrorists who are using islam as a tool for their purposes
4418646 he teaches us how to call police when we see bad people
4418647 since watching kaka nijat now we know the police number we know how the suicide bombers look how they dress
4418648 it is the most effective weapon used by the insurgents in terms of inflicting casualties
4418649 when times are tough people spend less in pubs and bars and more in stores for consumption at home consumers that are feeling the pinch will also trade down from premium to mainstream brands or from mainstream to economy brands
4418650 but many customers are definitely going for the cheaper option
4418651 consumers sometimes have a tendency to marginally trade up or down depending on their personal situation but we have not seen major shifts in demand patterns over the last 12 months as yet
4418652 beer traditionally follows the dynamics of non durable goods and so just like food it has not shown a significant downturn in the current climate

4418654 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4418655 theyve done such a miserable job these last two years i think they should leave not get bonuses of 40 000 to 50 000
4418656 the kicker of course is the person who was hired to reform the bonus system received the biggest bonus
4418657 what we are talking about here is the need to have highly experienced highly capable technical experts that without which the country would suffer
4418658 these should be referred to not as retention bonuses but blackmail bonuses
4418659 aber die politik an sich hat an schulen sehr wohl etwas zu suchen denn politische bildung kann ja nicht im luftleeren raum passieren
4418660 at present influenza immunity relates only to specific strains and simply does not exist in the event of a new pandemic outbreak the ongoing outbreaks and spread of the highly pathogenic h5n1 virus in poultry and wild birds have led to fears that a subtype that is transmissible from human to human could emerge therefore the ability to detect and type influenza virus immediately is essential in setting up appropriate controls as quickly as possible to minimise the spread of any potential pandemic virus

4418665 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4418666 i wanted to do a relatable grounded character comedy about marriage and the lengths we go to preserve the spark
4418667 tina and steve are smart and relatable and the tone of their comedy perfectly fits this film
4418668 the bbc need an alternative and graham is their man he is currently talking to bosses about the

4418670 former eastern bloc countries are not sufficiently versed in the ways of democracy to realise they are supposed to be voting for a song not a next door neighbour
4418671 i hope to see the law society the sra and organisations representing bme solicitors work together to tackle these problems and show other organisations what can be done
4418672 the ouseley review found evidence of some stereotyping within the sra which led to an assumption of guilt in respect of lawyers from some communities even before an investigation had begun
4418673 it found evidence of a greater proportion of bme solicitors referred to the solicitors disciplinary board a greater proportion of cases where a decision was made to intervene in the practise and a disproportionate number barred from student applications or admission to the roll
4418674 while making clear its findings of institutional racism the report also makes a broad range of recommendations to help elminate this from applying equality and diversity strategies to working with the law society to develop better systems of support and guidance
4418675 the upside of this review is that its clear that the public sector equality duties which have led to impact assessments being carried out are leading to proper investigation of practises that would previously remain hidden something that members of the public suspect but cannot establish
4418676 it also reveals how affected we all are by stereotypes of different communities and how this affects the ability of people to be scrupulously fair
4418677 for the legal profession it also raises other issues why do more ethnic minorities become sole practitioners what are the barriers to them achieving success in larger firms and how can this be tackled do sole practitioners require greater assistance and support
4418678 this issue of support and guidance is of increasing importance as fees for legal aid practitioners are cut and lawyers in this sector who are disproportionately bme will have to operate on lower incomes
4418679 the meteoric rise in the cost of living is affecting virtually every household and age group it is leaving a hole in our pockets that pay rises alone cannot fill
4418680 with energy bills continuing to burn a hole in households dwindling pockets consumers need to take steps to minimise their energy usage and reduce the amount they pay

4418689 we started to tell people the week after we found the body but no on believed us
4418690 so we started to make fun of the bigfoot trackers and that got attention
4418691 you type in bigfoot and thats the name that comes up
4418692 be still my heart i felt bad for the poor thing
4418693 after being in the industry for the past 30 years i wondered was it diseased did it die of old age
4418694 if the guy claims to have a body he really should produce one
4418695 unfortunately this kind of incident simply just casts further aspersion on the topic
4418696 theres always an interest in these creatures dating back hundreds of years mermaids unicorns dragons
4418697 there isnt a populated place on earth that doesnt have these kinds of creatures
4418698 i accept or deny evidence based upon the evidence we have about bigfoot 80 percent is proof and 20 percent is myth
4418699 99 percent a hoax and 1 percent a probability of reality

4418707 a group of young muslims executed martyrdom operations that put fear in the apostate government and its infidel allies the americans and jews the mujahidin belonging to islamic jihad group attacked both the american and israeli embassies as well as the court building where the trials of a large number of the brothers from the group had begun these martyrdom operations that the group is executing will not stop god willing it is for the purpose of repelling the injustice of the apostate government and supporting the jihad of our muslim brothers in iraq palestine afghanistan the hijaz and in other muslim countries ruled by infidels and apostates
4418708 the department of state on may 25 announced the designation of the islamic jihad group ijg as a specially designated global terrorist under executive order 13224 this designation blocks all property and interests in property of the organization that are in the united states or come within the united states or the control of u s persons the secretary of state took this action in consultation with the attorney general the secretary of the treasury and the department of homeland security the islamic jihad group active in central asia broke away from the islamic movement of uzbekistan imu a specially designated global terrorist organization that is listed by the un 1267 sanctions committee on july 30 2004 the islamic jihad group conducted coordinated bombing attacks in tashkent against the u s and israeli embassies and the office of the uzbek prosecutor general killing at least two people and wounding nine the islamic jihad group claimed responsibility for these attacks and indicated that future attacks are planned the islamic jihad group continues to target americans and u s facilities overseas and is a dangerous threat to u s interests after an explosion at a safehouse in bukharo uzbekistan ijg suicide bombers attacked a popular bazaar and other locations in tashkent in march and april 2004 resulting in the deaths of more than a dozen police officers and innocent bystanders and dozens of injuries the attackers in the march and april 2004 attacks some of whom were female suicide bombers targeted the local government offices of the uzbekistani and bukharo police killing approximately 47 people including 33 terrorists these attacks marked the first use of female suicide bombers in central asia those arrested in connection with the attacks in bukharo have testified to the close ties between the ijg leaders and usama bin laden and mullah omar kazakhstani authorities have declared that ijg members were taught by al qaida instructors to handle explosives and to organize intelligence work and subversive activities kazakhstan has arrested several ijg members and put them on trial
4418709 after the fall of the afganistan islamic administration we who shared the same opinions came together and decided to organize groups which will conduct jihad operations against the infidel constitution of cruel karimov in uzbekistan
4418710 members of our union are not members of a specific tribe or a nation as there is no nationalism and tribalism in islam our union is formed of the believers from all over the world and multi national emigrants travelling to praise the religion
4418711 today we proceed according to our targeted goals with all our means muslim youth in the republics of former soviet union who found the path of allah and are ready to fight for their religion have been trained in various fields in the training facilities of the union one of the armed forces of the union is active in afghanistan besides we have been in contact and also been working on our common targets together with caucasian mujahedeens we have also been working together on plans and aims against the infidel regime of uzbekistan which is one of our major targets
4418712 one hour after they drank red bull their blood systems were no longer normal they were abnormal like we would expect in a patient with cardiovascular disease
4418713 the study does not show effects which would go beyond that of drinking a cup of coffee therefore the reported results were to be expected and lie within the normal physiological range
4418714 the dollars continuing uptrend is a key factor depressing commodities in general and triggering heavy sales in gold
4418715 japanese players are dumping their long term positions after breaking through key levels this week the market may be oversold but the market is still in a downward trend
4418716 its still early to say its the end of the super cycle but if the markets continue to fall like they are doing now i am sure many people will be talking about it very soon
4418717 the region around 750 is very important because this is a long term gold uptrend support so if its broken golds really gone
4418718 well have some people targeting 750 but i think we would need to see a continuation in that dollar strength to give it sufficient momentum to head that way
4418719 near term support should be around 12 38 then 12 00s
4418720 on a more bearish note we could in fact head all the way down to 11 50s because the long term uptrend seems to be breached as of todays sharp downward movement
4418721 and your point is what nobody said it was proof that all layers everywhere at all times in earths history have formed quickly what i have been saying over and over and over which apparently took you two weeks to figure out is that these layers had to have formed quickly you cannot have a living tree or a dead tree taking millions of years to be buried in a vertical position by horizontal layers is that so difficult why the straw man argument now now that you realize the problem with polystrate trees and the problem with carbon dating perhaps we can advance beyond kindergarten and explain to you that all of the radiometric dating schemes operate in open systems are seriously flawed and not reliable for dating the age of the earth obviously if the trees do not represent millions of years of sedimentation neither do the fossils found in the same layers represent millions of years of evolution rather what you see is the sequence in which things were rapidly buried
4418722 mutations kill the host or atleast make em sick and do not get passed down to offspring so how did both male and female evolve
4418723 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs this pay offer is an insult to professional hard working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions
4418724 we are demanding a national solution to this dispute which addresses the real cost increases our members face unite has requested a national level meeting with the company to resolve this dispute but the clock is ticking and if this does not deliver our members will strike
4418725 chibhende means speaking obliquely of something in order not to blow its cover or in order to speak about it more comfortably
4418726 sex is difficult to handle in a shy language like shona
4418727 slang gives the unspeakable street value by making it look accessible and banal
4418728 language can neither be separated from our thoughts and feelings nor from the social context in which it is used
4418729 words and images create different conceptual realities of the phenomenon

4418735 i found out my husband was unethical when i was spying on him so i had an affair and now im trying to get him to be honest cant imagine why he is so quiet
4418736 i remember not kissing you the first time because i left your place in a hurry and kind of flew out of the door the next time i saw you was at work and neither of us really made an attempt to kiss each other when we went out to our cars and after that i guess it just felt weird because we werent intimate hadnt been intimate in such a long time that it just stopped then even the kisses in texts stopped so it was just i dont know it felt weird then i guess
4418737 i just never truly know where i stand with you you blow hot and cold and i never really know how to take that one minute we can be kissing each other totally into each other and my mouth round your cock then the next time i see you its almost as if it never happened i know i want you and that sexually you excite me and turn me on like never before but my life is so complicated and i need to not have complications
4418738 we delivered good sales and earnings growth this quarter establishing momentum as we enter the back to school and fall bake periods
4418739 we are particularly pleased that we are experiencing sales growth across most of our brands despite taking significant price increases to offset record raw material costs our strategy of owning number one brands and supporting them with consistent investments in marketing and product innovation provides opportunities for continued long term profitable growth
4418740 well the sex has been great but nothing else has really changed has it
4418741 in july 2008 we commenced the construction of a new milk powder processing facility in hailun city heilongjiang province and expect that we can double our total capacity to approximately 18 000 tons by the end of 2009
4418742 we are confident that the increase in capacity will contribute to our sales growth and improve our gross margin performance in the long run
4418743 al deze kranten kregen geld omdat twee parlementari rs een verklaring tekenden dat hun krant een orgaan betrof van een politieke beweging die vaak niet eens bestond
4418744 principieel vind ik het juist dat kranten geen geld uit de staatskas ontvangen omdat de onafhankelijkheid van een krant met staatsfinanciering in het geding komt
4418745 maar waar het gaat om partijkranten vind ik het goed dat politieke partijen middels publicaties hun programmas bekend kunnen maken ook voor de co peratieve bladen vind ik het een slechte zaak dat deze subsidie wordt ingetrokken
4418746 een miljard alles bij elkaar opgeteld is het bedrag gestegen tot een miljard per jaar
4418747 de grote bedragen gaan naar de grote kranten zoals la repubblica en corriere della sera de kranten die het meest worden getroffen door deze maatregel zijn juist de armste kranten en de nieuwe regel maakt geen onderscheid tussen nepco peraties en de echte co peratieve projecten
4418748 er zijn echte kranten van echte politieke partijen echte kranten van valse politieke partijen en nepkranten van neppartijen
4418749 een begeleide ontmanteling van de subsidies waardoor een krant in drie jaar tijd onafhankelijk moet worden
4418750 het probleem kan niet gedeeltelijk worden opgelost er moet een einde komen aan het belangenconflict de verstrengeling van berlusconis politieke en mediabelangen het debat over de financiering van de kranten is in principe terecht maar het gaat om de enorme illegaliteit die aan de basis van dit probleem staat en juist dat verhindert dat het mogelijk is om deze kwestie op te lossen
4418751 onze premier bezit nogal wat kranten en hij wurgt de uitgeverijen de investeringen in de reclame zijn ook grotendeels in handen van de premier via het bedrijf publitalia en gaan voor het leeuwendeel naar de televisie naar mediaset het commerci le tv bedrijf van de premier

4418759 cluster bombs are indiscriminate killers that most nations have agreed to outlaw said marc garlasco senior military analyst at human rights watch in a statement

4418773 we are quite satisfied with this agreement as far as county road use
4418774 we have been pressing to have the agreement with a local facility in livingston county and initially they wanted to use a bank of their choosing
4418775 we have progressed to the point in talking about livingston county banks but we havent come to terms of the type of investment
4418776 the highly intrusive impact of such turbines would represent a major change to the appearance and valued open character of this highly sensitive landscape
4418777 officers are clear that while this current proposal is the most intrusive there would be a combining effect when viewed with those at royd moor and crow edge
4418778 the wind turbines would be overlooking two conservation areas which need to be protected and that point combined with the fact they will be on the edge of a national park makes it a very difficult application to support
4418779 its a scary prospect to put turbines in here among all the homes
4418780 local governments should still have a say in the matter
4418781 they said we didnt have the right to pass our own ordinance
4418782 but as the chairman of the assembly committee on energy and utilities i have a responsibility to meet state criteria and have statewide policies in place
4418783 we need a statewide policy or nobodys going to want to come develop wind farms here
4418784 he says his head feels like its spinning 100 mph not just from the sound but the shadows flickering on his walls
4418785 im just angry state officials have let it get to this point working in the garden used to be relaxing
4418786 frankly id rather have a nuclear power plant three quarters of a mile away
4418787 i mean if you want to see a train wreck and something that would just shut the state down economically itd be having to have developers and companies go through 3 000 plus governing bodies to get their projects done
4418788 but you get these developers coming in and they sit on the boards and committees drawing up the rules
4418789 it isnt just the noise and the visual impact of the turbines although they are obvious things people are worried about it is also the effect on house prices
4418790 people are worried and angry but we are also remaining positive
4418791 people need to be aware that the next step could be a full application and i hope before then they have made up their minds on where they stand
4418792 we aim to erect the meteorological mast in the next four or six weeks until we have the figures we wont know how many turbines there will be or their layout but we do not expect it to be more than five we will be holding a public consultation once we have the data
4418793 hamlins town board has the power to exclude industrial scale wind farms from this lakeside community or to mandate minimum setback requirements and noise standards that would protect its residents health and preserve property values and the towns rural character
4418794 it chose instead to enact weak and ineffective standards that will facilitate wind farm development at the expense of nearby homeowners and the towns scenic resources
4418795 its great to have a whole bunch of renewable generation sitting up here but if you dont have the pipeline to get it there its not going to happen
4418796 thats a key opportunity for suppliers in areas such as new brunswick
4418797 the magnitude of that is such that experts in new england are forecasting a shortfall of 6 000 8 000 megawatts of electricity in the next 12 15 years
4418798 so its possible to locate wind generating facilities without intruding on residential areas
4418799 thats a key advantage over new england in terms of being able to locate a wind generator without having concerns on the part of residents who dont want a wind generator in their backyard

4418802 it is large like a cell tower and we think there needs to be some guidance
4418803 we have made our agreements for them to pay for our attorneys and consulting fees and we expect to have the tif agreements ready for a public hearing in the next month or two
4418804 they are staying in our hotels eating in our establishments and utilizing our stores
4418805 this is an ideal situation for us because we have lots of yard space to repair and store things
4418806 i understand where flight for life is coming from their decision makes sense but what about the health and safety of the people who reside in the project areas and that of those people driving through as well i have some real concerns
4418807 the pilots would make a judgement at the time if the wind turbines are too close together that it would not be safe for us to land right there we would land in an area thats safe right on the perimeter
4418808 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4418809 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4418810 it will be a major accomplishment for georgia to get the russians out of their country and back effectively to the status quo ante
4418811 any measures that they are allowed to take have got to be of a very limited nature for a very limited period of time
4418812 i look forward to going to poland to sign that agreement soon
4418813 its important for the peace and security of the region its important for peace and security internationally
4418814 very limited to a light patrolling ability such as a few kilometers outside of south ossetia not the right to maintain a presence inside georgia
4418815 the russian president has said that their military operations have halted we have hoped that he would be true to his word and that those operations will halt

4418873 what was unique about bud and his films was the water footage and the fact that he lived with the surfers he was filming

4418876 he told me to surf like he wasnt there so i did
4418877 i am tucked deep into this monster barrel and there is bud right in the way filming me i figured that he was gonna dive under before i ran him down wrong he just stayed right here filming and i took him out like a greyhound bus nailing a highway dog
4418878 that was a big deal to go to buds movies and to see if you were in it
4418879 when i got a chance to make one of my own i went to bud and said i dont want to do it without your blessing

4418882 he was allowed inside as one of them even though he was quite different than they were
4418883 he was a traditional old school gentleman and they were rambunctious rebels but somehow they coexisted and he recorded their lives and their culture as it expanded from a few hundred surfers in the 50s to several million in the 60s and he and his films helped fan the flames of that growth
4418884 he loved to bungee jump and he bungee jumped until he was 86

4419030 echte trendwende eine abkehr von einer entwicklung die seit 35 jahren immer mehr arbeitslosigkeit brachte
4419031 die aktuelle entwicklung ist gekennzeichnet durch neue auch ausl ndische anbieter die sich im deutschen gasmarkt etablieren durch zunehmend mehr festpreisangebote und geringere mindestabnahmemengen
4419032 der zunehmende wettbewerb bietet unternehmen die gas beziehen eine chance aktuell zwar nicht von sinkenden preisen aber doch von g nstigeren konditionen zu profitieren wenn bestimmte kriterien erf llt werden

4419034 we conclude that the human rights situation in colombia is serious and shows little sign of improvement we further conclude that allegations of extra judicial executions by the colombian military and the continued targeting of trade unionists cannot be ignored we therefore believe it is inappropriate for the government to provide military aid to colombia without any reference to human rights improvements
4419035 noting recent moves by the us congress to freeze some aid to colombia on human rights grounds we recommend that the government should request the colombian military to demonstrate measurable and verifiable human rights improvements in exchange for future assistance
4419036 accurately to reflect the seriousness of the human rights situation
4419037 units implicated in serious human rights abuses such as the high mountain brigades
4419038 the problem is that the military aid the british government grant to colombia is unconditional with regard to any kind of human rights improvements we think that that sends a bad message the military in colombia will go on getting these military goodies without having to do anything in return with respect to human rights
4419039 the uk seems to be being saddled with a policy that even the american government have moved beyond after the democrats took control of congress last year they froze some military aid to colombia on human rights grounds we think that the uk should at least get back into step with the policy of the americans

4419065 it was a question of getting it right first time because this was the bands last concert we were also aware that the film crew were running an expensive six camera shoot using 16mm film and digital video so there was absolutely no room for error

4419070 youve got to pay taxes on those assets on the way out
4419071 that wont happen they cant do that that cant be done we will have warning of such an attack
4419072 i dont need no stinkin benchmark because i only use index funds so my portfolio is the benchmark
4419073 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4419074 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
4419075 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
4419076 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4419077 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration
4419078 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4419079 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4419080 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4419081 absolute return portfolio produced an annualized 13 1 percent exceeding the passive benchmark of the
4419082 absolute return portfolio produced an annualized 13 1 percent exceeding the passive benchmark of the
4419083 as sort of a clearing house for proper portfolios benchmarking
4419084 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4419085 that problem is pretty easily solved by calculating a portfolios time weighted return rather than irr or dollar weighted return and comparing the twr to the benchmark return twr removes the impact of cash flows on portfolio performance
4419086 you bring up a major issue with performance measurement cash flows in a portfolio are handled differently than cash flows in an index so there will always be some irr tracking error in between the portfolio and the index in an index it is assumed that the dividend is paid on the ex dividend date and reinvested in the index however in a portfolio the divided does not come in until the dividend payment date and then it might take another day or so to reinvest so by default using irr the portfolio cannot match the irr of the index
4419087 for example if you start with 10 000 and then add 1 00 000 during a year there is a twr return calculation from the 10 000 contribution to the date the 1 000 000 was added then there is second calculation starting the day of the 1 000 000 contribution
4419088 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm

4419365 in no way is the presidents plan for in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it
4419366 in reality this project has no relation to the iranian missile threat but is aimed against russia
4419367 these installations only worsen the situation we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned
4419368 we do take very seriously the concerns of our ally
4419369 we would start with a battery under us command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles

4419409 i think this will be my last olympics not so much because i think im getting old and should stop but because there is just no other option for me

4419411 the rewards system for gps to treat particular conditions has worked but this hasnt included health problems older people particularly suffer from like depression falls and vision and hearing problems
4419412 these depressing results show that when it comes to healthcare all too often older people and the conditions that affect them come far down the pecking order
4419413 this kind of ageist treatment is precisely why legislation against age discrimination is needed
4419414 we know that many older people with osteoarthritis are often fobbed off by gps and told its your age youve got to live with it rather than being offered practical advice on weight loss exercise and pain relief or a referral to see a physiotherapist

4419458 we have to realise that while its good to play nice football there are times when you need to be dirty to win a game we have learned a lot recently one of the lessons is that sometimes you have to be tough when you are on the pitch that is part of football we dont have to be beautiful all the time
4419459 on wednesday night we didnt play good football certainly nowhere near our best but we won 2 0 and thats what it is all about
4419460 i didnt come here to make the cut ive got to do well to make my card and avoid the qualifying school

4419462 the british market is incredibly difficult to work in because the fees for players and their wages are so excessive we are hoping to bring in a couple of players in time for saturday we know we have to add more quality to the squad and we are working very very hard to do that
4419463 a lot of players enjoy being around the bigger clubs even if they arent in the team they enjoy the kudos and everything else that goes with it and dont fancy a battle at a club like stoke that is why we have to be very careful in attracting the right players and the right characters
4419464 the ioc does disapprove of any attempts to hinder a journalist who is going about doing his job seemingly within the rules and regulations

4419475 people often act without knowing why they do what they do
4419476 the fashion of political writing this year is to suggest that people choose their candidate by their stand on the issues but this strikes me as highly implausible
4419477 we have taken great strides to convince the enemy that we are not interested in the breadbasket
4419478 what has been happening in baquba and wajihiya specifically has been somewhat of a deception effort
4419479 we have allowed the enemy to believe that diyala has been wide open while we have been generating forces in here to nail them
4419480 thats why if you were to go up to an iraqi soldier on the street today or even some of their senior leaders and say so whats going on in diyala they might tell you something that doesnt quite sync with this plan
4419481 the intent of this operation is to hit them hard here make them defend and at the same time stop them from flowing to other places
4419482 to make them look in several different directions to affect not only their fighters but their leaders their financiers and their support base
4419483 so the united states is strengthening our longstanding security commitments with our friends in the gulf and rallying friends around the world to confront this danger before it is too late
4419484 answering questions about their past nuclear activities is a step
4419485 but they still need to suspend their enrichment and reprocessing activity another declaration is no substitute for complying with the u n sanctions

4419490 you cannot build trust when you hold an election where opposition candidates find themselves harassed or in prison

4419496 on the contrary he who takes upon himself the burden of his neighbour he who in whatsoever respect he may be superior is ready to benefit another who is deficient he who whatsoever things he has received from god by distributing these to the needy becomes a god to those who receive his benefits he is an imitator of god

4419501 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

4419510 a little more breathing room but there was also a fair amount of disappointment
4419511 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4419512 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4419513 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4419514 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth
4419515 the farmers would certainly prefer to have their fertilizer on the land rather than floating down the river
4419516 there have been many more reported but there truly are many more what has happened in the industrialized nations with agribusiness as well that led to increased flux of nutrients from the land to the estuaries and the seas is now happening in developing countries
4419517 now many of their estuaries and coastal seas are suffering the same malady
4419518 the increase is a troubling sign for estuarine and coastal waters which are among some of the most productive waters on the globe

4419530 la aceptaci n del r gimen de autonom a que se establece en el presente estatuto no implica renuncia del pueblo vasco a los derechos que como tal le hubieran podido corresponder en virtud de su historia que podr n ser actualizados de acuerdo con lo que establezca el ordenamiento jur dico
4419531 el proceso estatutario vasco y la reserva de los derechos hist ricos
4419532 su determinaci n de proseguir su labor pol tica firme y esperanzada por la consecuci n de un estatuto de autonom a que proporcione a euskadi los instrumentos m nimos para su autogobierno en el momento hist rico actual sin perjuicio de mantener sus reivindicaciones hist ricas y nacionales a trav s de las v as pol ticas
4419533 sin perjuicio de mantener sus reivindicaciones hist ricas y nacionales
4419534 el r gimen de autonom a que en este estatuto se establece no implica en ning n caso renuncia a los derechos hist ricos del pueblo vasco cuya plena realizaci n estriba en la restauraci n foral ntegra de su r gimen pol tico
4419535 nos hubiera gustado traer de la moncloa m s autonom a pero se ha tra do toda la que se ha podido en estos momentos dif ciles
4419536 deja abiertas las puertas para mayores exigencias una vez que nos demostremos a nosotros mismos que somos capaces de crear una administraci n y unos cuadros susceptibles de desarrollar las competencias transferidas
4419537 el estatuto de gernika es bueno mediano o malo pero es lo nico que tenemos al alcance de la mano para poder concienciar a nuestro pueblo para poder euskerizarlo para poder organizarlo y para poder decir aqu existe un pueblo en marcha hacia su libertad que sabe gobernarse y que aspira a otras cuotas de poder y de responsabilidad
4419538 el bai se volcar en pro del estatuto que aunque incompleto un nacionalista pide m s pone sobre el tapete esto que es algo y no lo otro que no es nada el bai ampl a horizontes porque tiene una carga poderosa de emoci n y realidad que nos permiten llegar hasta l mites que solamente con el estatuto es posible alcanzar y a n desde aqu seguir nuestra ruta hist rica hasta alcanzar la cota final en la que como nacionalistas y sabinianos estamos empe ados
4419539 una idea que ha estado presente en cuantas reivindicaciones de tipo auton mico hicieron nuestros mayores la aceptaci n de un determinado nivel de autonom a acorde con las circunstancias de todo tipo que imperan en cada momento pol tico nunca ha supuesto renuncia a los derechos que al pueblo vasco le corresponden en virtud de su historia y de su voluntad de autogobierno
4419540 la consideraci n de que los niveles auton micos que el estatuto contempla s lo son un anticipo a cuenta de los derechos que a euzkadi le corresponden y a los que no renuncia avala la importancia de esta disposici n adicional de cara a nuestro futuro como pueblo
4419541 desde los m s significativos de estos dirigentes y representantes hasta los m s modestos empiezan a decir que el estatuto vasco es un paso no es el final de un camino
4419542 para el pnv el estatuto no marca el techo de posibilidades auton micas lo acepta en la actual coyuntura pero aspira a ulteriores objetivos federales esta realidad resulta evidente
4419543 resulta fant stico mirar a tu alrededor y leer en lo saltar n de todos los ojos lo que quer an gritar los tuyos zorionak estatuto tenemos
4419544 a cualquier nacionalista vasco de cualquier color se le hace muy cuesta arriba la aceptaci n de una constituci n espa ola cualquiera que sea
4419545 la indisoluble unidad de la naci n espa ola patria com n e indivisible de todos los espa oles
4419546 un paso m s hacia la plena recuperaci n de sus plenos derechos nacionales
4419547 sin renuncia a tales derechos inalienables de modo especial el referido derecho de autodeterminaci n
4419548 la aprobaci n del presente estatuto no implica en ning n caso la renuncia de los derechos hist ricos de los territorios vascos
4419549 en el futuro el pueblo vasco alcance otras metas si lo desea
4419550 ciertas zonas de la izquierda radical vasca el estatuto es un pelda o no un fin
4419551 estatuto de autonom a que parte de la constituci n espa ola
4419552 este estatuto de autonom a no supone renuncia del pueblo vasco a ninguno de los derechos que como tal pueblo le corresponden y me parece que eso deja abierta la puerta a toda posibilidad yo siempre he defendido la autodeterminaci n de euskadi y la de los dem s pueblos del estado espa ol nosotros llegaremos a conseguir lo que el pueblo en su mayor a desea y si el pueblo en su mayor a desea la independencia y la separaci n del estado espa ol lo llegaremos a ver si es que tenemos tiempo para ello si tenemos vida para ello
4419553 el derecho de autodeterminaci n dec a no puede limitarse a decidir en un d a si el pueblo vasco desea la uni n o la separaci n aunque no hagamos dejaci n de este derecho el derecho de autodeterminaci n significa que en ltima instancia s lo el conjunto de los ciudadanos que constituyen el pueblo vasco puede decidir qu r gimen pol tico desea c mo articula su autogobierno y qu tipo de relaciones desea mantener con el estado espa ol y con otros estados afirmando esto es cuando debemos analizar lo que representa el estatuto de autonom a de gernika entre otras cosas por encima del acuerdo entre partidos vascos o entre el pueblo vasco y madrid representa un modo concreto de ejercicio de autodeterminaci n esta afirmaci n puede ser mal interpretada como de hecho ha sucedido como que el pa s vasco ya est por tanto autodeterminado y as lo han entendido quienes precisamente est n en contra del derecho de autodeterminaci n pero la nica interpretaci n posible es que el estatuto tiene en euskadi una legitimidad de la que carece la constituci n y que en cualquier caso y por distintos motivos el pueblo vasco cuando desee reformar el estatuto se hallar en su pleno derecho para plantear los distintos grados de autogobierno posibles
4419554 el reconocimiento constitucional del derecho de autodeterminaci n para las nacionalidades y pueblos del estado
4419555 s lo despu s de un proceso de normalizaci n nacional vasca
4419556 lo que necesitamos hoy es poder para euskadi con l en nuestras manos ma ana podremos reclamar con efectividad la autodeterminaci n y lo que es m s importante podremos ejercitarla
4419557 el presente estatuto norma institucional b sica en el actual periodo hist rico no supone por parte del pueblo vasco renuncia ni a sus derechos hist ricos ni a superiores formas de autogobierno que en el futuro puedan conseguirse superando las presentes limitaciones
4419558 no incluir en este estatuto un p rrafo en el que se afirme la voluntad vasca mil veces expresada de recuperaci n de sus derechos hist ricos o del puro derecho que como comunidad nacional le asiste ser a escribir un estatuto del que se excluir a a una parte fundamental de la comunidad vasca un estatuto en definitiva escrito contra ella
4419559 no es el mejor posible pero s es el mejor posible en este momento
4419560 pese al pie forzado de la constituci n el texto de gernika constituye la mejor de las f rmulas posibles
4419561 en el recelo que le suscita la pol tica gradualista del pnv ven en el estatuto un paso hacia el independentismo y hubieran deseado una redacci n m s clara y terminante que despejase el interpretacionismo coyuntural e interesado seg n esta ptica la unidad de espa a peligrar a seriamente tanto por el estatuto como por el car cter de las fuerzas pol ticas que lo apoyan sin reservas en el pa s vasco naturalmente las actitudes de los nacionalistas m s o menos escondidas y las abiertas de ciertos sectores de la izquierda radical confirman sus temores
4419562 para m lo m s grave es el principio que ha inspirado el estatuto y que tal como se sintetiza en el art culo 1 y en la disposici n adicional dibuja un r gimen provisional susceptible de patrocinar en el futuro m s radicales exigencias conjugados el art culo 1 del estatuto con la disposici n adicional queda configurado el ente auton mico como una nacionalidad que a trav s de la autonom a accede de momento a su autogobierno hasta que al pa s vasco le convenga actualizar sus derechos hist ricos en la medida en que lo crea oportuno es decir realidad de autogobierno hoy como camino a una posible independencia ma ana las cosas por desgracia son as y no vale la pena enga arse
4419563 en el bloque del pnv inserto en una manifestaci n unos j venes lt gt ostentan una pancarta que reza lt gt sin que el lt gt les d al menos p blicamente un palmetazo
4419564 el estatuto de guernica es el estatuto de los lt gt posibles en 1979 los lt gt se conseguir n cuando buenamente se pueda
4419565 hace que el estatuto sea una norma insegura y m s llena de sorpresas que la caja de pandora
4419566 hace que el estatuto sea una norma imprecisa abierta a futuras reivindicaciones que se presta a muchas sorpresas y lo peor de todo a una din mica de continuo enfrentamiento
4419567 me preocupa la disposici n adicional de manera importante y fundamental
4419568 era en grandes rasgos el italiano que a su vez se hab a inspirado en el espa ol de 1931 otero novas jos manuel nuestra democracia puede morir barcelona 1987 p g
4419569 un marco pol tico adecuado a rango de constituci n o a rango de estatuto para que se le conforme la mayor parte de autonom a posible alcanzable en cada momento
4419570 en este momento lo que m s se puede alcanzar y de cara al futuro a nada renuncio es conseguir un estatuto de autonom a y creo que se va a poder conseguir
4419571 todas las fuerzas pol ticas se han visto sorprendidas y han alabado su intervenci n en defensa de la disposici n adicional y de lo que ella significa a qu se debe esa actitud por su parte bueno desde luego pienso que a los socialistas no les ha hecho ni pizca de gracia de cualquier forma mi actitud favorable se debe a que pienso que hay que dejar una puerta abierta que permita seguir recuperando el grado de foralidad que nos fue arrebatado en su d a por otra parte hay que decir bien claro que la reivindicaci n foral nada tiene que ver con separatismo o el independentismo de ah que los hombres de la ucd del pa s vasco no queramos cargar con la responsabilidad de ser quienes cerremos el paso a esa leg tima aspiraci n que si bien ha sido defendida hasta hoy por nuestros padres y abuelos nosotros debemos ahora cultivarla para nuestros hijos y nietos
4419572 la autonom a no es un proceso est tico que culmina con la aprobaci n del estatuto de gernika
4419573 la disposici n adicional del estatuto que vamos a votar el pr ximo d a 25 dice claramente que el mismo
4419574 fundamentalmente dos errores uno dejar la puerta abierta a una revisi n en funci n de los derechos forales deja margen a interpretaciones arbitrarias y dos el tema de la caja de la seguridad social y la transferencia de competencias en la materia tampoco queda claro y da lugar a equ vocos
4419575 la culminaci n de la lucha nacional no puede darse por completa en el marco del estatuto que es la concreci n posible hoy de dicha libertad nacional

4419604 cluster bombs are indiscriminate killers that most nations have agreed to outlaw said marc garlasco senior military analyst at human rights watch in a statement
4419605 russias use of this weapon is not only deadly to civilians but also an insult to international efforts to avoid a global humanitarian disaster of the kind caused by landmines
4419606 this is the first known use of cluster munitions since 2006 during israels war with hezbollah in lebanon said the rights group
4419607 the level of growth of repossession orders suggests that we are on track for a repossession crisis very similar to the early 1990s
4419608 it is absolutely vital that the government should intervene and require a proper code of conduct to be implemented by mortgage lenders
4419609 this should not just apply to the big banks but to the large number of secondary lenders who are using court action to pursue their debts in a very aggressive way
4419610 they kept telling me how small it was but this is good
4419611 we invite a lot of parent innovations like volunteer art classes and we work as a team with the teachers
4419612 the gratuitous suggestion of a quid pro quo relationship would only serve to inflame the jury and create unfair prejudice against senator stevens
4419613 even if those staffers did not themselves testify before the grand jury it is equally problematic if fbi agents summarized testimony about protected information to the grand jury
4419614 yet the indictment does not describe the alleged falsity or concealment with any degree of specificity
4419615 these allegations are insufficient as a matter of law to provide senator stevens with fair notice of the charges against him or to ensure that the grand jury properly returned an indictment in this matter
4419616 he is constitutionally owed a statement of the specific charges against him a requirement not satisfied by a recitation of facts followed by general allegations
4419617 although stevens knowingly carried debt on a 31 000 interest free loan from his personal friend for more than 10 months during 2001 stevens did not list such a liability on his 2001 disclosure form
4419618 allen offered to get stevens daughter a new car in exchange for the 1999 land rover and stevens agreed
4419619 for the purpose of hiding allens involvement in the transaction
4419620 i saw sen stevens at lunch and he asked if you im not sure why he mentioned it to me but he asked me to i think find out if you had any business contacts in phoenix with respect to his son who is down there who finds himself without a job at this point
4419621 stevens son accepted the position with veco and also received a personal loan from allen
4419622 im gonna try to see if i can get some bigwigs from back here to go up there and say look uh you just gotta make up your mind you gotta get this done

4419696 there is a strong us dollar theme across markets building momentum from the day before
4419697 i believe this is the beginning of a us dollar correction of the major move lower so the next three to six months is bullish for the dollar
4419698 for asia it will ebb and flow between different currencies those ahead of the curve on inflation will perform better in the long term those behind and with deficits will suffer

4419716 the only thing is that im not confident with how the game ended
4419717 i lost my second baseman when the pitcher pedro luis lazo threw the ball at his head i dont see any place for that in baseball i respect the way cuba plays baseball but i dont like losing players
4419718 it takes all the work out of baseball because all you need is a base hit and youve got a good shot to win
4419719 normally you get a guy on first and battle to get home it was strange running out to second from the dugout ive never done that in my life and probably never will again

4419721 what happened today is good but im going to leave it behind me and know that tomorrow we all start at zero
4419722 prelims is typically challenging because its so long and youre spending a lot of time sitting and waiting
4419723 sometimes you can get fatigued or tight or lose your momentum
4419724 i definitely felt a little bit of that because i was sharper at the beginning than towards the end but the fact i could maintain my consistency was a positive thing for me
4419725 i knew yesterday i was going for it and that no one was going to take it away from me

4419734 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4419735 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4419736 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4419737 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4419738 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty
4419739 i accuse the russian government of ethnic cleansing and i can prove it with the help of international organizations
4419740 in front of the eyes of mankind russian troops are committing ethnic cleansing and i can do nothing about it
4419741 i am deeply concerned by the notion that russia has a say or some control over a country outside of its border
4419742 the department of defense will re examine the entire gamut of our military activities with russia and will make changes as necessary and appropriate depending on russian action in the days ahead
4419743 if russia does not stop back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russia relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4419744 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4419745 the situation here is indeed tense and we have reports about the movement of the russian troops almost every hour and theres no discernable pattern other than they are not withdrawing just yet
4419746 it started out ok but that soon gave way to small sporadic shootings and fires in the provincial town of gori the georgian population and leaders are very much concerned about the situation
4419747 russia has not taken the right steps and is not following its commitment
4419748 james the only difference between the russian action on its border and the us action on its southern border is that the russian military is actually competent and effective
4419749 mhr i am actually on russia side on this one they are defending an tiny province that are considering to join russia georgia invaded this tiny province so what do you think
4419750 i came in on a tank and only a tank will remove me
4419751 what nation is powerful enough on the world stage to intervene in the aggression shown by russia
4419752 this is a very worrisome development it really indicates a soviet era mentality and i think its something all democratic countries should speak out strongly against i hope russia will reconsider its actions
4419753 you cant be my friend if you are his friend
4419754 the only difference between the russian action on its border and the us action on its southern border is that the russian military is actually competent and effective

4419766 studies of mouse skin cancer have contributed little to our understanding of human skin cancer
4419767 for instance it is well known that many agents that cause skin cancer in mice do not do so in man indeed some of these agents are used as therapies
4419768 when contrasted with the known biology of human skin cancer and the pattern of human skin cream use it seems to me extraordinarily unlikely that the presented results have any clinical relevance
4419769 being alive proven to cause death according to leading scientists
4419770 studies of mouse skin cancer have contributed little to our understanding of human skin cancer

4419772 the fact that the bsct psychologist now apparently recognizes that her conduct was criminal in nature is very significant
4419773 we have alleged based on classified government records that the bsct psychologists recommendation led directly to the illegal abuse and inhumane treatment of mohammad jawad this invocation of the right to remain silent seems to confirm that
4419774 the evidence in this case confirms our worst fears that military psychologists are working to break down detainees psyches
4419775 todays developments only confirms our view that a full accounting of the shadowy bsct program is long overdue
4419776 the continuing silence of the apa on member involvement in torture is telling
4419777 no apa leader or official has ever uttered one word critical of actual u s abuse or of the role of psychologists and psychological expertise in that abuse they continue to stonewall on disciplining any psychologists who participated despite promises to investigate
4419778 to identify weaknesses in detainees that can be exploited to break them down psychologically and render them dependent upon the interrogators
4419779 in the eyes of the world psychologists are being seen as aiders and abettors of torture the damage to the profession grows day by day and the shamefulness of it reflects on all of us whether we like it or not
4419780 what has this country come to when a licensed psychologist a senior officer in the u s armed forces someone trained in the art of healing broken hearts and mending broken minds someone with a duty to do no harm turns her years of training and education to the art of breaking people to the intentional devastation of a lonely homesick teenage boy

4419815 teams do fear us again because of the results weve had and when we have given a good account of ourselves against the likes of italy and france but we now need to take that into the next campaign especially at home our form at hampden over the last couple of years has not always been great while our away form has always been decent

4419833 georgias territorial integrity and the withdrawal of the occupation army must be the main objectives to be pursued by the international community after military actions are discontinued
4419834 serious mistakes can be made that have to be paid for a long time afterwards
4419835 there has been an intensification of russian military activity in the south ossetian region
4419836 military operations against georgian forces in the conflict zone have escalated dramatically
4419837 russia has been attacking villages and cities elsewhere in georgia including threatening the zug didi region and air attacks against tbilisis airport russian military attacks have also destroyed critical georgian infrastructure including seaports airports and other facilities
4419838 t he result of this escalation against a sovereign state that has not posed direct threat to russia has increased casualties and humanitarian suffering for the people of georgia including in south ossetia and abkhazia
4419839 offered a cease fire and restoration of the status quo
4419840 russia continues to resist efforts by the international community to mediate this conflict
4419841 w e must condemn the russian military assault in sic the sovereign state of georgia the violation of the countries sic sovereignty and territorial integrity including the targeting of civilians and the campaign of terror against the georgian population similarly we need to condemn the destruction of georgian infrastructure and violations of the countrys sovereignty and territorial integrity
4419842 was russias objective regime change in georgia the overthrow of the democratically elected government of that country
4419843 it is not a part of our political culture or foreign policy to topple anyone or put someone on a throne

4419876 one place it is not going to go is the sec frankly there has never been evidence that the sec has the tools or the culture to deal with market stability issues it has an enforcement culture with strengths in fraud company filings and disclosure rules
4419877 as the credit crunch has unfolded the sec has looked superfluous partly that is because of its remit but partly it is because of the natural hesitancy and reticence of christopher cox and his senior advisers about what is the proper role of governments in markets they believe in letting institutions shake out hank paulson us treasury secretary and mr bernanke have proven themselves survivalists who have been able to overcome their predilection towards market forces

4419879 well not right now i was looking for that earlier
4419880 i love you too but im gonna mace you in the face
4419881 let me think about that ill tell you the next time i see you
4419882 shes been disappearing all our lives we were raised to be treated like that
4419883 i guess i still got some more healing to do
4419884 is life always this hard or is it just when youre a kid
4419885 its much more difficult than previous years when there were bigger motifs
4419886 in accordance with law police plans to shorten their stay in china and deport them under escort
4419887 everybody in china knows that tibet is an inalienable part of the territory of china
4419888 most of the people in the demonstrations are non chinese and i would conclude that they really dont know very much about this situation
4419889 this is an important agreement for the security of the united states for the security of poland and the security of our nato allies
4419890 in no way is the presidents plan for in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it
4419891 in reality this project has no relation to the iranian missile threat but is aimed against russia
4419892 these installations only worsen the situation we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned
4419893 we do take very seriously the concerns of our ally
4419894 we would start with a battery under us command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles
4419895 in five seven or 10 years we want to be sufficiently well equipped and well trained to be ready both with our allies but by ourselves to defend ourselves at a critical moment
4419896 committed to close cooperation with poland in the event of a danger from a third party
4419897 a new element to take our security agreement to a new level
4419898 i have no indication that russias invasion of georgia at all influenced the negotiations but who knows you can draw your own conclusions
4419899 were facing a new international situation the situation doesnt change our arguments but in my view reinforces them
4419900 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4419901 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4419902 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4419903 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4419904 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty
4419905 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4419906 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4419907 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4419908 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4419909 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4419910 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4419911 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4419912 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4419913 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4419914 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide
4419915 im putting this question forward im putting the evidence forward voters can make up their own minds
4419916 wait why isnt the swim over yet its supposed to be fast
4419917 the money is already in place we worked out that modernisation would cost 3 million around the same amount of money it would cost for a complete rebuild
4419918 if the plans are approved subject to the land being available from culture and leisure the new crematorium will be constructed next to the current building which will remain open while the new facility is built
4419919 this means that there will be no closures for refurbishment work which would have been unavoidable if we had gone for an upgrade
4419920 rushall olympic saw the story about our situation in the express amp star and got in touch to see if they could help
4419921 we held a meeting with people from the club and managed to get everything sorted out so now well have a new home near a canal
4419922 everyone was quite worried about what we were going to do because obviously we didnt have much time to find somewhere else but the club has been very generous and we cant thank them enough
4419923 we saw the story in the paper and thought we might be able to help
4419924 obviously they were in a difficult situation so were really pleased that were in position to do something
4419925 weve even had people whose gardens back on to a canal calling to see if they can help
4419926 presumably these thefts are linked to the increase in the value of scrap metal but how low can people stoop
4419927 not only do these thefts cost the police in terms of having to replace the signs but they add to the distress of the victims families
4419928 it is disgusting that mindless thieves are stooping this low for scrap metal with most of them striking at night there is an increasing worry that pedestrians cyclists and even cars may not see the approaching danger

4419930 i found science in something that i think is fun so you can find science in things that you think is fun and in doing that you will learn that science is fun
4419931 a tv reality show based purely on indian classical dances would i believe go a long way in promoting these dance forms
4419932 you can have young dancers from indias west north south east competing in such a show this will definitely go a long way in popularising indian classical dances among the new generation
4419933 if you really have a genuine passion for something then dont let anything get in the way
4419934 there are other things you can catch up with later in your life but know yourself and who you are and if something is important to you stick at it
4419935 when i first wanted to play cricket for england i didnt think about being the first sikh to do so
4419936 at first it wasnt a dream that looked like coming true
4419937 whatever opportunities you are given you should take them and i went there had fun and my interest grew
4419938 i used to bowl for hours on end to try to get it right
4419939 we are happy that we were able to find a window during the first week of december for the inaugural edition of the champions league twenty20
4419940 there was a gap in between the one day internationals and tests in india against the touring england squad which will enable both the rajasthan royals and the chennai super kings the ipl finalists to regroup and focus on the inaugural edition of the champions league twenty20
4419941 but we have assured them of the best security arrangements for the players officials and other stakeholders during the tournament at the stadiums hotels and wherever they move around
4419942 we have told all stakeholders that security will be tight during the champions trophy but if something happens elsewhere in the city we cant give any guarantees for that cricket has been played in cities where bomb blasts have taken place at the same time
4419943 i dont think these recent blasts should influence anyones thinking as far as cricket is concerned nothing has ever happened in our sphere
4419944 i dont think the task force is submitting any report but their job is to go and assure the teams about the arrangements and preparations for the tournament
4419945 as far as we know no team has withdrawn from the champions trophy as yet
4419946 we want to ensure that all champions trophy matches attract sizeable crowds and would take all possible measures for it we will consult with the icc and try lowering the ticket prices
4419947 it is not a question of maintaining a balance between classical and hindi film dances i think my training in classical dances has actually helped me in all the filmi jhatkas and matkas
4419948 when i was young i was always interested in football and stuff like that but mother always wanted me to learn classical dance
4419949 when i initially tried bharatanatyam i found it very tough the movements it was just very tough for me it was later when i saw odissi performances by protima bedi on tv that i thought that it was more like it for me
4419950 why cricket no team sports should be allowed in the olympics
4419951 in a team of 11 players nine might be working hard but the other two might not this is not in line with the spirit of olympics
4419952 while joining the independence celebrations with the people of india we also remember all those who made sacrifices during the freedom struggles
4419953 it is a matter of pride that top international players from the west indies and bermuda will be playing for the first time in canada
4419954 players will be gearing their game towards the twenty20 more than the five day format
4419955 the new generation of 15 20 year olds are they going to gear themselves towards travelling the world for nine months of the year playing five day cricket or earn plenty by playing three hour cricket a little bit in india and at home i m not too sure
4419956 suppose youre a young player and you suddenly come into the england team now and within the first year you play two stanfords and earn one million pounds and get an ipl deal where s it going to go to
4419957 its always hard going to india you really need to go there and familiarise yourself with the country the wickets and the conditions said clark
4419958 it s all good and well to train here but the conditions are so different sometimes that if we go a few days early that wouldn t bother me because i think it will be very important for my preparation to get acclimatised to those conditions
4419959 were looking at it at the moment the champions trophy is still going ahead so we can only plan as if that is going to happen
4419960 while it is disappointing not to have ricky ponting available we are confident continuing his recovery and missing this series will assure ricky is ready for the demanding cricket schedule ahead for the australian team
4419961 matthew hayden has been selected in this side subject to fitness his progress has been monitored closely by our physiotherapist and doctor and his overall participation in the series will be determined as we get closer to the date
4419962 he is on track to be available for upcoming cricket
4419963 matthew hayden is progressing well with his rehabilitation following an achilles tendon injury his availability for the series will be determined over the next two weeks
4419964 i remember there used to be flag hoisting in my school i attended the function for 14 years from nursery to class xii we used to celebrate that we also used to get a box of sweets
4419965 there were lots of people who walked on and then there was a long fight and after that we got independence
4419966 that is a moment of freedom which we should enjoy in reality we realise what its importance was we should remember those who contributed for the independence of the country people lost their lives for it we have to recall every thing
4419967 amcs standing committee today cleared the proposal to lease the stadium to icl for ten years with rs 12 lakh per year icl matches will be played here in two phases during october and november and then in february and march
4419968 a total of 20 matches will be played every year and icl will be responsible for the maintenance of the stadium
4419969 icl will also refurbish the stadium at the cost of rs 10 crore over the next one and half years they will be putting up flood lights chairs for spectators build pavillions etc
4419970 except for the four months of icl season amc will have the stadium at its disposal for other sports activities
4419971 we are still planning the schedule for matches to be conducted in ahmedabad but icl matches will be played at sardar patel stadium from this season itself
4419972 by pushing back departments and restructuring first class cricket the board has committed a grave mistake we were on top of the world in 1992 and 1999 because we followed the departmental cricket system
4419973 we need to follow the same system we used in the past and support departmental cricket since that system has been abolished quality players have stopped coming up
4419974 in regional cricket there is disparity between the teams in terms of players strength and that is harming our domestic cricket we have to revert back to promoting departmental cricket or we will not be able to produce players of the caliber of a javed miandad or wasim akram
4419975 we should promote regional cricket but at the same time need to enhance status of departmental cricket there should be competition between the two
4419976 what is of concern is that in last two years we have not played a series to our potential we do win one match here and there but not a full fledged series and this is a very serious issue
4419977 the board is involving former players at the coaching level and in some administrative positions but by and large there is a need to have senior player involved in the running of the game in the country
4419978 were sorry we are currently experiencing issues please try your call again later
4419979 when we first heard about the opportunity to develop a game based on the original carrier command we were instantly hooked
4419980 for us carrier command was not only one of the most innovative games we had ever played but it is also one of the very few games that truly influenced our gaming tastes and motivated us in our own home grown game development which later materialized in the form of operation flashpoint with similar open ended gameplay and emphasis on a deeply simulated game world
4419981 having the opportunity to create an actual carrier command game is not only a great honor for us but it also allows us to take the legendary title we all love and do it justice with a truly next gen rendition

4419988 dieser tag geht als der verr ckteste meines lebens in die geschichte ein nach dem ersten lauf hatte ich meine medaillenhoffnungen bereits begraben nach dem riesenfehler sagte ich mir das wars jetzt vio jetzt brauchst du neue ziele nach dem ersten lauf habe ich geweint denn daf r hatte ich nicht vier jahre lang hart gearbeitet doch der heli ehemann helmut anm hat gesagt dass ich mich zusammenrei en soll er ist da immer sehr rational vor dem zweiten lauf war ich nur mehr leer im kopf aber dann habe ich die fans gesehen die zur strecke gekommen sind auch die sterreichischen schwimmer das hat mich sehr gefreut ich wollte den leuten eine gute show bieten gerechnet habe ich mit gar nichts mehr und im zweiten lauf sind mir wieder zwei fehler passiert im ziel habe ich nie gedacht dass es reichen k nnte die herz operation vor olympia habe ich verheimlicht weil die situation sehr schwierig war die gefahr war zu gro dass damit politik betrieben wird
4419989 violetta oblinger peters hat gezeigt dass sie im wildwasser zur absoluten weltspitze z hlt sie hat heute eine hervorragende leistung im olympischen wildwasser kanal von shunyi erbracht dieser kanal wurde von den olympioniken im vorfeld als der schwierigste k nstliche kanal den sie je erlebt hatten bezeichnet doch die ehrgeizige violetta aus ober sterreich schaffte dank ihrer top form die sensation und holte bronze f r sterreich herzlichen gl ckwunsch
4419990 this very gold medal is dedicated to the people of my motherland
4419991 it is also dedicated to my dear mother who passed away not a long time ago
4419992 both she and evstyukhina praised cao admitting they didnt stand a chance against the chinese strongwoman
4419993 i was sure that i didnt have a real chance to compete with cao and thats what happened
