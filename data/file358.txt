3580000 we should be proud of what we do for all for america for the joint
3580001 trust must be earned yet the american public trusts those in uniform we will show ourselves worthy of the sacred trust our leaders our joint brethren and the american people place in us because this business is all about trust
3580002 what most people dont know is that general schwartz and i have something in common both of us were planning to retire
3580003 i thought washington d c was in my rearview mirror 15 years ago but circumstances changed and here i am today able to do unto others what others have done to me
3580004 general schwartzs leadership qualities make him the right man at the right time for this job
3580005 he is one who has lived the core values of airmen and women integrity first service before self and excellence in all we do
3580006 we are grateful shes at his side to continue to improve the lives of our airmen
3580007 the air force goes to great lengths to ensure our pilots and those of the civilian aviation community are on the same sheet of music when it comes to flight safety because we share the same skies
3580008 our attendance during this event and our promotion of the seeandavoid org web site is our way of showing that we are committed to working with civilian aviators to improve flight safety within our community
3580009 its an attention getter as well as making a statement that you should always consider military airspace when planning your flights
3580010 the air force could not have chosen a better venue to get the word out about flight safety
3580011 and i am proud to be here as part of our shared communities of civilian and military aviators
3580012 prior to this change retirees had to have 20 years of active duty service or be retired at age 60 from the guard or reserve
3580013 if you didnt have 20 years you werent eligible however with the ndaa expansion if you are medically retired either permanently or temporarily and you have va payments that reduce your retirement pay you are eligible to apply for crsc
3580014 that way if you do not qualify and something in the law or department of defense crsc policy changes in the future that could affect the prior decision like the 2008 ndaa we will already have a claim and documentation and can reassess a claim based on the new eligibility factors
3580015 if you answered yes to those questions and have not submitted your crsc claim you should do so
3580016 the money is tax free and could help pay medical expenses or improve your quality of life
3580017 im honored for the opportunity to talk to the secretary of the air force
3580018 im glad he took the time to show he cares about me and other veterans
3580019 the air force is grateful to the greater community here and the communities across the river in iowa for being such gracious hosts this week especially as we celebrate all things air force in this area
3580020 your encouragement to our air force members and defense department civilians and their families make a noticeable difference in their quality of life
3580021 we are a more expeditionary air force deployed to dozens of places across the globe
3580022 we are a more coherent force with total force integration and joint teams with no difference between our active guard and reserve components when the air force deploys to the fight were also a force that has made great strides in operational effectiveness by leveraging new technologies in unmanned aerial systems and reach back capabilities through our satellite networks
3580023 we are also a force however that de emphasized the nuclear deterrence mission more than we might have intended to
3580024 but were working hard to bring vigor attention and focus to this all important mission the recent published national defense strategy that defense secretary robert m gates released just last week reiterates our nations commitment to maintaining our nuclear arsenal as our primary deterrent to nuclear attack for decades our intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear bomber force have served as a part of a strategic backstop of americas deterrent posture this is a mission that we take seriously and it has held my utmost attention since the first day i assumed office
3580025 the task force will develop a draft road map for our nuclear enterprise by the end of september
3580026 we will then pause to assess our progress and also to incorporate the recommendations from a panel recently established by the secretary of defense after weve incorporated those results gen norton a schwartz the air force chief of staff and i will gather the air force senior leadership and finalize our way ahead for our nuclear enterprise im pleased with the progress weve made thus far and i look forward to sharing the results as we move forward to strengthen our performance in this important mission
3580027 we must maintain our focus on current operations and at the same time plan for future threats
3580028 the air force is maintaining aging fleets while simultaneously recapitalizing and attempting to increase procurement of new aircraft and satellites we are migrating funding from supplement appropriations into the regular air force budget at the same time we are managing rising operational costs for personnel medical care and fuel were meeting new mission requirements intelligence surveillance reconnaissance space and the cyber world while at the same time we are getting ready to transition into a new administration next year we need to look at these challenges from an enterprise perspective to achieve the appropriate balance necessary for the air force
3580029 the importance of our core values has not changed nor has the high quality of the airmen attracted to military service
3580030 we remain a force of motivated and dedicated personnel their families are devoted to their country and express great pride in their sons and daughters and husbands and wives in uniform we remain a force that is fully committed to winning todays joint fight preparing for tomorrows emerging national security challenges and leaning forward to care for our people our families and our wounded warriors
3580031 they brought us all to a high school gym somewhere i think that they figured that pistol pete was going to win it vitalis was the sponsor and they made a deal with pistol to do the tv commercials for the event but he didnt win he got knocked out just before the finals jo jo white and i ended up playing in the finals after beating white they gave me a vitalis trophy and a satchel that contained about 15 000 i remember unzipping it and pretending that i was tossing the money out to the fans
3580032 you never want to see a guy be out you want to have him out there playing each and every day and i know madieu wants to be out there because he loves to play football and hes that type of competitor
3580033 but in saying that its the nature of the nfl the nature of playing football guys are going to get hurt
3580034 what did i see in the newspaper four weeks five weeks six weeks we just dont know i dont know im not clairvoyant
3580035 all i have to do is just learn a few things about the free safety and ill jump right in there if they need me to
3580036 its been tough its just a mental strain because there are so many plays and so many gaps youve got to remember on every play
3580037 with what we like to do we have to make sure everyone is in a certain area and you have a certain area you have to cover
3580038 thats probably the main thing being a star player in college a lot of times youre asked to do a lot more things here in the nfl with the defense that we have you just need to do your job and everything will take care of itself
3580039 even though it hasnt been take it to the ground and its a soft training camp theres a lot of banging that goes on out there
3580040 you guys want to select one and well put him in just shoulder pads out here and come out for a 9 on 7 someday
3580041 you guys go ahead you need to sign a waiver and id be happy to put you out there in the 9 on 7 and then you could comment afterward on if you think its soft or not
3580042 i dont know about hysterically funny but i am probably a and b i go back to all of the comments about chester taylor in 2006 that said he is not going to be the answer and 2 3 yards per carry in the preseason and then we go about two games in the season and its hes going to set a franchise record for carries and well wear him down at this pace no you have to write what you see so i mean if thats how you see it
3580043 ive got a number in my head of how many he needs to have
3580044 he and i have talked about that he knew full well what he was charged with going into the first game and like i said he gets plenty of work out here in the inside drills
3580045 obviously when you miss two weeks of practice its not where you want it to be
3580046 theres only so much you can do on the elliptical machines thats just part of getting back from an injury ive missed a lot of time ive got some catching up to do
3580047 were always saying gus has been in the league 15 years its crazy because hes still out here doing the same thing were doing were excited for him
3580048 for the first time the packer legend answers all the questions the world has been asking for weeks and you will only see it here
3580049 in the past few decades individuals have experienced dramatic changes in some of the most established dimensions of human life time space matter and individuality

3580051 the increase in oil and commodity prices is damaging corporate profits
3580052 its very hard for the boj to move despite the increase in prices
3580053 the boj is concerned about the downside risks to overall
3580054 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3580055 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3580056 i dont even know what fred was saying half the time we need a real translator for that from the u n
3580057 maybe two years ago when i didnt have anything really ailing me its always good when you dont have to go in the shop as we like to say
3580058 he has had a total healthy offseason now he has an opportunity and you can tell
3580059 youve always said theres more than one way to skin a cat coach gibbs has his own way and coach zorn has his own way
3580060 coach zorn definitely has a very positive attitude i think that trickles down to the team
3580061 and put two or three guys on andre and jason
3580062 i dont know if theyll need me to do it at all but if they need me ill be ready but if they dont im fine with that
3580063 we have redefined our business by investing to create competitive advantages and this value differentiation strategy underpinned by our customer centric transformation sets us apart
3580064 the six party talks have entered a new phase but japan is behaving ridiculously
3580065 she has proven to be brilliant so maybe its gonna be fabulous
3580066 i still believe that we need to establish a bipartisan truman committee with subpoena power to exercise the oversight that these abuses demand
3580067 i pulled a muscle in the first game and it was getting worse and worse and worse
3580068 it was maybe a little more frustrating this time having played him last week and winning fairly easily
3580069 man 4e rogues are made out of 50 awesome 50 win and 50 badass
3580070 gnomes on the other hand are smurf like things with beards that sit with fishing rods in the gardens of people who dont know the meaning of taste
3580071 another comment like that and youll be wearing your ass as a hat
3580072 yang pentingkan jalan dan sudah sesuai dengan bisnis proses yang diinginkan
3580073 it solidifies us as the place to go for the cool stuff
3580074 i think probably the kids may not know exactly how important it is but i think every parent knows how important it is for a child to feel like they have something to be successful with
3580075 i hope the british board of film classification bbfc will view this with concern and decide it should not be granted a classification
3580076 freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one
3580077 in all things of nature there is something of the marvelous
3580078 over 1 300 cancer patients have been left to die in the past 20 months because they were not deemed exceptional enough to receive cancer treatment on the nhs they will have been forced either to go without the life giving treatments or to pay privately for the top up drugs and risk having all their other care withdrawn
3580079 the nhs should be available to all who need it yet 1 300 cancer patients were denied the treatment that could have made all the difference to them thousands of cancer patients have been forced to plead for their lives
3580080 there is a powerful human impulse known as the rule of rescue to attempt to help an identifiable person whose life is in danger no matter how much it costs
3580081 nice recognises that when it is making its decisions it should consider the needs of present and future patients of the nhs who are anonymous and who do not necessarily have people to argue their case on their behalf the institute has not therefore adopted an additional rule of rescue
3580082 we would be opposed to ignoring a rule of rescue when it introduces a degree of flexibility around extreme cases so what if you waste a few pounds if you are doing your best for humanity
3580083 obviously its a long ways away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the u s
3580084 i think i play one of my best matches in the last weeks on hard court
3580085 ive never played singles at the olympics so this has been really cool for me
3580086 every time i walk out there its like im playing in my match but at the same time i have the whole u s team on my side its good i really like that feeling
3580087 and hopefully some of us will hear the national anthem at the end of the week
3580088 its hard to train for singles and always dealing with swelling ive just really been playing careful with it i really wanted to be here in whatever capacity it was and it became painfully obvious to me that role was doubles i was very happy to accept that and move forward
3580089 but with the time difference im still waking up like at 5 in the morning so its good i like the early matches
3580090 my way of improving on it is to keep it up
3580091 i played really clean matches in the past the next one would be kind of streaky i dont want to do that any more i just want to keep playing the same consistency
3580092 i felt like any time that i needed to serve well i did if i was down love 30 or a 30 all point
3580093 thats good for me going on in the later rounds that im tough on my serve
3580094 and we who with unveiled faces all reflect the lords glory are being transformed into his likeness with ever increasing glory which comes from the lord who is the spirit
3580095 i just think its a tragedy for this region its a tragedy for young players and for all the aspiration thats out there
3580096 if any of these guys have an aspiration to play at a higher level than heartland rugby then theyre going to have to move away arent they we could be talking about 20 to 30 players and that to me is the sad part of it all
3580097 were getting told the third week into this competition that were not going to be there next season that alone is a distraction the players will have a lot on their minds where is their future where is their career going to be
3580098 i dont think a lot of good comes out of negative motivation and weve got a really good team here weve got really good people here and we just need to keep our pride and our dignity thats something theyll never be able to take away from us
3580099 id like to stay in the crusaders environment so canterbury is probably the only place to go
3580100 things were just starting to roll along quite well now and now its been taken away from all the players and the younger guys who are coming up weve got a few new guys in the team this year and theres a lot of good talent around the tasman region
3580101 im not too sure what im going to be doing next season because i head over to the uk after the air new zealand cup so i wont be making any decisions until january or february
3580102 it doesnt really give the kids in this region and upcoming talent anything to aspire to its a shame really but we cant do a hell of a lot about it weve just got to keep playing
3580103 which is a pity because i dont really want to go anywhere else
3580104 ive just got to keep playing and hopefully get an opportunity somewhere else
3580105 but im pretty gutted to be honest im really enjoying this place
3580106 if you dropped one egg while cooking would you throw the whole dozen on the floor
3580107 the defense set the tone right away took control out there
3580108 its a veteran bunch they have been playing together two three years now with all but a couple of exceptions and they definitely got the better of it tonight
3580109 it wasnt pretty and there were a lot of mistakes but the effort was real good the intensity was good and we just have a lot of young guys who are still trying to figure it out
3580110 well look at the tape and hopefully learn a lot between now and saturday morning
3580111 it happened because there was a group of people who demanded it must happen and because tens of thousands of our fellow citizens agreed that it must
3580112 it will always mean more to me than i can ever adequately express
3580113 within japan there are little excesses in employment capacity and corporate leverage
3580114 we do not see elements in the economy that would push the japanese economy into a deeper recession
3580115 kejayaan islam itu gak bisa dibangun sendirian jangan pikir sebuah gerakan h bisa mengatasi semua rintangan dawah sendirian gak mungkin kita rekrut semuanya tiap gerakan punya cara khas masing2 untuk merekrut semuanya fastabiqul khoirot insya allah tergantung individu yang beda2 itu cocoknya kemana

3580121 dek kenapa kamu tadi ngomong gitu kaget ya mbak salafy sekarang
3580122 ehm gak kaget kok mbak arin mah biasa aja jujur arin gak terlalu mempermasalahkan urusan manhaj bahkan arin gak mau ngurusin arin manhaj apa sekarang yang penting arin islam dan mencoba untuk kaffah dalam islam
3580123 ya arin emang manhaj im mbak arin rutin liqo pro im tapi arin kadang ngaji salafy juga kok mbak dalam sebulan ada kali arin ikut 1 2 kali kajian salafy sama temen temen kalo lagi berkutat di komputer juga seringkali arin denger ceramah salafy kok arin ngumpulin mp3 nya malah kadang juga kalo dapet info ada kajian jt arin ikutan juga
3580124 lah kenapa gak bisa gitu mbak saya tholabul ilmi saya ambil yang baik2 dari semua manhaj itu apa itu salah kan allah yang menilai
3580125 bukan seperti itu memang pada intinya kita tidak mempermasalahkan manhaj tapi ketika masing2 manhaj itu digabungkan maka ada terlihat bahwa masing2 manhaj itu berbeda dan ada satu yang paling benar
3580126 hmm gitu yah afwan mbak ok ok hehe kali ini urgent banget harus off mbak bye afwan dah dulu ya wassalamualaikum d
3580127 yeah im heading home now oh yeah i got married

3580129 ferns dont have pricklers like cactuses but what if they all ganged up on you tried to choke you in your sleep

3580131 now i aint saying shes a gold digger but she aint messing with no broke
3580132 saya menangis karena saya bahagia bahagia krena tuhan yesus telah menyelamatkan anak saya
3580133 terus terang dia anak manja tapi saya hargai dia bisa tidur di tempat yang begitu
3580134 sayalah yang bertanggung jawab saya merasa tidak dan bukan ibu yang baik
3580135 saya nggak boleh egois saya punya penggemar toh video klip saya beredar di mana mana dengan baju terbuka juga
3580136 im not the least ashamed of being almost 50 because i know i dont look it id like to think my physical fitness and my health consciousness would inspire more people once they know how old i actually i am therefore yes i can say proudly i am 47 and almost 50
3580137 when i see 60 year old folks in my building working out taking care of themselves and looking out for their diet i feel very proud somewhere id like to think i pioneered a movement towards staying healthy and fit in people around me
3580138 i brought it in with a dinner with my wife two kids and my parents they insisted on a cake and all i was embarrassed but of course pleased thank god for family yaar
3580139 on monday i planned to head to our home in lonavala for the day but it got so rainy that we just decided to stay home and spend my birthday indoors chatting eating playing games i cant think of a better way to spend my birthday
3580140 i pigged the whole day my wife mana was aghast i told her to chill because i intend to go on an even stricter food regime after my birthday
3580141 there were some scenes that we thought to be too dangerous but she insisted on doing away with the body double and also the wirings
3580142 shes very athletic it runs in her family then there was akshay kumar to inspire her akshay had done so much on screen action it was a novel experience for deepika and she sailed through the action she worked really hard to get the posture and power in the action scenes those whove seen her in om shanti om will be shocked
3580143 the films flavour comes from akshays real life hes a boy from chandni chowk in old delhi who went to bangkok as a cook my writer sridhar raghavan wrote the role with akshays real life story in mind
3580144 the characters personality comes alive through akshay thanks to him we finished ahead of schedule
3580145 chandni chowk to china is a childrens film i dont think kids will try to attempt to climb the nearest wall to fight after watching the film but well have lots of kids joining karate classes
3580146 before i started making this film my interest in the martial arts was restricted to jackie chan et li bruce lee and the crouching tigers of the world but akshay brought out the hidden dragon in me
3580147 he made me watch a lot of action scenes before we left for china hed make me sit down every morning and make me watch one kung fu film and explain the subtexts by the time we left to shoot i understood the martial arts much better
3580148 cause when you run youd sink and youd really never get to the base
3580149 its hard to look at now and its a lot of work getting it ready every year now to have to do it twice
3580150 we were about to start fall ball in a couple of weeks i guess we have to cancel it and send our kids to other leagues
3580151 a new musical lovingly ripped off from the motion picture monty python and the holy grail
3580152 we then captured mens body odour by asking them to wear t shirts to bed for two consecutive nights
3580153 we tried to control as far as we could for non body smells so our men were non smokers used non perfumed soap to wash and avoided smoky bars strong smelling foods and deodorants
3580154 our study shows for the first time that the pill actually shifts preferences towards genetically similar men
3580155 if pill use increases the chance of selecting a more genetically similar partner than a woman would otherwise choose then when the woman comes off the pill to start a family she may find it harder to conceive
3580156 one charge of culpable driving causing death and two counts of culpable driving negligently causing grievous bodily harm
3580157 ahmed alzaabi to plead guilty but not on the booze
3580158 presumably that will save him having to apply for asylum here
3580159 im not sure how much sympathy i have for a young arab officer pranging his lexus coupe while pissed and killing people
3580160 presumably that will save him having to apply for asylum here
3580161 if he is a muslim it will be really bad no drinking etc etc that kind of stuff will send you straight to hell
3580162 i have been on a battlefield with a batallion on ghurkas and a batallion of singapore defence force personnel when the lights went out
3580163 if he is a muslim it will be really bad no drinking etc etc that kind of stuff will send you straight to hell
3580164 to seek out and close with the enemy to kill or capture him etc
3580165 it feels funny because they lick your hand and it gets all slobbery
3580166 theyre a little bit early we just unloaded and they were born
3580167 the katanning sheep yards are in need of an upgrade there is talk down there that they possibly should be relocated as well
3580168 el poder ejecutivo lleva mano y el planteamiento y la visi n del gobernador es fundamental
3580169 ive kissed just three people in my life other than stuff that ive done for tv or movies

3580171 hay gente que todav a no ha podido regresar a su casa tenemos el conocimiento de que son alrededor de 20 familias algunas est n viviendo en guadalajara y no tienen la intenci n de regresar a la azucena
3580172 el d a de hoy ayer martes nos presentamos a ratificar una denuncia y no se la quisieron ratificar porque no llevaba el documento original cuando el documento original se encuentra en poder de la procuradur a
3580173 entonces caemos a lo mismo hay una poca disposici n de la procuradur a para iniciar las averiguaciones en este caso en particular pese a que se demostr con documentos que la constructora ten a pleno conocimiento de que el fraccionamiento ten a el riesgo de inundarse
3580174 no suena descabellado que haya incrementos porque los precios del petr leo as se han comportado pero el gobierno debe prever esos torbellinos inflacionarios y prepararnos con tiempo porque el sector maquilador presupuesta a largo plazo
3580175 durante el periodo del 31 de julio al 6 de agosto de 2008 los precios de los contratos a futuro de los crudos marcadores en los mercados internacionales registraron un comportamiento a la baja
3580176 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3580177 the fuel prices are hitting everybody hard tulsa public union jenks sand springs all of us are in the same boat
3580178 its hard to know i think yeah we probably will have more riders
3580179 we need to get through a couple days of school and look for hotspots and concerns
3580180 its too bad there arent more people its a nice atmosphere
3580181 we are pleased with our restaurants here and our brands positioning amidst the wide expanse of the games and its spectators
3580182 obviously it would have been nice to see more numbers earlier
3580183 but we are seeing a growing trend which will continue once the track and field competition begins in the 91 000 seat birds nest later this week
3580184 we are aware of this issue we are already planning to invite more people to the olympic green we definitely want more people and spectators
3580185 the forbidden city takes two hours to walk around and thats just a little bit compared to here
3580186 here in beijing there have been a few who have requested that more people be admitted into what are known as the olympic common areas and the organizing committee has been working to find appropriate means of doing this which we welcome
3580187 in light of limited seating capacity the places in the public viewing room will be allocated on a first come first served basis
3580188 it may have been that the previous government who set this process in train decided it was going to be easier to be overruled by the wto to demonstrate that its case couldnt stand rather than take the decision itself
3580189 but this is a case where on the surface it looks like we have tried to use the system to obstruct entry of new zealand apples
3580190 the panel should refrain from considering the substance of new zealand s claims in this dispute
3580191 forecasting a 10 drop in revenue over the next 12 months on top of a 17 revenue decline in the fiscal year that ends on june 30
3580192 in my nearly five decades in this business ive never experienced a downturn so deep and so broad
3580193 were at a time and place in this country where people are searching for something to share to come together around

3580195 no se limita solamente a la calzada independencia sino que se extiende hasta la isla de mezcala es un proyecto que va de la mano con imagen urbana de la generaci n de mejores espacios de circulaci n reforestaci n y ciclov as

3580197 somos conscientes de las necesidades del pa s somos de que es muy alto el presupuesto que estamos solicitando pero dicen que no hay puerta que no se abra siempre y cuando no se trate de abrir
3580198 tenemos ejemplos y no lo digo con envidia sino sencillamente como antecedente de la inversi n que se hizo en monterrey para el forum de las culturas por parte del gobierno federal y creemos que el evento que nosotros tenemos en guadalajara en torno a los panamericanos es un evento que debe ser considerado en un nivel similar o superior
3580199 por ello el gobierno de m xico saluda el plan de paz propuesto por la presidencia francesa de la uni n europea
3580200 lamenta profundamente la p rdida de vidas humanas y los numerosos heridos ocasionados por el enfrentamiento y subraya la importancia de que las partes adopten las medidas necesarias para respetar y hacer respetar el derecho internacional humanitario
3580201 al should participate in the local government polls on the basis of discussion with the government on relaxing the state of emergency

3580203 where was the state of emergency i did not find any state of emergency while visiting the pourashabha polls in fulbaria mymensignh
3580204 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
3580205 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm

3580223 concerned about cumulative lead exposures to children and whether lead from artificial turf particularly at older worn fields adds to those exposures
3580224 our initial take on the cpsc report is that it seems to support the fact that older fields do represent a potential cumulative exposure risk for lead
3580225 future reports about lead in artificial turf before we can make additional informed conclusions and recommendations
3580226 the potential downside on this if you dont take the precautions is lead poisoning for kids

3580275 while people starved ethiopia was growing linseed cake cottonseed cake and rapeseed meal for european livestock
3580276 millions of acres of land in the developing world are used for this purpose tragically 80 percent of the world s hungry children live in countries with food surpluses which are fed to animals for consumption by the affluent

3580296 why the p in the dpt vaccination may be hazardous to your childs health
3580297 the statistical evidence in favor of a connection between the deaths and the dpt shot was strong
3580298 the tombstone was placed on what happened in tennessee three years later in the september 1982 issue of the journal of pediatrics when bernier and his colleagues at the cdc wrote their epitaph on the infant deaths

3580300 they screen tons of kids they put them all through some very very good fundamental training and then the cream rises to the top
3580301 like any sport it takes money to create opportunities and more and more countries are streamlining funds to where the medals are i think thats sad
3580302 you still have to work within a budget but theres a been a subtle mind shift in the last two or three years where the athletics leadership says okay what do we need to do rather than what can we afford to do

3580305 in this situation being a student it gave me the flexibility to have time to train
3580306 theyre putting money into these programs at a very late stage
3580307 we for sure though can be looking at pre adolescent training on a much more intense level
3580308 a lot of times in canada you say well they are still young yet they have a long career but you have to instill all the skills all the flexibility all the movement patterns before they get through adolescence the clock is ticking and we have to understand that in canada

3580327 people told me it was something theyd show to their daughters i mean i was obsessed like everyone else with fashion magazines when i was a teenager its natural to look for the body ideal
3580328 here is a woman a great athlete 160 pounds who can bench press her own body weight and squat 180 pounds
3580329 smart women why wouldnt they also want to be seen as sexual
3580330 as humans we like the physically good looking the beautiful
3580331 but how much better if shes also the fastest woman in the world
3580332 gave me the opportunity to go out into the business world and prepared me for life i owe it all to being an athlete and having the opportunity to swim in college
3580333 were very very shy i mean the first time i went to a topless beach in spain i almost dropped dead then i saw a grandma over there and thought yeah i can do this
3580334 i knew i was attractive to the opposite sex but didnt see myself as sexy
3580335 i got a letter from a whole platoon in the u s navy saying how sexy i was i thought you gotta be freaking kidding
3580336 those people are treated the same way as any citizen involved in an event linked to a criminal investigation we are meeting everyone to establish the facts and the officers will be met in coming days
3580337 its nothing but racial profiling that led to the death of that young man
3580338 as soon as they see our kids whether theyre black or latino they see criminals the police are hostile to them they arrest them and sometimes they shoot them
3580339 the police see three individuals of non white culture and they automatically get interrogated and questioned
3580340 its not surprising that people at some point might rise up and say they cannot accept it any more

3580345 when we got our first computers we were on the internet all the time and so we were looking at pictures of our favorite video games and we noticed people dressed up like characters from the games
3580346 we got into researching that and found out that there are a lot of conventions for cosplay in texas
3580347 i just started working with wigs and its fun to do these crazy shapes that you cant actually do with normal hair
3580348 ive been practicing with that and getting better i get nervous cutting someone elses hair but if its a wig its ok it wont grow back but you can just buy another one
3580349 if we win this one well have won three in a row and well probably start getting asked to go to conventions
3580350 if that happens they pay for your ticket they pay for your airline youre called a guest and youll start judging skits
3580351 theres a japanese game that has disney characters in it its hopefully going to be something that people havent seen before thats what we like doing surprising people
3580352 we try to incorporate puppets and theater so theres a plot and a story
3580353 we ask what could we do for a story that would go along the lines of this anime
3580354 most of the friends we talk to now weve met over the past three years its a lot easier to get along with someone who likes doing this
3580355 a lot of our friends have kind of backed up a little bit not all of them some of them just think its kind of funny
3580356 i personally started doing it because i like making costumes some of these characters we make costumes of youre not going to find a pattern for that at wal mart
3580357 in the japanese anime video game culture there are a lot of stereotypes that all the people who are into it are really into sex and these weird things we dont watch that kind
3580358 you can minister anywhere doing anything we do not go to conventions and preach we just try to be a good example if people ask us to go party were just like no we go in our room and play apples to apples or yahtzee and were like you can come if you want and theyll see that we dont use any of those vices we just have fun
3580359 the attribute defined by this class attaches additional version information to an assembly
3580360 assemblies with the same name but different major versions are not interchangeable this would be appropriate for example for a major rewrite of a product where backward compatibility cannot be assumed
3580361 if the name and major number on two assemblies are the same but the minor number is different this indicates significant enhancement with the intention of backward compatibility this would be appropriate for example on a point release of a product or a fully backward compatible new version of a product
3580362 a difference in build number represents a recompilation of the same source this would be appropriate because of processor platform or compiler changes
3580363 assemblies with the same name major and minor version numbers but different revisions are intended to be fully interchangeable this would be appropriate to fix a security hole in a previously released assembly
3580364 net broadband additions in the quarter were the fewest of any quarter in the seven years leichtman research group has been tracking the industry

3580378 we cannot afford this 4 a gallon gasoline we cant afford high electricity rates for our small businesses and our families and we cannot afford the higher food prices that are caused by this higher transportation rate
3580379 all of it comes down to the price of energy and we can do something about it we have vast natural resources to solve this problem
3580380 its a time for us as leaders to take control of our energy future and our energy economic growth of the future theres no better place to begin that then right here at stp where were on the front lines of the nuclear renaissance
3580381 the cost of energy isnt picky its not saying its one situation here and another over here its difficult for all of us

3580395 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3580396 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3580397 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3580398 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3580400 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3580401 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3580402 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3580406 with labview 8 20 the combination of graphical programming and mathscript text based math provides a flexible and highly interactive approach to algorithm development
3580407 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3580408 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3580409 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3580410 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3580413 that bill subversive sharp watch out for him misses nothing a dots connector
3580414 i do not know this answer i was just answering the question
3580415 this is the first war that the united states has fought where so many of the people and resources involved arent of the military but from contractors
3580416 it was considered an all out imperative by the administration to keep troop levels low particularly in the beginning of the war and one way that was done was to shift money and manpower to contractors but that has exposed the military to greater risks from contractor waste and abuse
3580417 it is a shocking number but i still dont think it is the full cost
3580418 i dont think there have been any credible cost numbers for the iraq war there was so much money spent at the beginning of the war and nobody knows where it went
3580419 these new numbers point to the overall question when do you cross the line in terms of turning over too much of the public mission of defense to private firms
3580420 there are some things that are appropriate for private companies to do but other things that are not
3580421 but we dont seem to have had a strategy for determining which was appropriate and which wasnt we have just handed over functions to contractors in a very haphazard way

3580429 were thinking aloud on this one so feel free to explore the ramifications of this for yourself but if its true that obamas name is actually
3580430 see hes not barack obama after all so hand over your delegates now
3580431 techdude has informed me that he is unable to continue his work at this time due to family obligations and ongoing threats because we cannot show his completed work i have decided to remove his reports from this blog because they cannot be verified in their current unfinished form should he complete the work in the future i will re activate his posts
3580432 to settle this debate access to the original scanned file would be required otherwise people can make up what ever story they want about it and the conspiracy theory will live on
3580433 it seems that obama put a fake birth certificate on his official campaign website because he wanted to hide his indonesian identity from us including his muslim background and that pesky constitutional dual citizenship matter that is our assertion
3580434 interestingly our researchers have been unable to locate the public record showing that barry soetoro legally changed his name back to barack obama
3580435 its considered a local station because of the proximity to vancouver and because of that we are able to carry it on our cable systems in western washington
3580436 we know it was the right thing we knew it was going to be difficult but we certainly got much more out of it than we may have provided
3580437 i find it kind of ridiculous that people have to feel this way and to live in fear
3580438 the shop has been broken into twice stole laptop computers cell phones
3580439 we do need police protection and were going to get police protection but we dont need her
3580440 when she returned from jail and she was released of her duties thats when everybody wanted to complain about not having any police protection
3580441 we have all been harassed flipped off cussed out threats have been made
3580442 its sad because this is a nice place to live
3580443 a company will incorporate offshore where there are no taxes
3580444 that parent company charges the u s company lots of money for things like the trademark for the company logo the u s company says i made 50 million but my stupid parent company charged me 50 million for the logo the u s company gets to deduct the royalty fees as an expense and move profits to the parent company offshore in a tax free haven
3580445 even in a good year a lot of firms are failing
3580446 general motors lost 10 billion in 2005 so how much corporate profit tax would you expect them to pay american airlines lost almost a billion dollars what would you want them to pay them theyre already cutting people they pay when theyre profitable
3580447 dont we all fill out our tax returns as aggressively as we know how and take every deduction and credit were entitled to even if theyre unprincipled even if theyre in the tax code only because congress thinks we will appreciate them for subsidizing us
3580448 its common sense corporations dont earn profits in many years
3580449 all that said i think there probably is large tax avoidance by u s multinational corporations but in my view thats driven by the very high u s corporate tax rate a corporate tax rate cut is long overdue
3580450 we have a pretty high nominal corporate tax rate but effectively its not high at all
3580451 there are many tax avoidance strategies wed be far better off with a simpler structure that made sure taxes were actually paid by corporations
3580452 its amazing how many club officials read fire brand of the american league
3580453 we feel that the use of the word retard throughout the film 15 or more times is done without any regard for the dignity of people with intellectual disabilities
3580454 a demeaning and degrading parody of a person with intellectual disabilities
3580455 what can we do to counteract this use this really as an opportunity to tell people about the abilities of people with intellectual disabilities about the value and dignity that they want to live with
3580456 im sorry that they have this opinion i know that the people organizing it have not even seen the film i think in the context of the movie its really clear where were coming from but it was not meant to offend anybody
3580457 if i want to protest something because it offends me thats my right as an american and its also in the artists right to say and do whatever they want to do
3580458 we continue to evaluate our liquidity and our alternatives to improve the balance sheet
3580459 well continue to look at that to make sure that we have adequate liquidity to successfully implement this very significant kind of transformation
3580460 that is our intent but also i dont want to walk away from the fact that theres lots of variables hitting this business every day
3580461 our role is to make sure that were as flexible as we can be to kind of take those things coming at us both the good and the bad
3580462 what we really need to do is tell people that were back in the car business
3580463 we have a real opportunity on our hand over the next couple of years to show people that we have world class cars that were bringing here to the u s
3580464 no genocide has ever been so thoroughly documented while it was taking place
3580465 if eating meat offends my brother then i will never eat meat again
3580466 what do you have that wasnt given and if it was given why do you boast as if were not given
3580467 with some of the best young talent the sport has to offer and being held during the du quoin state fair the ama sports magic mile shootout will present some incredible racing to dirt track fans both old and new
3580468 i didnt think of the showdown one single time for about four months and then we improved a little bit and started keeping an eye on the points
3580469 but when we hit those two bumps in the road at topeka and chicago it was done over and completely out of mind there was just no way even over these last six races when weve been very competitive during qualifying i wouldnt have even considered the points had they not been shown to me after sonoma kind of out of the blue it was like hey were not totally out of this if we keep running well and thats just what we did in brainerd thats where it all got interesting and i actually didnt believe it
3580470 its a little complicated but you earn 85 points by getting in 16th and 175 by qualifying number one
3580471 mostly its five point increases for every spot you move up the ladder until the top four spots where its 10
3580472 so now its pretty simple we have to out qualify beckman and scelzi in reading that wont be easy but if we do it were probably in i can only say probably because there just happens to be another guy screaming up the points sheet from below and he could break all of our hearts
3580473 weve been focused on bob tasca and beckman for so long it was the same deal as the showdown
3580474 frankly 97 points in two races is a huge mountain to climb but it can be done and as long as its possible were going to try to make it happen
3580475 were just going to keep running as well as we can and let the chips fall if we run better than all those other guys in qualifying well make the showdown and have a shot at the hundred grand but we cant control how the other teams run i guess if we just go to reading and qualify number one they cant catch us after that well just keep working hard and try to win rounds in the end the points for both deals will just be what theyre going to be and well see where we sit
3580476 dari awal pks berkomitmen anti kkn apalagi setelah 10 tahun reformasi ternyata praktik kkn masih terus berlangsung hanya model dan trik kknnya saja yang memang sedikit berbeda oleh karena itu kontrak politik ini diperlukan di mana dalam perjalanannya nanti anggota legislatif dari pks harus mundur jika tidak dapat melaksanakan komitmen yang ada dalam kontrak politik ini

3580485 my understanding is that there will be no impact at all on residents by the operation of this rig
3580486 i have every confidence the whales will swim around it
3580487 it shouldnt be there but i think the important part of it is the principle is that people expect truth in advertising and particularly for political advertising
3580488 its untruthful to say that mark vaile is the member for lyne
3580489 so that you may become blameless and pure children of god without fault in a crooked and depraved generation in which you shine like stars in the universe
3580490 when russia moved in on georgia john mccain stood up immediately and told them to get out
3580491 you cant account for everyones stupid actions but when things do happen if you respond to it and take the appropriate action thats reassuring
3580492 thats just its wrong its a place where families come to eat and them taking a bath in the sink thats just not work ethic
3580493 burger king corp was just notified of this incident and is cooperating fully with the health department we have sanitized the sink and have disposed of all other kitchen tools and utensils that were used during the incident we have also taken appropriate corrective action on the employees that were involved in this video additionally the remaining staff at this restaurant is being retrained in health and sanitation procedures
3580494 thats just disgusting i wouldnt want to eat here after i heard something like that thats just not appropriate for employment
3580495 this kind of stunt really is a black eye for the restaurant itself

3580503 i think the economic situation is a lot stronger than what you hear in the media
3580504 we cater to a market that is sensitive to pricing if you put forth the right product theyre going to buy it
3580505 we are displacing customers daily that we are not able to supply we have to turn them away because we cant handle the current demand
3580506 what that tells me is that people are still traveling
3580507 the route 110 corridor is growing exponentially over the rest of long island
3580508 in our particular market the product were building has very strong corporate following with the companies that are present in that market

3580519 we have about 1 409 registered sex offenders in austin about 409 of those are incarcerated the rest are living in the community
3580520 for the registered sex offender it changes the amount of time that they have to register or notify use when they change address if from seven days to three
3580521 they have been attacking georgia from a cyber standpoint since july
3580522 our poor technician here has gotten three hours sleep in the past four days
3580523 the cyber attack was taking down every georgian government website
3580524 it is simply too early and we lack enough information to reach any conclusion as to the motive and identity of the attackers
3580525 these types of attack are only natural and happen immediately following any conflict or political tension
3580526 this actually looks more like grass roots hacktivist types people that jumped on the bandwagon
3580527 its like the olympics we are supposed to be above politics in the internet community
3580528 i first picked this up in bits and pieces last week off daily rotation
3580529 the japanese economy is certainly not falling into a hole
3580530 given that japan hasnt had excess capacity excess debt and excess employment this cyclical slowdown is not going to slip into a full blown structural adjustment like we saw with the recessions in the 1990s
3580531 its probably a line ball call whether japan meets the technical definition of a recession which is two quarters of negative growth
3580532 bigger better faster more are the driving themes behind the advanced network monitoring technology bbn technologies is building for the military
3580533 you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view until you climb into his skin and walk around in it
3580534 the sale of houses has become a natural occurrence in regions with the exception of farming areas and even realtors or
3580535 in the real estate market in chongjin or hamheung one story houses with two rooms and a kitchen are being sold for 2 000 3 000 dollars downtown
3580536 this does not mean that a change in the legal system has allowed the private ownership of real estate to be officially acknowledged people can just change the name on the permit to live in the state houses by giving bribes to government affiliates within the relevant departments
3580537 in fishing villages 12 and 14 year old middle school students are employed for 1 100 1 300 won per day to make nets this surpasses the 2 000 3 000 won salary for teachers and 10 000 15 000 won for the most coveted job as a laborer in state operated coal mines

3580542 if i can come up with another idea that they like well do another really with the last one steven wasnt that enthusiastic i was trying to persuade him but now steve is more amenable to doing another one yet we still have the issues about the direction wed like to take im in the future stevens in the past hes trying to drag it back to the way they were im trying to push it to a whole different place so still we have a sort of tension this recent one came out of that its kind of a hybrid of our own two ideas so well see where we are able to take the next one

3580571 as an american its my civic obligation to take part in our form of government and the only way i can do it is by voting
3580572 and i havent missed an election since i became eligible to vote whether it was a primary local runoff national sate it doesnt matter
3580573 the integrity of the judicial system as far as i can see is a joke and i think its a joke because people dont take the time to vote
3580574 i thought for me the important aspect of the primary was the choices for supreme court justices
3580575 i believe that a trend in our country has been for justices to legislate from the bench when they are simply there to interpret the laws that are already on the books
3580576 you have to state your party and that keeps people away a lot of people dont want to declare themselves
3580577 i realized that the primaries could be just as important as the general election
3580578 im really worried about the congressman porter race and i felt that if he had strong numbers in the primaries then he could get more people together for the general election against dina titus

3580592 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3580593 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3580594 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3580595 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3580596 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3580597 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3580598 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3580599 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3580600 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3580601 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3580602 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3580603 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3580604 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3580605 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3580606 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3580607 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3580608 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3580609 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3580610 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3580611 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3580612 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3580613 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3580614 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3580615 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3580616 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3580617 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

3580848 and things always tend to get a whole lot worse before they get any better
3580849 needless to say given the political nature a lot of people are pretty interested in what were going to be saying

3580867 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3580868 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3580869 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3580870 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3580871 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3580872 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3580873 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3580874 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3580875 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3580876 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3580900 they were always the hometown airline they were in the downtown parades they invested in the community
3580901 we have a number of businesses that depend on good air service
3580902 its going to be much harder for us to convince a high tech company that they should come here it hurts
3580903 we have a few airports out there that i think are spending more than they should quite frankly and so there are some real total airport cost increases that we are very vocal about
3580904 the more you raise fees the more you drive airlines and customers away
3580905 its rhetoric ive heard for 41 years but i understand
3580906 these folks arent sure if theyre going to be in business in six months
3580907 on the other hand airports are very dependent on the airlines bringing passengers

3580911 pursued by hungry driven paparazzi on all sides dianas mercedes benz sedan crashed shortly after midnight paris time in a tunnel along the seine river at the pont de lalma bridge
3580912 witnesses at the inquest into their deaths described how photographers were
3580913 this lovely couple was murdered with the paparazzi being used as a cover for the murder and sooner or later i will succeed in exposing the full facts and the people who committed such a horrendous crime
3580914 the key for the paparazzo is to get the information and get the shot before other paparazzi do
3580915 supermodel heidi klum took a similar approach to keep paparazzi away from her daughter
3580916 thats why i released the photos of her instead of having photographers hunt for them
3580917 in germany and france photographers need the permission of the people in their photograph
3580918 were still trying to ascertain for sure who did the shooting
3580919 we have suspects we have a lot of information to put together
3580920 the seattle police department considers this a matter of utmost seriousness
3580921 all five officers will be placed on administrative reassignment relieved of duty pending further investigation by the south dakota authorities
3580922 the whole place just flooded out a lot of people screaming a bunch of craziness i wasnt sure what it was
3580923 what ive been told is that our security guys identified him as the shooter

3580929 do you have a particular passage you would like to share
3580930 i dont remember what chapter its in but one of my favorite chapters is in the book of ezekiel it tells of how ezekiel was walking around the temple and there was water pouring out from underneath of it as he walked around the waters kept rising and rising until he was covered in them the chapter should be about 2 3 the way through the book
3580931 i think its around chapter 33 or 36 if you cant find it feel free to choose a different one
3580932 its definitely a topic of conversation that comes up a lot among my friends
3580933 its so easy for a tragic accident or severe illness to ramp up a 100 000 200 000 or 500 000 bill
3580934 for people who are young and in school and hardly ever need to go to the doctor thats fine
3580935 its a 35 billion contract and there are complex issues involved
3580936 we hope that it was just the beginning of a continuing dialogue as we move toward a final rfp that prescribes the right aircraft and gives appropriate weight to all of the capabilities that will be required for the evolving mission over the next several decades
3580937 they were productive positive and we look forward to a very near term release of the final rfp
3580938 because of trends in the health care industry we need people who have a new knowledge base for decision making

3580953 i basically told them that their pamphlet will be ordered by the courts to be thrown in the garbage if they are not careful in their choice of words
3580954 i specifically told them that they should not reference the part of imbra that deals with the introduction stage because this has the highest chance of being overturned in the courts
3580955 i also noted that their jobs could be declared unconstitutional as the us constitution does not authorize congress to deal with domestic violence issues of any kind please comment yourself because we must have sufficient numbers doing this

3580959 its the economy both in the u s and in japan

3581055 israel is following with great concern the developments in south ossetia and abkhazia and hopes the violence will end
3581056 israel recognizes the territorial integrity of georgia and calls for a peaceful solution
3581057 while israel was keen to downplay its role georgia perhaps hoped that flattery might draw israel further in
3581058 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
3581059 a small group of georgian soldiers were able to wipe out an entire russian military division thanks to the israeli training
3581060 georgian minister tells israel radio thanks to israeli training were fending off russian military
3581061 the fact that georgias defense minister davit kezerashvili is a former israeli who is fluent in hebrew contributed to this cooperation

3581072 i have been in this job 10 years now and i sense a mood for something to happen
3581073 if we had mentioned this three years ago i think the reaction would have been different now everyone club chairmen managers players officials fans media are all saying we saw things last season that overstepped the mark
3581074 its unfair to pick one person or one club out because weve all committed it

3581081 a nightmare is much more intense than a bad dream it can arouse feelings of fear horror and distress it replicates our deepest fears and can reflect the different types of stresses we face in our waking world
3581082 nightmarish thoughts such as losing your job being homeless falling and being chased are a manifestation of how much the credit crunch is affecting our daily lives and causing distressed sleep patterns
3581083 for example dreaming about being chased or falling is a reaction to the stresses we face in life the attacker or falling in the dream represents the emotion of fear and anxiety
3581084 its no wonder gordon brown and alistair darling are making a special appearance in our nightmares at the moment both symbolise the fears we are facing in todays economy
3581085 treasury secretary henry paulson delivered an upbeat assessment of the economy saying growth was healthy and the housing market was nearing a turnaround
3581086 at this juncture the impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime market seems likely to be contained
3581087 we will follow developments in the subprime market closely however fundamental factors including solid growth in incomes and relatively low mortgage rates should ultimately support the demand for housing and at this point the troubles in the subprime sector seem unlikely to seriously spill over to the broader economy or the financial system
3581088 it is not the responsibility of the federal reserve nor would it be appropriate to protect lenders and investors from the consequences of their financial decisions but developments in financial markets can have broad economic effects felt by many outside the markets and the federal reserve must take those effects into account when determining policy
3581089 weve got strong financial institutions our markets are the envy of the world theyre resilient theyre innovative theyre flexible i think we move very quickly to address situations in this country and as i said our financial institutions are strong
3581090 today i can say that we will not need additional funds these problems are behind us we will not return to the market
3581091 we deliberately raised more capital than we lost last year we believe that will allow us to not have to go back to the equity market in the foreseeable future
3581092 right now we believe that we are in a very comfortable spot in terms of our capital

3581112 as we can see now the diversion of our corn supply from grocery stores to gasoline pumps has caused the price of corn to spiral out of control corn prices were once driven by market forces today they are artificially driven up by a government mandate in 2004 before the mandates were imposed the cost of corn hovered around 2 per bushel now it is close to 8 per bushel this is driving up the cost of staple food items at the grocery store and it is also driving up the price of corn based feed devastating the livestock industry to the point that texas cattle feeders have been operating in the red since 2007

3581135 they have been attacking georgia from a cyber standpoint since july
3581136 our poor technician here has gotten three hours sleep in the past four days
3581137 the cyber attack was taking down every georgian government website
3581138 it is simply too early and we lack enough information to reach any conclusion as to the motive and identity of the attackers
3581139 these types of attack are only natural and happen immediately following any conflict or political tension
3581140 this actually looks more like grass roots hacktivist types people that jumped on the bandwagon

3581200 the tragic effect of these events upon your son who i have no doubt you love sincerely is one of the most disturbing features of this crime
3581201 tais irregularidades foram identificadas a partir de levantamentos e auditorias internas realizadas pela autarquia desde 2005
3581202 it is important that we understand all of our mistakes so that we can correct them and restore the faith of our residents in our programs
3581203 when you have enormous obstacles such as the ones we have faced most recently you have to start at the top and the buck stops with me
3581204 its uncommon to see people dressed up like this so the victims were watching them
3581205 then the perpetrator came up and said what are you staring at
3581206 every time i run into someone from there they want to talk about a home run that killebrew hit 30 years ago
3581207 it was harmon killebrew a whole bunch of pitchers gave up home runs to harmon killebrew whats the big deal
3581208 was there a point at which somebody slammed his face into the ground
3581209 the investigation is underway and no conclusions should be drawn until all of the facts are available and the totality of the circumstances can be considered
3581210 everyone in our country is initially entitled to a presumption of innocence even police officers
3581211 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3581212 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3581213 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3581214 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3581215 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3581216 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3581217 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3581218 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3581219 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3581220 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3581221 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3581222 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3581223 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3581224 the evidence shows that your excessive consumption of alcohol was a contributing factor in the incident
3581225 it was just so cruel and unthinking and so wrong because there is nothing you can do to prevent yourself being raped it is not illegal to go out and have a drink it is illegal to rape somebody
3581226 it was immoral my immediate reaction was there has got to be some way to fight this
3581227 it used to be that they were always blamed if they were wearing a short skirt today its that they were drinking
3581228 its very important for women whove been victims of rape to get compensation because often its the only acknowledgement you are going to get that you have been a victim of crime given that the conviction rate in this country is only 6
3581229 we have just completed a review of our staff instructions operating procedures and structure to ensure greater consistency in decision making
3581230 reduce the level of award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption
3581231 i have got an olympic medal i am absolutely delighted it has been a long long time coming and it means everything to me
3581232 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3581233 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3581234 if you meet your soulmate why let him get away
3581235 i think its a really romantic idea but its nothing to do with my parents getting together young
3581236 i dont want children too young though not until im much older
3581237 i remember thinking it strange to wear sunglasses inside the chapel
3581238 they held hands and looked eye to eye with him still wearing sunglasses during the ceremony
3581239 they looked very happy together i remember the bride looked very young and pale and quite angelic
3581240 they didnt bring any friends as witnesses so the photographer had to stand in
3581241 i asked them each if they agreed to love and cherish each other and they said i do it was over in 15 minutes the bride changed out of her wedding dress right away then they left the groom wasnt dressed up at all
3581242 i am aware of the statement that has been released and agree with its sentiments
3581243 the couple tied the knot in a simple low key ceremony in las vegas last week whilst holidaying in america
3581244 their marriage has the full support of their family and friends peaches and max did not want unnecessary publicity but following growing media speculation have decided to set out the facts
3581245 she had a huge row with ex boyfriend faris four days before she went away
3581246 she said she wanted to get rid of a matching tattoo she had done with him
3581247 the next thing we know she is with max whose band is getting quite big in america
3581248 she then turned up wearing a wedding ring saying they had got married
3581249 we have met peaches and we are very happy to have her as part of the family
3581250 when he did he looked pretty tired they must have stayed up late the night before
3581251 he didnt look very smart he had a light blue shirt and jeans on

3581256 increasingly there are no limits technologically as to what a company can do in terms of collecting information and then selling it as a commodity to other providers

3581258 insight into the number of people who have seen an ad campaign
3581259 how many users visited their sites after seeing an ad
3581260 google is slowly embracing a full blown behavioral targeting over its vast network of services and sites
3581261 while the social networking trend first took off in north america it is beginning to reach a point of maturity in the region
3581262 however the phenomenon is still growing rapidly in other regions around the world especially as the established american brands turn their focus to developing markets
3581263 facebook has done an exceptional job of leveraging its brand internationally during the past year
3581264 by increasing the sites relevance to local markets through local language interface translation the site is now competing strongly or even capturing the lead in several markets where it had a relatively minor presence just a year ago
3581265 exxon mobil has spent over 13m in the save the tiger fund since 1992
3581266 janet isnt part of exxons public relations machinery the company said it has no idea who she is and wasnt aware of her until the chronicle called to ask
3581267 as to be blatantly fake i find it amusing that the twitter community and social media experts fell for the exxon mobil twitter account hook line and sinker an entire post to exxon mobils social media efforts on twitter pointing out such things as
3581268 youll also notice when you visit the exxon twitter account that janet is directly and actively engaging with others she replies back at folks responding to their queries all a good practice
3581269 while i dont know which group is responsible for this effort at exxon likely corp comm backed by pr firm itll be interesting to see how they handle the many criticisms in their industry as soon as janet releases her full name ill be sure to add her to the growing list of community managers at enterprise corporations
3581270 is exxon ready to make these important changes beyond discussing it in public
3581271 is this community team backed from the top and ready for the long haul
3581272 will this effort impact the bottom line or change public perception
3581273 and the exxonmobilcorp account are not legitimate owyang proceeded to argue that
3581274 on a theoretical level but on a practical level the fake twitter account really isnt going to harm the company
3581275 it was too easy for someone to assume a brands identity and we all fell for it myself obviously we need to first determine if these are the real employees and validate im exploring some ways to do this well revisit this topic soon
3581276 the exxonmobilcorp account though should have raised some red flags immediately the graphic image on the account shows service stations an odd choice since exxonmobil has announced its intention to sell its service stations and get out of that business altogether
3581277 hand for those who were actually paying attention and actually thinking
3581278 its not simply that the possibility that information overload promoted by an internet that makes everything instantly available will lead to a society filled with individuals incapable of focusing concentrating and thinking deeply but that it will lead to a society that lacks all perspective and that is infinitely corruptible because the masses lack an ability to separate the wheat from the chaff
3581279 exxon mobil fell victim to on twitter has a greater impact on consumers than it does on corporations
3581280 the term beta refers to a web page that is still under development we would like your feedback about the food beta homepage to try to improve it further then once everyone is happy with it well remove its beta label
3581281 feels just like a bit of a con to make you forgive any shortfalls or broken links
3581282 it does make me wonder whether in this instance at least beta isnt simply being used as a protective measure

3581443 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time
3581444 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3581445 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3581446 russia has much more to lose than the soviet union had to lose in 1968
3581447 russia has one foot in integration into the international economy and community of states and one foot that is not quite in
3581448 russia is going to have to assure its integration into the wto and the oecd and the g8 and institutions like that
3581449 to undermine our relations to curtail our relations we might as well let the united states deal on its own with some of the issues
3581450 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3581451 there is a text it has been accepted in moscow it was accepted here in georgia i have the agreement of all the protagonists
3581452 our visit is a sign of the solidarity of our five countries with the georgian nation which has been a victim of aggression
3581453 these nations still remember how in 1939 the soviet army crossed into their territory to purportedly defend the rights of ethnic minorities
3581454 in the baltic states and ukraine independence is still seen as something fragile and not necessarily built to last so if its not defended actively it cant last
3581455 people are certainly afraid that russia could attack lithuania just like georgia and you see that kind of view among politicians
3581456 were georgias closest friend in the region weve suffered the same kind of violence
3581457 if military aggression is being justified by the need to protect russian citizens then this should cause concern for all countries with russian nationals living within their borders
3581458 we cant allow a second munich when the international community climbed down to hitler that led to world war ii to a huge tragedy and millions of victims

3581464 to actually come and give back to people that are risking their lives for us so we can play the game that everybody sees us play this is not a game this is actual life
3581465 we kind of take that for granted at times with complaining about practice not wanting to go lift weights at a certain time we kind of take that for granted because thats just the simple game of football something we love to do
3581466 it hits home very hard for me you hear a lot of stories about what goes on but you dont visually see it i had the first chance to visually see the injuries they had i saw guys with legs taken off and arms not there it was just an amazing site to see you really dont get to see that on a regular basis but at the same time the people were great i had a great time i learned so much from this experience and the camaraderie these soldiers have for one another
3581467 coming out here and seeing all of this its really touching to me
3581468 that could have easily been my father or a friend of mine or my uncle it could be any of them its hard to see but its good to be out here and im glad we came out here to show our support
3581469 its incredible to see guys that are so optimistic and full of life that was something good for us to be around even through their injuries theyre very happy
3581470 we got the chance to run around with guys with one arm and one leg guys in wheelchairs and theyre still having fun
3581471 our injuries dont even seem that big anymore me and brian were talking about our injuries and realized these guys have such big hearts we saw a guy in a wheelchair who got hit by a bomb and lost one of his legs and he was the most optimistic person around that inspires us what we do is a game we like to think about us going out to battle but when you come out here and see the actual guys its like my world really isnt what it seems its really a game these guys are the real deal
3581472 i was talking with one of the medics here and thats why this dodgeball game is so unique because its better than just going out and walking on a treadmill or doing whatever they do that you would think would be normal physical therapy
3581473 this is physical therapy for them for them to be able to play dodgeball or interact with a football player from ut its a morale booster because its not something they get to do every day then they can watch these guys on tv once the season starts and say hey i remember playing dodgeball with him its a continuous morale booster for these guys and it helps them get better faster in their attitude and their motivation
3581474 these wounded soldiers are down here in a controlled environment they have no outreach to a lot of folks
3581475 theyre bound to this facility so it means the world for outside heroes of theirs the football players to come down here the soldiers did their part on the battlefield and we dont want to forget about them we appreciate the players coming down and taking the time to acknowledge their presence and acknowledge their sacrifices
3581476 my dad and i are big ut fans weve got a lot of autographs and everything i just love ut its just me its always nice to have somebody come and just show their respect especially somebody as big as ut players theyve always been such idols to me its always nice to have that
3581477 for them to actually be excited to see us its amazing
3581478 i was excited to see them because theyre doing something for me and i dont even know them
3581479 without these guys there is no game of football theres no ncaa football theres no nfl theres no mlb or college baseball there are no sports unless these guys protect our country theyre the biggest thing weve got going for us right now in order for us to play this game we need them we need to make them feel appreciated because were not the ones out there fighting for our freedom they are we need to show them as much love as we can
3581480 she does a lot of trekking herself but she was very excited about it
3581481 we did say it was going to be a life changing experience and it certainly has been that
3581482 volatility in global markets and a slowing in economic activity placed upward pressure on funding costs and caused an increase in loan impairment expenses

3581484 we are cautious going into the new financial year and the group will continue with its conservative stance until signs of improvements in economic conditions are evident
3581485 the groups capital position is strong with capital levels well above target ranges
3581486 the bank advises that it has made this decision after its board assessed the current economic climate the uncertainty in world financial markets and the risks involved in integrating these complex businesses at this time
3581487 i dont know how i can ever say that i am sorry
3581488 i will be sorry for the rest of my life

3581493 i think in many respects saakashvili got too close to the united states and the united states got too close to saakashvili it made him overreach it made him feel at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble

3581528 we cater to a market that is sensitive to pricing if you put forth the right product theyre going to buy it
3581529 we are displacing customers daily that we are not able to supply we have to turn them away because we cant handle the current demand

3581541 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3581542 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3581543 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3581544 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

3581547 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3581548 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3581549 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3581550 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3581551 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3581552 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3581553 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3581554 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3581555 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3581556 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3581557 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3581558 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3581559 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3581560 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3581561 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3581562 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3581563 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3581564 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3581565 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3581566 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3581567 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3581568 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3581569 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3581570 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3581571 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3581572 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3581573 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3581574 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3581575 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3581576 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3581577 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3581578 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3581579 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3581580 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3581581 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3581582 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3581583 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3581584 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3581585 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3581586 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3581587 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3581588 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3581589 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3581590 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3581591 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3581592 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3581593 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3581594 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3581595 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3581596 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3581597 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3581598 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3581599 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3581600 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3581601 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3581602 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3581603 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3581604 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3581605 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3581606 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3581607 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3581608 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3581609 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3581610 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3581611 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3581612 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3581613 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3581614 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3581615 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3581616 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3581617 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3581618 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3581619 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3581620 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3581621 who are open to doing something on the production side
3581622 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3581623 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3581624 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3581625 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3581626 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3581627 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3581628 i hope that this investigation makes steady progress and leads to the quick return of the victims to japan

3581633 i am not aware of any internal protocols that govern the timing of the process
3581634 but certainly the governor wanted to look at all the potential candidates before nominating an individual
3581635 the governor shall fill any vacancy within 21 days of the public submission by the commission

3581645 the relevant maps went blank as soon as fighting broke out
3581646 google has not made any recent change to georgia armenia and azerbaijan in google maps
3581647 we do not have local data for those countries and that is why local details such as landmarks and cities do not appear
3581648 i went in front to trim some low bushes and then i saw the bear and he was close almost face to face
3581649 i could see his eyes i have seen bears before but i have never seen any bear be aggressive like that
3581650 it was so quick there was no signal that the black bear would attack
3581651 he was so quick and was very strong much more than i thought i could hear he was chomping on my head he pulled me upside down and broke my ribs he bit me i kept telling myself that i had to be strong if she wanted to survive
3581652 it was a most horrible thing he was not going away so i used all my energy to yell i had lost so much blood i thought in one more minute i dont know if he is going to go for my heart then i thought i am not ready to die i have to fight
3581653 if he had not tried to hit the bear i am not sure if it would have given up i would like to find this person and thank them
3581654 he would not give up even when people were throwing stones at him
3581655 this has changed my life of course i am seeing a psychiatrist right now because i cannot sleep it is still fresh i cannot get it out of my mind right now
3581656 before i was comfortable being in the garden alone now i dont know
3581657 it was a terrible shock thank goodness she was in the front yard and not the back yard
3581658 its devastating it was pretty close for her the main thing is she is alive
3581659 it was granted to me to carry away from my prison years on my bent back which nearly broke beneath its load this essential experience how a human being becomes evil and how good
3581660 i think the economic situation is a lot stronger than what you hear in the media
3581661 we cater to a market that is sensitive to pricing if you put forth the right product theyre going to buy it
3581662 we are displacing customers daily that we are not able to supply we have to turn them away because we cant handle the current demand
3581663 what that tells me is that people are still traveling
3581664 the route 110 corridor is growing exponentially over the rest of long island
3581665 in our particular market the product were building has very strong corporate following with the companies that are present in that market
3581666 ive come to believe that each of us has a personal calling thats as unique as a fingerprint and that the best way to succeed is to discover what you love and then find a way to offer it to others in the form of service working hard and also allowing the energy of the universe to lead you

3581674 this may need to be a two step process reduce to 11 now and then to nine
3581675 i object to the arbitrary use of councils name in the form of a press release to engage in personal attack
3581676 for cr wes hartley to use the council logo and one assumes council funds to make personal political public statements is simply not acceptable
3581677 i no longer have the confidence in wes hartley to provide impartial and true leadership of the council
3581678 knowing how the council votes i dare say the general consensus would go along with his actions regardless of whether they were asked or not
3581679 troy gets on his little bandwagons that might lift his poor profile in the community
3581680 after reading it i feel it is a positive step towards clarifying matters and seeking to combine the efforts of the council and the member for vasse
3581681 clearly in this instance were under harsh and unfair criticism
3581682 health minister jim mcginty has failed to present one sound argument to support the decision to relocate the hospital to vasse
3581683 the governments own consultant reports that evaluated alternate sites for the hospital concluded that from both a technical and financial point of view the current site was superior to the proposed vasse site
3581684 this decision is in part recognition of the hard work of local residents who have fought to keep the hospital on its current site organising a massive petition numerous public meetings and attending a major rally during a debate on the busselton hospital in parliament
3581685 this decision confirms that the will of the people and the facts provided by all the governments advisers have been listened to and common sense will prevail if a liberal government is elected
3581686 on behalf of the bhcc and the 70 per cent of the people who voted for the mill road site at the referendum i hope that the result of the election will enable this decision to become a reality
3581687 we are confident this figure will enable us to provide new sporting facilities that busselton residents can be proud of
3581688 we are operating to a budget and in the interests of good management we do not intend to exceed the allocated budget of 16 75 million
3581689 the public will be consulted on this issue before a final decision is made on the plan by the council we are looking at a higher density than initially envisioned to align with the densities of the surrounding area r30 which is in the interests of orderly and proper planning
3581690 on may 19 the shire of busselton together with the licensing enforcement division organised a meeting to discuss the interpretation of the liquor control act with accommodation providers
3581691 the meeting was an opportunity for the accommodation providers to become aware of their obligations and responsibilities and also to provide a forum for them to air their concerns about leavers 2008
3581692 police understand that although this information has been supplied verbally to the accommodation providers they are waiting on written confirmation
3581693 they intend to supply this letter as soon as possible currently they are still in negotiations with the department of racing gaming and liquor to officially firm up the status of the legislation and once this has been completed the letters will be distributed
3581694 i have not seen a crowd like this i am overwhelmed austin
3581695 to ignore the problems in the world in order to be hopeful
3581696 to believe that the world as it is is not the world as it has to be
3581697 hope hope in the face of difficulty hope in the face of uncertainty the audacity of hope
3581698 in front of the old state capitol in springfield illinois a place where abraham lincoln has served and where he delivered his famous speech in which he said that a nation divided against itself could not stand
3581699 w e can close the gap between those two worlds if we apply hard work and imagination and diligence and if we work together
3581700 i was inspired by that sermon not only because i thought that it applied to my life because it told me
3581701 that you dont have to ignore the problems in the world to be hopeful you simply have to be committed to bringing about change and doing everything you can to imagine a better world
3581702 persuade a man only insofar as you can talk his language by speech gesture tonality order image attitude idea identifying your ways with his
3581703 but i was also inspired because i realized that the idea described the very essence of america that america at every stage always had the audacity to hope
3581704 that he took with united states senior senator dick durbin while on the congressional campaign trail and one of the places we went to was a place called cairo illinois located in the most southerly and westerly county in the state and for those of you who dont know cairo illinois back in the late sixties and early seventies was the site of some of the worst racial violence of anyplace in the nation as bad as anything going on in mississippi and alabama i mean there were cross burnings and active white citizen counsels and black people couldnt get jobs in this town and ultimately there was civil unrest and the national guard was called in and as we are going down to cairo he starts telling me the first time he went down there was during this period and that he was a young lawyer that he had been called in by the lieutenant governor to see what could be done to improve the racial climate there so he goes down takes the train gets picked up at the depot it is driven by a volunteer to where he is going to be staying and before he gets out of the car the volunteer says to him listen young man whatever you do dont use the telephone in your motel room

3581714 and feel we lack the resources necessary to deal with this kind of problem
3581715 that understanding human irrationality can improve how public and private institutions shape policy by increasing the likelihood that people will make decisions that are in their own self interest while protecting freedom of choice
3581716 incompetent or corrupt government nudgers can do a great deal of harm by directing people towards bad choices
3581717 they emphasize that in many areas from personal finance to health people are ill informed inexperienced and therefore ill equipped to make the choices that are in their own self interest

3581737 manly and german to depend wholly on oneself in this struggle
3581738 it is just as manly and german for a people to follow such a fuhrer unconditionally and loyally without excuse or reservation
3581739 to trust in the good star that is above him and us all
3581740 i cant explain why they underestimate him but they do
3581741 i think they underestimate him because he is from midland texas
3581742 and his idea of a vacation spot is crawford texas rather than hyannisport
3581743 he is one of the best read people i have ever met he was a yale undergraduate a history major he has a great sense of history and its forces he is the first president to be an mba a harvard mba
3581744 i think a great deal of it is his personal characteristics

3581759 mr bush is still peddling the fantasy that the free market with a little help from tax cuts solves all problems
3581760 the use of a sacrificial receptacle for the ritual unburdening of ones sins
3581761 is right wing think tank jargon in the past mr bushs speechwriters might have found less offensive language now theyre not even trying to hide his fundamental indifference to the plight of less fortunate americans
3581762 i think the united states must be humble and must be proud and confident of our values but humble in how we treat nations that are figuring out how to chart their own course
3581763 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us and our nation stands alone right now in the world in terms of power and thats why weve got to be humble and yet project strength in a way that promotes freedom
3581764 there is a protectionist and isolationist sentiment in our country and im going to resist that sentiment madly because i believe that we can and must lead the world to peace

3581777 i wrote to one of mr bushs aides the other day
3581778 a smart and gifted man and he sent back a note saying the most moving thing that has happened to him the past two months is seeing that george bush is a great man a truly great man
3581779 one of the best most unusual the most down home the most moving and the most fun the country has to offer
3581780 we understand that we are young we understand that we dont have the experience thats all we hear
3581781 thats understandable and its true because we havent done anything in this league yet
3581782 you feel bad for bobby but its the nature of the business other guys get the opportunity to at least show what they can do show their potential
3581783 thats the way we looked at it thats the way bobby looked at it
3581784 theres no pressure added just go out and play football
3581785 we all realize that its now a great opportunity for a lot of receivers and with the situation were in now it kind of magnifies a little bit more
3581786 but our approach is to stay calm try and stay relaxed and not to think about added pressure
3581787 i honestly thought i was going to play defensive back thats what the coaches told me and what a lot of the guys wanted me to do but when i got there they were having a lot of receiver problems
3581788 thats all i remember is them saying were going to give you a shot at wide receiver and i was like ok i was just happy to be there
3581789 hes got great skill hes fast i mean his athletic ability is special
3581790 its a tough situation that happened to bobby thats our mentor hes our ambassador
3581791 hes a guy who we really look up to but weve still got to go play
3581792 i pulled a muscle in the first game and it was getting worse and worse and worse
3581793 it was maybe a little more frustrating this time having played him last week and winning fairly easily
3581794 it seemed everyone in washington knew it was going to happen except me
3581795 its almost impossible to play against him thats why im stopping guys like him
3581796 its very hard to wear them down were strong mentally but physically they take no prisoners

3581824 then let him be treated like hippolytus and dragged by wild horses
3581825 how is it that you being a jew ask me for a drink since i am a samaritan woman
3581826 if you knew the gift of god and who it is who says to you give me a drink you would have asked him and he would have given you living water
3581827 sir you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep where then do you get that living water
3581828 you are not greater than our father jacob are you who gave us the well and drank of it himself and his sons and his cattle
3581829 everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again 14 but whoever drinks of the water that i will give him shall never thirst but the water that i will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life
3581830 sir give me this water so i will not be thirsty nor come all the way here to draw
3581831 blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled
3581832 seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you
3581833 he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water

3581839 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life
3581840 okay look you dont have to understand it all just do this
3581841 therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus
3581842 our law doesnt judge a man before it hears from him and knows what hes doing does it
3581843 technology doesnt become socially interesting until it becomes technologically boring
3581844 social ramifications of new communication channels or how not to hook up at the airport
3581845 there is now no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus
3581846 therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus
3581847 when you find a therefore you find out what its there for
3581848 for we know that the law is spiritual but i am of the flesh sold into bondage to sin
3581849 i find then the principle that evil is present in me the one who wants to do good
3581850 i want to do good so badly but this evil within me just wont let me im a prisoner to my own sin
3581851 thanks be to god through jesus christ our lord so then on the one hand i myself with my mind am serving the law of god but on the other with my flesh the law of sin
3581852 therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are christ jesus
3581853 we cant win this struggle against the flesh we cant escape the slavery to sin therefore we shouldnt worry about it
3581854 for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death
3581855 for what the law could not do weak as it was through the flesh god did sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an offering for sin he condemned sin in the flesh 4 so that the requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit
3581856 sin in the flesh so that the requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us
3581857 do not think that i came to abolish the law or the prophets i did not come to abolish but to fulfill
3581858 i go to church occasionally i volunteer here and there i dont drink or use drugs and ive never hurt anybody so i think im a pretty good person
3581859 therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus
3581860 thank you or how twitter helped me change my life

3581867 slots are not faa property and cannot be auctioned by faa
3581868 dot said it plans to use the funds generated from the auction
3581869 the group lobbied on issues including airline passenger rights air transportation financing reform and federal aviation administration reauthorization according to the form posted online july 21 by the house clerks office
3581870 natca spent nearly 1 3 million in lobbying activities in all of 2007 according to the associated press
3581871 among those registered to lobby on behalf of the ata were clint fisher formerly of the transportation department among other federal positions sharon pinkerton who used to work for rep
3581872 it could be a shot in the arm for those who theorize the faa and the ata are in collusion over the issue of user fees
3581873 some stupid psychologists have since stated to the media that lgbti people were more evil and immoral than heterosexual people
3581874 so it has became a national issue and the police department and some radical islamic groups have been sweeping some gay areas in jakarta the police have already detained some gay persons in central jakarta
3581875 that homosexuals commit sadistic killings should not surprise anybody if you know their world people with deviant sexual behavior are used to be close to criminal world they are used to make threats and to use force if someone who is invited to intimacy refuses the offer with such habits they can commit more serious crimes of course
3581876 homosexuals have stronger feelings of jealousy and they can act quite violently when their wishes are not granted gays homosexuals have a deviant sexual behavior and their aggressiveness is therefore beyond normal
3581877 there are a lot of heterosexual persons who also become murderers
3581878 its not true the gay and lesbian persons are more possesive than heterosexual persons anyone could become a murderer it has nothing to do with sexual orientation
3581879 my friend was arrested in senen area jakarta during a police razzia raid the reason was not clear i am now afraid to be kicked out from my apartment since the ryan affair started all gays have become afraid
3581880 not discount that it will conduct raids against hangout places of homosexuals
3581881 homosexuality is like an infectious disease that is why the local government should be tough with the usual gay hangout places if they are left free they will ultimately infect the larger population
3581882 gays and lesbians will 100 sure go to hell because same sex relationships are forbidden by the koran
3581883 we in arus pelangi are now preparing for possible attacks from fundamentalist islamic groups including evacuation
3581884 we are preparing an urgent appeal for solidarity from international friends urging them to write letters of concern to the indonesian embassies and consulates in their countries
3581885 since indonesia ratified the international covenant on civil and politic rights in 2005 many human rights violations continue to take place including arrests of gays simply because of their sexual orientation it is not right and the state has no right to arrest lgbti people for their sexual orientation it also has no right to legalise violence done by some fundamentalist islamic groups against lgbti people
3581886 we want to help expand the recycling habit from the house and workplace
3581887 the university is not doing enough to recycle in west downs student village bins are only placed by the car park at the very front of west downs
3581888 ensure recycling services are available a major public sector sites
3581889 people who already recycle will be encouraged and reassured that their efforts are worthwhile and those who do not currently recycle will be able to see it as easy and not just something other people do
3581890 part of the publishers series of international handbooks on information systems this is a great fat book which does indeed concentrate on the technical side rather than on pedagogy its concern is the design and implementation of hardware software systems including networks for educational and training contexts its more than forty chapters each describe relevant research and practice and close with invaluable reference lists the book itself has a fairly lengthy and detailed index also invaluable
3581891 she usually doesnt lose it like that but her life has spiraled out of control and once she opened the floodgates it was all over she just crumpled putting her head in her hands and sobbing
3581892 there has been an enormous media thing with this in the united states
3581893 from isabels perspective it was just a normal car accident
3581894 isabel would not get into the car with someone she thought was drink driving
3581895 we have seen a dramatic increase in recent years but we have also seen it climbing more in recent months
3581896 its been increasing steadily without the programme some families and kids would be going without
3581897 they should be refilling it in the next three or four days
3581898 it can be done i get 7 back on 10
3581899 in this location its still mostly old people and people who have retired from city jobs on stamps
3581900 last st patricks day we were selling irish soda bread for 1 99 this year it was 2 99 prices are just spiralling up because of the cost of gas trucking the food into the city and because of commodity prices people complain but i tell them its not my fault everything is more expensive
3581901 the amount of food stamps per household hasnt gone up with the food costs
3581902 our clients are finding they arent able to purchase food like they used to
3581903 i think its a positive thing because shes a really great actress but yeah sometimes it can be a little annoying
3581904 its crazy that were both in films at the same time but i havent even seen it yet i just havent had time

3581912 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3581913 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3581914 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3581915 the russians have clearly overreacted but president saakashvili for some reason seems to think he has a hall pass from this administration
3581916 we knew they were going to go crack heads we told them again and again not to do this
3581917 we thought we had an understanding with the russians that any response would be south ossetia focused clearly its not
3581918 i would say that we mostly were focused elsewhere unlike during the cold war when wed see a single soviet armor battalion move so yes the size and scope of the russian move has come as something of a surprise
3581919 while their utility in country may be very limited removing them might inadvertently signal to the world that we are abandoning our ally which we most certainly are not

3581977 as a result this division is behind last year and we are currently re organising the business to counter the changing business conditions
3581978 the main reason for this is reduced volume due mainly to significant summer frosts especially in the hawkes bay region

3581990 we hope that 90 percent of the lawmakers will support us
3581991 we have backed him and voted for him so we are duty bound to support him we will oppose impeachment
3581992 there is a strong likelihood but not certainty that the ruling coalition can impeach him
3581993 the army would be crazy for doing that the army needs to improve its reputation and image with the people of pakistan
3581994 the sass patronised by rss and bajrang dal is trying to give shape to the long cherished concealed agenda of the sangh parivar to divide the state on regional and religious lines
3581995 let me make it clear to sass leaders they should not try to browbeat the kashmiri politicians as such idiotic actions could cause more harm to the people of jammu than any other region
3581996 credible inputs that thousands of sangh parivar activists from gujarat up mp and maharashtra have infiltrated into jammu and it is they who are planning and spearheading the protests there
3581997 those opposed to the amarnath land transfer were questioning jammu and kashmirs status as an integral part of the country
3581998 jammu and kashmir is an integral part of india whoever raises questions on this issue will have to pay for it
3581999 this is not a question of amarnath or a shrine alone they are saying it is okay that you have alloted land for vaishno devi in jammu but how can you allot land in kashmir
3582000 shyama prasad mookerjee during his struggle 55 years ago for cancelling the visa system for those visiting the state had promised people that he would either get the permit system abolished or sacrifice his life we seem to have turned a full circle today
3582001 excessive use of force by indian security forces against the kashmiri people and called for an immediate end to violence in jammu and kashmir
3582002 it took diane pickel plappert six months to tell a counselor that she had been raped while on duty in iraq while time passed the former navy nurse disconnected from her children and her life slowly unraveled carolyn schapper says she was harassed in iraq by a fellow army national guard soldier to the extent that she began changing clothes in the shower for fear hed barge into her room unannounced as he already had on several occasions
3582003 if our convoy is halted there will be trouble kashmiri public opinion is in favour of crossing this bloody line
3582004 however a decision in the matter can be taken only through mutual arrangements between india and pakistan
3582005 this is not protest against land transfer in fact this is anger against india
3582006 i see this will have a bad impact and considering that pakistan is going through a bad turmoil now the overall impact on the peace process will not be very positive
3582007 such statements by leaders of a foreign country do not help the situation nor do they contribute to creating the atmosphere necessary for the dialogue process between india and pakistan to move forward

3582014 the issue here is matrimonial matters involving a muslim and a non muslim there is a lot of unhappiness among non muslims on how such matters are handled at present
3582015 there is no proper legal representation for issues involving property and child custody
3582016 i dont think the way forward is to have a closed door meeting to come up with a solution and impose it on the people it does not work you need to understand the problem faced by the people and try to help them with it nst online

3582020 arrow 3 system an advanced model of an arrow interception missile would help israel intercept ballistic missiles in a much wider range than the current model
3582021 israel objected to the development of the sm 3 at the expense of the us funding of the new arrow program as the defense ministry prefers to provide work to israeli industries and because the cost of the new standard is estimated at 10 12 million per missile while the arrow 3 will only cost 1 5 2 million per unit
3582022 the program will be under american supervision and should it turn out that the development is being delayed or is failing to reach its objectives the resources will be shifted to the development of the sm 3

3582031 there is much to justify turkeys reverence for atat rk he is the force that allowed turkey to rise form the ashes of defeat and emerge as a vibrant new nation without atat rks vision without his ambition and energy without his astonishing boldness in sweeping away traditions accumulated over centuries todays turkey would not exist and the world would be much poorer
3582032 nationalism in my opinion is nothing more than an idealistic rationalization for militarism and aggression nationalism is an infantile disease it is the measles of mankind
3582033 trying to understand turkey without understanding atat rk would be like studying european history without considering christianity
3582034 announced the revival of a pure islam untainted by politics
3582035 through constitutional juridical and political reforms through reform of the educational system and through his attacks on the prevailing ideology he sought to accomplish changes in the superstructure making inroads from all directions indeed he was so determined that people would accept the changed social institutions that he was prepared to use force if necessary
3582036 unlike america where secularism is separation of church and state in turkey and many other lands secularism means the subjugation of church to state
3582037 by attacking the headscarf atat rk had made clear that he considered nothing sacred simply because it was long established
3582038 in atat rks system pluralism personal freedom and individuality do not fit
3582039 atat rk indeed had many other talents than simple power of imagination not only had he the determination but a tremendous gift of timing and measuring what could be accomplished
3582040 atat rk was going to realize many of the dreams of the progressive ottomans evidently atat rk had the genius of realizing them in contrast to others who had only made statements in the best intellectual tradition
3582041 rewarded ankara for supporting the nationalists by declaring it the countrys capital
3582042 a brim kept a pious muslim from touching his forehead to the ground part of the muslim prayer
3582043 the chief mufti of egypt who since the abolition of the caliphate had become a leading voice of islam proclaimed that any muslim who wore a hat was an infidel and a sinner
3582044 from 1923 on atat rks repression of kurdish nationalism and even kurdish identity was savage and predatory
3582045 a major battlefield victory at lausanne to his credit a magnificent one at that
3582046 reforms could not have been based merely on his undeniably enormous prestige as national liberator
3582047 the ruling democratic party demokrat parti dp became increasingly authoritarian and used the majoritarian framework of the 1924 constitution to oppress the opposition republican peoples party cumhuriyet halk partisi chp
3582048 in the name of guardianship of the kemalist nation state
3582049 established as an advisory body to the government on both internal and external security and designed to enable the military to convey their views to ministers formally
3582050 the military argued that they were fulfilling their legal obligation and their action had popular support
3582051 against the background of earlier interventions it is hardly surprising that the eus first communications on the turkish bid for union membership voiced concern about the major role played by the army in political life
3582052 neither the taf nor the turkish electorate regarded any of the military intervention as fundamentally anti democratic behavior but rather as extraordinary action fully necessary to safeguard democracy in the country
3582053 the atat rk faith of kemalism has its clergy military and political elite faithful beyond measure and ceaselessly on the watch for apostates
3582054 under kemal atat rk a concerted effort was made to redefine turkeys political identity as a nation state on the european model committed to secular political values and institutional and economic modernization as a result most turks tend to see their country as being more a part of europe than of the middle east
3582055 no one can portray the akp as a focal point against secularism the 16 5 million people who voted for us did so believing in its values as a party which is democratic secular and is a supporter of the principles of social rule of law
3582056 six members of turkeys constitutional court voted to close it for violating the countrys secular principles but seven were required
3582057 by overcoming the case the party and its supporters have prevailed over the countrys staunchly secular old guard which has steered the country from behind the scenes since turkeys founding by atat rk in 1923
3582058 the militarys actions are justified on the grounds of the protection of the kemalist principles even though westernization as envisaged by atat rk entailed the subordination of the military to civilians
3582059 love means love for atat rk love means love for atat rks mother love means love for atat rks father
3582060 penalizes insulting turkishness the republic and the organs and institutions of the state
3582061 the restrictive jurisprudence established in 2006 by the court of cassation on the article 301 remains in force
3582062 the years in which atat rk imposed his secular revolution were not as progressive as turks are taught to believe
3582063 questioned the near monopoly that atat rk has on public statues and portraits
3582064 are we allowed to not love atat rk if im not going to get in trouble then no i dont
3582065 when atat rk received his authority from the sultan i dont think he was given it to create a secular republic if people are oppressing me in the name of kemalism then you cant expect me to like atat rk
3582066 anyone who publicly insults or curses the memory of atat rk shall be imprisoned with a heavy sentence of between one and three years
3582067 if the crimes outlined are committed publicly will have the penalty imposed increased by a proportion of one half
3582068 dinks killing was apparently politically and ethnically motivated he was identified by his murderers as an armenian who had been convicted in court for insulting turkishness
3582069 using the term genocide in a statement made to reuters news agency to describe the massacres of armenians in anatolia at the end of the ottoman empire
3582070 resum ing with real commitment the reform process aimed at adapting turkish laws to eu norms particularly removing article 301 of the penal code or redrafting it in a way that prevents its use in a manner incompatible with eu norms
3582071 us ing the mandate from the turkish electorate to build a strong pro reform political consensus that can marginalize secularist and nationalist scaremongers
3582072 a man may die nations may rise and fall but an idea lives on
3582073 one can say that kemalism will ultimately lose its power
3582074 indicates how tenuous atat rks legacy may be how easily it may disassemble with the right combination of charismatic leadership and the internal will to change

3582108 toen socrates en plato ermee begonnen het licht der rede te laten schijnen op de dynamiek van het aangetrokken worden van de mens door de mens lieten ze er geen twijfel over bestaan dat het verlangen van het subject naar de schone ander niet slechts zijn eigen particuliere opwelling kan zijn maar dat het tegelijkertijd moet worden opgevat als functie van een openbaar krachtenveld

3582110 geboren worden betekent voor de meeste borelingen de zege behalen over een muur
3582111 vanaf dat moment wordt het individu steeds meer gedwongen tot een fatale keuze uit twee dingen een koppige autistische eenzaamheid of zich laten verslinden door collectieve obsessies met zijn twee n of met velen op de weg naar de schijnbare autonomie ontstaat de mens zonder beschermgeest zonder amulet het zelf zonder ruimte

3582118 in dat opzicht is overgave de subjectvormende daad par excellennce want zich overgeven betekent moed vatten om wakker te zijn en wakker moeten we zijn om ons open te stellen voor de toon die ons betreft dit zichzelf verlaten is het eerste gebaar van het subject

3582122 de wonderlijke uitdrukking red perichorese staat voor niets minder dan de pretentieuze gedachte dat de personen niet in uiterlijke aan de fysica ontleende ruimtes kunnen worden gelokaliseerd maar dat ze de plaats waar ze zich bevinden zelf door middel van hun relatie cre ren
3582123 de poging om de buitenwereld in haar geheel in de bel op te nemen leidt tot formaatfouten want niets miskent de autonomie van microsferen en macrosferen zozeer als de poging om de duistere overbevolkte aarde in haar geheel simpelweg tot een transparant en homogeen thuis voor allen te maken
3582124 het in zijn is mede zijn met anderen maar verderop iedereen is de ander en niemand zichzelf dan wordt de catastrofe van de gedachte van de hechte binding manifest

3582168 der enge raum ordered space der gerichtet raum architectural space certainly exists independently of the casual perceiver and has centers and directions of its own a theory where space is really understood as a dimension of human existence rather than as a dimension of thought or perception page 14 from d frey the goal already contains the path as its point of reference directional indicator and ultimate end and movement from it or may encircle it all architecture is a structuring of space by means of a goal or path every house is an architecturally structured path the specific possibilities of movement and the drives towards movement as one proceeds from the entrance through the sequence of spatial entities have been pre determined by the architectural structuring of that space and one experiences the space accordingly but at the same time in its relation to the surrounding space it is a goal and we either advance towards this goal or depart from it page 15 from k lynch the word mat be organized around a set of focal points or be broken into named regions or be linked by remembered routes page 17 2 existential space this means firstly that the child learns to recognize that is to construct the world as a system of similarities and secondly that he connects the things recognized with particular places situating them in a more comprehensive totality a space from piaget the universe is built up into an aggregate of permanent objects connected by causal relations that are independent of t6he subject and are placed in space and time space is therefore the product of an interaction between the organism and the environment in which it is impossible to dissociate the organization of the universe perceived from that of the activity itself it is not enough to point out that space forms a necessary part of the structure of existence we ought also to describe this particular structure in detail the problem comprises two aspects abstract aspect consists of more general schemata of a topological or geometrical kind concrete aspects refer to the grasping of environmental elements landscape townscape buildings and physical things page 18 the first relations which bring order into the spaces are of a topological kind and are established even before form and size constancy we may say that the elementary organizational schemata consist in the establishment of centers or places proximity directions or paths continuity and areas or domains enclosure elements of existential space centre and place directions and path area and domain elementary interaction levels of existential space geography landscape the urban level townscape the house the thing the interaction of levels centre and place in terms of spontaneous perception mans space is subjectively centered in many legends the centre of the world is concretized as a tree or a pillar symbolizing a vertical axis mundi page 19 if the centre of the world thus designates an ideal public goal or lost paradise the word home also has a closer and more concrete meaning it simply tells us that any mans personal world has its center the odyssey however shows that the home too is easily lost and that it takes a hard journey to find it again all the centers are places of action places were particular activities are carried out or places of social interaction such as the homes of relatives and friends the actions in fact are only meaningful in relation to particular places and are coloured by the character of the places the places are goals or foci where we experience the meaningful events of our existence a place is characterized by a certain size page 20 from e t hall territoriality provides the frame in which things are done places to learn to play safe places to hide the personal space defined in the concept of territoriality should not however be confounded with existential space which to a large extent has a public character bringing the members of a society together in common places within this public space the individual finds his personal space the limited size of know places naturally goes together with a centralized form a centralized form primarily means concentration a place therefore is basically round the notion of proximity centralization and closure therefore work together to form a more concrete existential concept the concept of space and places are the basic elements of existential space direction and path the concept of place implies an inside and an outside and that existential space usually comprises many places a place is therefore situated within a larger context and cannot be understood in isolation any place contains directions page 21 aristotle recognized the qualitative distinctions above and below in front of and behind and right and left distinctions which are rooted in mans constitution and in his relationship to the gradational field the vertical direction expresses a rising up or falling down and has since remote times been endowed with a particular meaning the vertical therefore has always been considered the sacred dimension of space it represents a path towards a reality which may be higher of lower than daily life a reality that conquers gravity that is earthly existence or succumbs to it the vertical direction however also has a more concrete meaning it connection with the home it expresses the very process of building that is mans ability to conquer nature the horizontal directions represent mans concrete world of action the simplest model of mans existential space is therefore a horizontal plane pierced by a vertical axis on the plane man chooses and creates paths which give his existential space a more particular structure page 22 nature contains directions which indicate qualitative differences the roman city thus was organized around the cardo axis mundi running north south any landscape contains directions as well as determined spaces which help man in finding a foothold his possibilities for movement are limited and the path does not follow the mathematical rule that the shortest distance is the straight line rather than straight line hodological space contains preferred paths which represent a compromise between several domains such as short distance security minimal work maximum experience etc perceptually and as a schema any path is characterized by its continuity whereas the place is determined by the proximity of its defining elements and eventually by closure the path is imagined as a linear succession from k lynch people tended to think of path destinations and origin points page 23 area and domain paths divides mans environment into areas which are more or less well known domains the known domains are surrounded by a relatively unknown world determined by the directions north south east and west and geography in a certain sense the domains are places because they are defined by closure or by proximity as similarity of constituent elements the domain has a certain unifying function in existential space it fills out the image and makes it become a coherent space because of their general properties domains function as potential places for mans activities page 24 it is therefore clear that mans image of domains is influenced by physical and functional as well as social and cultural factors that is by the basis objects to which he has to orient elementary interaction when they places paths domains are combined space becomes a real dimension f human existence the existential space of nomadic people path oriented of early agricultural civilizations place oriented of the ancient egyptians destiny idea oriented an analysis of existential space therefore ought to start investigating the relative importance given to each of the basic elements page 25 when places interact with their surrounding a problem of inside and outside is created the inside of space becomes an expression of the inside of personality any closed form however has to be entered and a directions is thereby introduced this area is related to an opening which may be given various forms to express the degree of continuity in existential space the door is always open and closed the opening expresses what the place wants to be in relation to its environment a place is usually related to several directions by a system of paths these of ten a star around the center page 26 the paths are usually connected among themselves the result is network the relation between place and path and path creates abais dichotomy the tension between centralization and longitudinally the system of path together with the topographical conditions creates domains of varying density in our environmental image the domains with higher densities define amore neutral ground page 27 genius loci man recognized that different places have a different character this character is often so strong that in fact determines the basic properties of the environmental images of most people present making them feel that they experience and belong to the same place the genius loci in many cases has even proved strong enough to dominate any political social and cultural changes the levels of existential space the elements appear on several levels lowest level the hand the action of the hand next level the body in his actions third level the house movements territorial the urban level social interaction form of life the landscape level interaction natural environments geographical level different landscapes page 28 geography the geographical level has a cognitive character it is though rather than lived landscape the level of landscape has generally been that of the ground on which the configurations of existential space have developed any landscape offers a limited range of possibilities for orientation and identification it has a certain capacity determined by its structural properties landscape has a structure of its own page 29 the urban level determined by mans own activities that is by his interaction with a man made environment on this level the basic form is what could be called our place page 30 in general it corresponds to what is usually known as human scale from k lynch man needs an urban environment which facilitates the image making he needs districts which have a particular character path which lead somewhere and nodes which are distinct and unforgettable places the house the private spaces we find within the common urban level are houses in the fullest sense of the word the house really brings us inside and represents the need for being situated but there are also houses which have a public character this either means that they remain part of the urban level or that the public realm is recognized as an extension of the private world so that man can be said to dwell in the public buildings as well as in his house page 32 the thing they are connected with the basic actions of hiding and revealing of conserving and remembering the interaction of levels existential space can be described as a simultaneous totality where the levels interact to form a complex dynamic field in general we may say that existential space consists of several overlapping and inter penetrating systems which interact with each other for each person there is an optimal perceptual rate page 34 conclusion any activity has spatial aspects because any activity implies movements and relations to places the experience of space consists in the tension between ones immediate situation and existential space mobility presupposes a structured image of the environment an existential space which contains generalized as well as particular orientations today we ask what we should demand in order to make the environment a satisfactory part of human existence freedom still presupposes security and security is only possible through the human identity of which existential space is one aspect this is the essence of dwelling architectural space the elements of architectural space place and node path and axis domain and district the levels of architectural space landscape the urban level the house page 37 architectural space maybe defined as a concretization of existential space individual world public world scientific world in feedback page38 values influence our choice of alternatives they make our actions intentional we interpret the situation relative to a system of values the symbol function is basic to all human behaviour without symbols which concretise his value oriented being in the world man would be in expressive page 39 architectural space concretizes a public existential space which includes many private existential spaces

3582189 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3582190 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3582191 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

3582351 sorting is typically the bottleneck in database query plans and mapreduce jobs its all about i o or in this case how fast you can swap memory for example a 2 pass bitonic radix sort iteratively swaps the lows and the highs say you call memcpy in your c program on a 6 000 xeon machine the memory bandwidth is about 4 gb s do the equivalent on a 200 graphics co processor and you get about 50 gb s holy smokes i know im getting off topic here but why is it so much faster on a gpu well in cpu world memory access can be quite slow you have almost these random jumps in memory which can result in expensive tlb cache misses page faults etc you also have context switching for multi processing lots of overhead going on here now compare this with a gpu which has the memory almost stream directly to tons of cores the cores on a gpu are fairly cheap dumb processing units in comparison to the cores found in a cpu but the gpu uses hundreds of these cores in parallel to drastically speed up the overall processing this coupled with its specialized memory architecture results in amazing performance bandwidth also interestingly since these cores are cheap bad theres a lot of room for improvement at the current rate gpu advancements are occurring 3 4x faster than moores law for cpus additionally the graphical experience is near real life quality current apis enable developers to draw 3d triangles directly off the video card this is some amazing hardware folks gpus and generally this whole notion of co processing to optimize for operations that lag on cpus memory bandwidth i o promise to make future computers even faster than ever

3582442 the bianculli family has done an excellent job building their business and their new shredder means the blaze family of companies commands an even larger share of the scrap supply in the southeast
3582443 the idea is that when you process material with this type of shredder you get to a consistent size and get maximum recovery of nonferrous metals from the system it also will clean up the fluff material

3582466 third save for retirement fourth get rid of your debts at least those over 5 or so
3582467 you shouldn t pay down your mortgage or your student loans because of the tax benefits yes some debts have tax benefits and those should be looked at carefully but not overinflated on student loans you can deduct the paid interest each year but all extra payments will do is reduce the amount of interest you pay in future years just slightly reducing your deduction there

3582470 but he doesnt charge he doesnt ask for anything you dont even have to drink any medicine
3582471 he just looks at you and tells you whether or not he can help you if he can he uses some plants or some such shit my friend told me he told a guy to hunt a deer and then bring it to an altar and offer it as a sacrifice to god three days later he was all better

3582476 raw milk is raw milk whether it is sold or bartered or given away
3582477 there is the definition of raw milk which appears to require a sale there is the consumer who must apparently purchase in order for the milk she or he drinks to be regulated under law there is the milk plant which must apparently receive milk intended for pasteurization or not qualify as a milk plant respondents would have us hang our hats upon these inconsistencies find them dispositive and dismiss the states case to do so would fly in the face of common sense and defeat the clear legislative intent to cover the field of dairy regulation for the protection of public health
3582478 i conclude that the arrangement between its members and meadowsweet for the distribution of raw milk and raw milk products is not a purchase and sale transaction but is a distribution of profit based upon the value of the members contributions
3582479 it is well established that the law cannot be employed for an illegal purpose consequently while members may obtain raw milk and raw milk products at the farm as a distribution from the llc i find that the llc must be in compliance with applicable laws governing manufacture processing handling and distribution of dairy products
3582480 the north wall is caked with old manure chickens were found roaming free in the milking barn
3582481 the department offered no evidence that there was any actual injury to the public or any intent to deceive consumers by offering product which was not what it was purported to be
3582482 the departments evidence establishes beyond doubt that the conditions at meadowsweet in october of 2007 were not sanitary that the products produced processed and manufactured there may have been contaminated with filth or rendered diseased unwholesome or injurious to health
3582483 yes it cioppino is italian its a mediterranean dish not unlike bouillabaisse and like bouillabaisse there are countless variations and everyone thinks theirs is the only true version there are enough versions that the two probably overlap
3582484 to be precise there is an italian american dish called cioppino undoubtedly based on the ligurian ciuppin which means nearly any sort of fish or seafood zuppa
3582485 were dealing in essence with a fish soup put through a food mill thats closely related to the soupe of the french
3582486 however it shouldnt be confused with bouillabaisse ciuppins roots which are common to all fish stews lie in the use of the leftovers of the catch or the market stall its therefore a mixture of a number of kinds of fish all of limited commercial value cooked with greens herbs and olive oil only with time did it develop into the refined rich dish we know today its made throughout the riviera ligure but is more common in the levante the eastern part of the ligurian coast towards tuscany especially lavagna chiavari and sestri which appears to hold the copyright on the name
3582487 therell be whales and snails and oyster stew shell fish jell fish and pompano too and rocks and flocks of little white bait mussels and clams and succulent skate illegible line ed oiled and boiled and tempered with thyme in pot and pan will bubble and brew with dabs and crabs and dragon sharks fin and vats of wine for all to swim in

3582493 she has a tremendous drive to do well to be a champion to succeed
3582494 when i didnt make the 2004 olympic team i started wondering if i should pursue track and field or use my economics degree
3582495 it was very hard but im sure im not the only athlete who has been through that
3582496 my main goal was not track but college i wanted to be the first in my family to graduate college
3582497 i told her she didnt have to pay any rent that she could just go to school and go to track practice

3582504 weve been lobbying the shops not to buy kwila furniture for next season of course some dont care but we are on the point of getting there in terms of making people aware of the issues
3582505 the illegal destruction of forests in indonesia is a major concern because its contributing to global warming the timber is being cut in indonesia then exported to vietnam and china where its made into furniture for export

3582511 jerome paid for his lack of physical freshness which is linked to his struggle to lose weight
3582512 age was also a factor its easier to lose weight when youre 20 than 29 he just lacked that little energy and power because he wasnt fresh enough because of his weight problems
3582513 i knew they were going to give him everything he wanted
3582514 ive been watching the scoring here the first four days and i knew it was bad so i was expecting it
3582515 you expect a slight bias for the home team but you come to the olympic games and expect a level playing field joe didnt box the best ive seen him but the scoring makes a difference and the tactics had to be changed because of the scoring
3582516 everything the chinese guy touched they pressed the button for him
3582517 we are going to take on an underdog role in this ryder cup for the first time in a long time even on paper when you look at the strength of the european squad
3582518 ive said all along that experience while being very important i mean weve lost five of the last six ryder cups so most of their experiences are bad experiences so its not like experience is going to be a great help im looking for guys that are playing well its as simple as that and if its an experienced player playing well then i think thats fantastic
3582519 we will contest every seat where we have a viable candidate
3582520 the challenge is there it is there to be done but i dont think it can be done in a year or two
3582521 we might not have the biggest squad this season and we might not have the best squad in the premier league because there are some big clubs out there with big squads and a lot of quality players
3582522 but we can be the fittest team and that is what we have tried to do
3582523 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race

3582541 the tragic effect of these events upon your son who i have no doubt you love sincerely is one of the most disturbing features of this crime
3582542 weve lost a lot of dedicated experienced officers its very sad seeing these guys go but i understand why theyre leaving
3582543 as soon as they started talking about it back in february we saw crime jump
3582544 criminals know were short staffed now were seeing people coming here from richmond and oakland because they think its fertile ground
3582545 i think for the police to say they cant handle certain crimes is completely irresponsible disrespectful and for people who live here very threatening
3582546 im here because i love vallejo but its a simple numbers game the more cops we have the more effective we can be
3582547 we just moved here from richmond and ive slept better than i have in years
3582548 theres not as many sirens or ambulances i feel much safer here and i think the police have been great
3582549 theres a lot of stuff going on in this town and i worry about the young people theres nothing for them to do but get in trouble
3582550 you can add another 100 officers and break ins will still happen because were in a tight economy
3582551 community policing and getting to know your neighbors is the way to reduce crime not putting more officers in cars
3582552 they say were the cash cow that broke the city its not true but the upshot is that we feel unwanted
3582553 one drive was halfway decent but the first ones werent that good

3582572 one of the things that has become clear to us through working with people training for the marathon is that in order to maintain a positive attitude about training and running it is necessary to develop a positive attitude about life in general
3582573 the most important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well

3582575 we had a lot of work to do obviously to get in a position where apple and at amp t would feel good about best buy mobile carrying it and thats what weve done in the last 18 months

3582580 about two days ago i got pretty upset because since ive been here theyve tested me four times and they took blood a lot of blood
3582581 they are taking so much blood i am going to be very weak before the final of the 100 meters
3582582 he knows about it so its a bit strange he would complain
3582583 hes possibly exaggerating about the four tests but certainly he is part of the program he knows he will be tested more often
3582584 the point is its a good thing if hes been tested a lot
3582585 hes a favorite for the 100 meters so why not
3582586 blood tested once and urine tested once since ive been here
3582587 its what im doing to show my love for my sport
3582588 it comes with the territory past champions have tested positive but an olympic champion needs to carry himself clean to be clean and to be able to prove hes clean
3582589 they are saying that they are doing like over 4 000 tests but its just very difficult
3582590 but hopefully they can make these olympic games very clean
3582591 why rural families are voting democratic taking back red california
3582592 when we strengthen our rural communities we lift up our entire nation
3582593 i think that people who live in rural areas can feel confident that im not a newcomer to this
3582594 that was the important thing thats really what were attempting to do is win series and go from there
3582595 to win three out of four against their pitching staff is pretty good
3582596 theyve got an outstanding staff and getting three is big
3582597 i also know im capable of pitching badly and it can change in a heartbeat
3582598 it appears that swimming is benefiting from a number of interesting stories this year including michael phelps race for gold dara torres return to the games and park win to bring home s first ever gold medal in swimming

3582600 about two days ago i got pretty upset because since ive been here theyve tested me four times and they took blood a lot of blood
3582601 they are taking so much blood i am going to be very weak before the final of the 100 meters

3582611 if you have the money you can afford to get the best in sports science recruit people that have been in other countries and get athletes funding that enables them to become full time athletes
3582612 but regardless of that i still firmly believe that in everything that we do we are still leaders
3582613 it wasnt easy to come back after the blow of the 400 where i handled the race badly
3582614 the key this time was instinct my coach told me to follow my instincts and that was the best way for me
3582615 ive reached three great aims gold the world record and getting past the wall of 1 55
3582616 i typed the word google into google guess what came up everything
3582617 you know whats fun go to a german restaurant and insist on using chopsticks
3582618 i typed the word google into google guess what came up everything
3582619 you know whats fun go to a german restaurant and insist on using chopsticks

3582622 what happened to your gatech scholarship why are you not going there
3582623 theres no way to make everybody happy when i do one thing that a lot of people want theres always the opposite reaction but how can you possibly meet up with the expectations that this book had
3582624 it just got so built up there is no book in the world that could stand up to that so i knew it was going to happen but at the same time it hurts
3582625 we feel that the use of the word retard throughout the film 15 or more times is done without any regard for the dignity of people with intellectual disabilities
3582626 a demeaning and degrading parody of a person with intellectual disabilities
3582627 what can we do to counteract this use this really as an opportunity to tell people about the abilities of people with intellectual disabilities about the value and dignity that they want to live with
3582628 im sorry that they have this opinion i know that the people organizing it have not even seen the film i think in the context of the movie its really clear where were coming from but it was not meant to offend anybody
3582629 if i want to protest something because it offends me thats my right as an american and its also in the artists right to say and do whatever they want to do

3582631 note that further detailed studies will be required to fix precise road alignments widths and connecting routes
3582632 i feel the only justification for this alignment is the development investigation area and i do not believe its a proper timeframe
3582633 this perimeter road is considerably larger than the one in the original strategy approved by the western australian planning commission
3582634 its interesting to note that when consultants came back in july it was a much larger perimeter road
3582635 this is poor unintelligent planning the traffic will use more fuel travelling further than it needs to
3582636 we have had very few trucks heading south and those that do would be accommodated travelling along rosa brook sues road
3582637 i would hate to think we sat on our hands and had a fatality
3582638 the previous council washed their hands of the affair they said it was too hard
3582639 one reason for the bulge is to avoid the top end of darch brook
3582640 the process of getting funding for the road is slow and frustrating but that doesnt mean we give up
3582641 its not about selling the road to anybody or doing deals that are untoward
3582642 trucks arent using the other roads its easier to come through town centre
3582643 a bypass that cuts the town in two would be unintelligent planning
3582644 no no its not me thats weird im just unique and you cant understand that no there can only be something wrong with you you narrow minded nasty person why youre exactly like a nazi
3582645 public misperception might view turning an environment centre into a toilet block as a graphic portrayal of the shires attitude towards the environment
3582646 environmental regard is rapidly becoming a mainstream concern and things that only five years ago were regarded as radical such as the abolition of plastic shopping bags are being embraced with enthusiasm
3582647 we know the shire has a number of great environmental initiatives but the environment centre is a valuable community resource
3582648 we propose that the shire build composting toilets adjacent to the current building rather than toilets inside the current building
3582649 these are the perfect example of a towards zero waste initiative as articulated in the recent waste strategy
3582650 we want to provide was own equine stampede through professional organised sports and entertainers that will showcase australias equine heritage
3582651 the horse is so much a part of australias cultural identity
3582652 the labor strategy was to use the busselton hospital in vasse as an excuse to downgrade the margaret river hospital
3582653 however under a liberal government there is no link between the provision of the busselton hospital and the downgrading of the margaret river health facility
3582654 the margaret river hospital will continue to play a vital part under the liberal future health policy
3582655 the significant growth of the south west region as well as the great expanse of this area justifies well resourced hospitals in both busselton and margaret river
3582656 by health minister jim mcgintys admission the future of margaret river hospital would be compromised by the development of the busselton hospital at vasse
3582657 i have had had discussions with the communities in both busselton and margaret river on this issue and the overwhelming response has been very much the same
3582658 when it comes to regular and emergency hospital healthcare distances to travel are a major area of concern along for local communities
3582659 the reality is no one knows what growth rates are going to be
3582660 with this recommendation we will get growth that is planned and controlled
3582661 theres nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed or afraid of
3582662 the only conclusion we can come to is that we have sufficient land already for 2026
3582663 i think its been told by so many people that made submissions and as councillors we should take due regard of them and back them up
3582664 i feel if i dont take them into account i would be incompetent as a councillor
3582665 we need to provide as a council for the next 15 years in regards to projections for future growth
3582666 im very confident from the information and recommendations that we will have orderly and managed growth for this town in the next 15 years
3582667 we dont build to be held to ransom by one developer
3582668 and we cant tell what the futures going to be
3582669 what you will do in the event of something happening
3582670 i agree with cr smart these are dias possible investigation area theres no development zonings
3582671 the document doesnt say here you go ben start it it doesnt allow people to do things willy nilly all over the place
3582672 this approach is competent i believe our officers have done a superb job

3582680 they need to play too theyve done a nice job here
3582681 were pulling for him ive never said i was disappointed all ive said basically was that wed like to see him start hitting and it created a stir
3582682 to his credit hes continued to hustle and hes played really well in right field hes just in a little bit of a slump probably trying to do too much
3582683 he needs just to do the things that hes capable of like he was earlier in the year hes taking less pitches hes not working the count the way he was earlier he just needs to swing at more strikes
3582684 you try to find somebody else thats swinging the bat
3582685 it created a stir and if thats the case im sorry
3582686 and you know what he probably is but i think we give him one more and then we put him back into the closers role
3582687 i have a very good relationship with my first wife
3582688 my marriages collapse was attributable to my own selfishness and immaturity the blame was entirely mine
3582689 he kind of chased me around the hors doeuvre table
3582690 i was trying to get something to eat and i thought this guys kind of weird i was kind of trying to get away from him
3582691 so to be honest i always wanted to i never liked only being able to see your legs
3582692 you saw my face you saw my face you saw my faaaace
3582693 we aim to cut customers time and costs by handling all the hassle of a logistics service and yet to be perceived as being part or our customers organisation

3582699 if you dont come out of there right now im going to go get my mom and shell break the door open
3582700 i just dont understand why youd have that sign on the door when its not true
3582701 we just got tired of people coming into the store and seeing that it was filled with books only books and still asking us if we had anything else i mean if we had anything else dont youd think wed display it
3582702 but you do have other stuff you have those dresses and that horse stuff
3582703 please do not pursue the chinchillas if they want you to touch them theyll come to you
3582704 they always accused me of wanting to bring politics into the olympics and that the arab countries would walk out
3582705 the saddest thing for me is to see what happened in new york on 9 11 and get the feeling if people responded the right way 30 years ago and the world said this cannot be that things might have been different
3582706 alirezaei swims in lane one and the representative of the zionist regime in lane seven so they will not face each other
3582707 he confirmed this in writing to the swimming federation we also spoke to iranian association and they have underlined to us that all athletes competing here are in the right spirit to compete against athletes of any nationalities
3582708 we take both the athletes and the noc had their words on this
3582709 it wont leak in your pocket and make you pregnant
3582710 it takes a strong man to make a tender chicken
3582711 it takes an aroused man to make a chicken affectionate
3582712 we are all familiar with the holocaust against the people when this happens we feel bad and we vow never to let it happen again we need to seriously examine what human beings are doing to the earth and the environment many species are extinct and many more will become extinct during the next 10 years we are methodically eliminating life that will never return again today we should take time to pray real hard so we wake up before it is too late
3582713 since wars begin in the minds of men it is in the minds of men that we have to erect the ramparts of peace
3582714 will step out of the cart and exit through the c corridor
3582715 theres just a stool and a metal box hanging off the wall
3582716 recite a brief factual essay based on the image provided
3582717 there are many poverty stricken countries in africa sometimes people from the united states visit them to help the starving people sometimes people from the united states visit them to go on a safari you have to get a series of shots before you can go though
3582718 describe your feelings towards the idea of the intelligence test and why you think it was instated
3582719 i think that the idea of an intelligence test is really quite brilliant because it has the capability to weed out the intellectual weak links in the chain of people at this camp when all the weak spots are gone the chain in indestructible i think that the intelligence test was instated for exactly that reason
3582720 press in order as fast as you can repeat until time is up
3582721 the test is now over thank you for your time you may exit the way you came in tests can be stressful so head over to the cafeteria for a slice of cake as your reward
3582722 i think i did well but im not sure but i know i did better than the man who went before me so at least ill live to see tomorrow
3582723 weve got my mom and dad your mom and dad my brother
3582724 younger painters have not had the courage to change to do anything different
3582725 he has been uncompromising he has not changed in five decades of painting abstracts
3582726 they have become lighter and lighter since he moved to norway
3582727 theres much more blue which could be a result of his living in norway or because of the stage of his life
3582728 all thinking is a reflection of what you are living with and i dont wish to paint that
3582729 profound thinking and great depth in both his life and art
3582730 very distinct even in his non representational work which unlike others is shorn of iconic meditative symbolism instead theres constant movement a restlessness strokes chasing strokes
3582731 is totally abstract our thinkers were abstract but later thinkers like our artists have become smug
3582732 you have to break through in search of new awareness
3582733 he has been respected all along but if recognition depends on sales on how many lakhs a painting is worth then yes it has been slow in coming
3582734 since wars begin in the minds of men it is in the minds of men that we have to erect the ramparts of peace
3582735 jika ahli pahlimen bukan islam lebih ramai daripada ahli parlimen islam pas tidak akan menyertai kerajaan pakatan rakyat if they take over on 16 9 setelah 50 tahun orang melayu memerintah negara ini tetapi jika orang bukan melayu mengambilalih ia sukar kepada negara dan rakyat jika ahli parlimen bukan islam lebih ramai ia akan mengugat orang islam

3582737 any problem with record keeping and documentation in aircraft maintenance is a concern because thats one of the things that underpins the safety of the plane
3582738 is it just a maintenance documentation problem or was there a failure to do any maintenance work
3582739 the proof is left as an exercise to the reader
3582740 when the picture comes out its rainbow at first then it develops into the actual picture its really cool

3582743 why cant you girls just wear regular clothes like the rest of us
3582744 although i am young i have lived a full life please if i attack you no matter how much you love or care about me do not hesitate to take me down i can only hurt you now
3582745 we had a lot of work to do obviously to get in a position where apple and at amp t would feel good about best buy mobile carrying it and thats what weve done in the last 18 months
3582746 would not be in the best interest of the community
3582747 she was very pleased at the division of paroles decision
3582748 the growth data matched expectations not giving strongincentives for the market to trade on
3582749 certainly a stronger dollar and lower oil prices are a helpfor the market but an end to worry about overseas banks wouldhelp one hundred times more one thousand times more
3582750 how long will this go on the more time passes the worse itseems to get
3582751 hello hello this is your body what do you want my body i wanna feel somebody on me
3582752 my parents are gone for the weekend so party at my place then you need to get out of the club watch and report back when youre ready to bust some moves

3582756 jadi kalo kalian tidak bisa melihatnya tuhan itu ada atau tidak
3582757 we continue to evaluate our liquidity and our alternatives to improve the balance sheet
3582758 well continue to look at that to make sure that we have adequate liquidity to successfully implement this very significant kind of transformation
3582759 that is our intent but also i dont want to walk away from the fact that theres lots of variables hitting this business every day
3582760 our role is to make sure that were as flexible as we can be to kind of take those things coming at us both the good and the bad
3582761 what we really need to do is tell people that were back in the car business
3582762 we have a real opportunity on our hand over the next couple of years to show people that we have world class cars that were bringing here to the u s
3582763 when those start stabilizing it has a positive effect on consumer sentiment but it also has a positive effect in the banking community because they know that their asset base theyre not going to have to write it down the next quarter
3582764 instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea
3582765 university teachers should simply accept as variant spelling those words our students most commonly misspell
3582766 in the present circumstances no one can afford to assume that someone else will solve their problems every individual has a responsibility to help guide our global family in the right direction good wishes are not sufficient we must become actively engaged

3582768 the mexican cabdrivers poem for his wife who has left him
3582769 shes like my cup of 8am coffee warm inviting nice to wake up to and hot oh and black
3582770 she spoke about everything in her life like it was morning traffic she was stuck in it and oblivious to the fact that she was part of the problem
3582771 her smile was like a fluorescent light uncomfortably bright and unnatural
3582772 shes like a stapler biting down as hard as she can just to keep it all together
3582773 shes like the thumbtacks on my cubicle wall colorful sharp but ultimately tacky
3582774 she was like that tree that i looked at with hope outside the office window so close but the few feet screamed of our distance
3582775 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3582776 i ask the spirit of all humans born if they wish to see their wondrous sun dim in their polluted skies do you desire that your sky be filled with putrid and deadly chemicals
3582777 do you despise your lives so much that you would destroy every beautiful stream and kill every lake do you desire that your oceans be polluted and devoid of all life
3582778 do you wish to continue to believe the madmen who claim that our mother earth is to be destroyed do you desire that your mother world die will you pollute her to the point where you and your children cannot survive
3582779 do you wish for your breath to be taken away from you because it is fouled with toxic gases can you understand that you cannot hate life and then expect life to endure your madness do you desire that your world be destroyed
3582780 since wars begin in the minds of men it is in the minds of men that we have to erect the ramparts of peace
3582781 michael phelps makes me sick why does he have to win everything
3582782 ik heb mijn hele leven in synagogen doorgebracht en heb bijna alle oude boeken gelezen maar geen profeet heeft zoveel geweld gebruikt als deze mohammed na de faraos heeft geen enkele figuur uit de historie de joden zoveel pijn gedaan als mohammed deze slimme mohammed heeft bijna tweederde van zijn boek aangedikt met de verhalen uit onze thora maar overal in zijn boek heeft hij de joden vervloekt mohammad was geen boodschapper hij was de profeet der dieven
3582783 hij mohammed beweerde dat de god van jezus en allah gelijk zijn maar hij wist dat dat niet waar was de god van jezus heeft niets met allah te maken
3582784 there comes a time when all life on earth is in danger at this time great powers have arisen barbarian powers although these powers have wasted their wealth in preparing to annihilate each other they have much in common weapons of unfathomable devastation and technologies that lay waste to the world it is just at this point when the future of all beings seems to be hanging by the frailest of threads that the kingdom of shambhala emerges
3582785 because its not a geopolitical entity it exists in the hearts and minds of the shambhala warriors
3582786 you cant recognize a shambhala warrior by looking at him or her
3582787 because they dont wear uniforms no insignias they wave no banners they dont even have barricades on which to climb to threaten the enemy or hide behind to rest or to regroup they dont have any home turf ever and always they move on the terrain of the barbarian powers
3582788 great courage is required of the shambhala warrior moral courage and physical courage because the warriors are going right into the heart of the barbarian powers to dismantle the weapons theyre going into the citadels and the pits and pockets where the weapons are stored weapons in every sense of the word theyre going into the corridors of power where decisions are made in order to dismantle the weapons that threaten all life on earth
3582789 since wars begin in the minds of men it is in the minds of men that we have to erect the ramparts of peace
3582790 many contemplative traditions speak of loving kindness as the wish for happiness for others and of compassion as the wish to relieve others suffering loving kindness and compassion are central to the dalai lamas philosophy and mission
3582791 we wanted to see how this voluntary generation of compassion affects the brain systems involved in empathy
3582792 we used audio instead of visual challenges so that meditators could keep their eyes slightly open but not focused on any visual stimulus as is typical of this practice
3582793 the insula is extremely important in detecting emotions in general and specifically in mapping bodily responses to emotion such as heart rate and blood pressure and making that information available to other parts of the brain
3582794 both of these areas have been linked to emotion sharing and empathy
3582795 the combination of these two effects which was much more noticeable in the expert meditators as opposed to the novices was very powerful
3582796 people are not just stuck at their respective set points
3582797 we can take advantage of our brains plasticity and train it to enhance these qualities
3582798 thinking about other peoples suffering and not just your own helps to put everything in perspective

3582800 weve learned that the nf1 gene affects stature through a different pathway than the one weve previously focused on to understand cancers in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1
3582801 given that this second pathway has been linked to cancer in other contexts we may need to consider the possibility that it is contributing to these tumors and alter our treatment goals accordingly

3582807 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3582808 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3582809 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim
3582810 the last thing you want is for people to think youre making fun of the victims in this who are having their lives turned into fodder for people to win oscars

3582830 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3582831 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3582832 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3582833 the russians have clearly overreacted but president saakashvili for some reason seems to think he has a hall pass from this administration
3582834 we knew they were going to go crack heads we told them again and again not to do this
3582835 we thought we had an understanding with the russians that any response would be south ossetia focused clearly its not
3582836 i would say that we mostly were focused elsewhere unlike during the cold war when wed see a single soviet armor battalion move so yes the size and scope of the russian move has come as something of a surprise

3582848 were still going to see food price inflation but it could have been much much worse had we not had the almost perfect weather since the middle of june
3582849 the first few crop reports of the year are guesses
3582850 this one gives you the first solid idea of what the crop really looks like
3582851 now we have the double benefit of not paying higher prices for flour and having a better more efficient operation in place
3582852 even if corn is cheaper today than it has been recently its still very expensive by historic standards you cant make an easy argument that because corn is down 3 then food prices are coming down

3582858 work is either fun or drudgery it depends on your attitude i like fun
3582859 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3582860 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3582861 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3582862 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3582863 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3582864 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3582865 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3582868 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3582869 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3582870 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3582871 maybe i should have spent a little more on those seat cushions
3582872 work is either fun or drudgery it depends on your attitude i like fun

3582877 he made a small mistake but at the olympics you cant wrestle with a small mistake
3582878 while he was an iconic figure to many to us he was husband father and friend we will ever miss his love wisdom humor and the familiar comfort of his voice
3582879 wow i dont know if they ever had it but they certainly dont have it now
3582880 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3582881 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3582882 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3582883 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3582897 la debilidad de los galos es que son inconstantes en sus determinaciones les gusta el cambio y no se puede confiar en ellos

3582923 i am absolutely certain that generations from now we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
3582924 now we know the truth that these forces were there to rebuild the railway to allow ammunition and other military supplies to aid a russian invasion
3582925 you have to be so careful what you say because then these countries misunderstand that you might come to help them so weve got that problem right now in georgia they thought wed come to help them and they thought that would insulate them the administration tried to warn them dont get the russian bear angry the georgians made a little bit of a mistake and theyre paying a heavy price

3582933 watak watak dan nama yang disebutkan ezam waktu itu berbeza dengan watak yang berlaku tetapi jalan cerita atau plot dramanya sama
3582934 sehari sebelum saiful hilang difahamkan tiga hari sebelum membuat laporan polis beliau berbual bual dengan kami tanpa menunjukkan sebarang apa apa yang pelik berlaku
3582935 beliau menyapa kami siap dengan senyuman lagi tetapi apabila tuduhan ini dibuat ke atas bos anwar kami amat terkejut
3582936 yang sahihnya saiful berjumpa dengan ezam sehari sebelum saiful membuat laporan polis ke atas anwar rakan rakan lain juga ada mereka tidak dibenarkan menyertai perbincangan empat mata antara ezam dengan saiful

3582939 the decision was based purely on numbers on performance and carpenter has outperformed him right now thats the bottom line
3582940 we chart a ton of categories with the kickers and carpenter has outperformed him

3582942 ive got to work on my kickoffs and keep going with my field goals of course it was a shock im a rookie coming in and jays a great kicker and hes got a lot of experience and im just here to do my best and hopefully thats the best
3582943 first of all the kids kicked in montana so i dont know much about anything but i know that montanas not always good weather
3582944 secondly when youre a rookie no matter what it is going into that kind of environment or this environment in practice right now youre kicking in pressure situations especially and with all due respect when you have a veteran player like jay feely who is a competitor competing against you and this kid competed
3582945 youve just got to keep encouraging him and hes been doing well so far there are always going to be trials and when that comes just kind of encourage him through that and tell him to keep his head up he looked like the same guy that weve been kicking with throughout all of camp i cant say i saw a different swagger or anything
3582946 every time i practice i expect to play last week against the bucs was his sparanos decision im practicing now and im just going to take it day by day and at the end of the day he still has the final decision

3582948 i actually met one of the head chapter guys of big brothers big sisters and told him i was actually trying to be involved here in miami and everything took off from there
3582949 it definitely makes it all worthwhile to know that we can be an influence and that we are role models and the fact there are good guys out there and good nfl players and to see the looks on their faces is great because you know you are making an impact

3582985 sewaktu kami memasuki ruang duduk tampak jelas kelegaan sukarno atas kedatangan kami kehadiran kami rupanya memberi pengaruh yang menenangkan karena sukarno telah menguasai kembali gejolak emosinya sukarno menceritakan kepada kami bahwa para pemuda tersebut telah datang untuk mendesaknya mengambil tindakan dalam hubungan proklamasi kemerdekaan
3582986 jika kalian siap menyatakan sendiri kemerdekaan cobalah saya ingin tahu kesanggupan kalian
3582987 jika ini pendapat bung silahkan kami para pemuda tidak dapat membenarkan penundaan proklamasi lewat siang atau besok kami para pemuda akan mengambil tindakan tindakan dan membuktikan kesanggupan kami seperti bung kehendaki
3582988 sesuatu yang tidak mungkin karena stasiun radio masih dikuasai balatentara jepang yang memiliki persenjataan lengkap
3582989 jika bung karno tidak mengeluarkan pengumuman malam ini juga akan berakibat terjadinya suatu pertumpahan darah dan pembunuhan besar besaran esok hari
3582990 ini batang leherku seretlah saya ke pojok itu dan potonglah leherku malam ini juga kamu tidak usah menunggu esok hari
3582991 saya secara diam diam setuju dengan pendapatnya karena bagaimana mungkin kami meninggalkan para anggota panitia persiapan kemerdekaan yang akan bersidang hari esoknya di pejambon kini gedung pancasila
3582992 jepang adalah masa silam kita sekarang harus menghadapi belanda yang akan berusaha untuk kembali menjadi tuan di negeri kita ini jika saudara tidak setuju dengan apa yang telah saya katakan dan mengira bahwa saudara telah siap dan sanggup untuk memproklamasikan mengapa saudara tidak memproklamasikan kemerdekaan itu sendiri mengapa meminta sukarno untuk melakukan hal itu

3583030 weve seen from the perth experience that it has forced a number of independent operators out of business

3583042 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3583043 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3583044 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3583045 imperial life in the emerald city inside iraqs green zone
3583046 the u s will continue to live with this burden for years to come
3583047 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3583048 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3583049 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3583050 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3583051 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3583052 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3583053 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3583054 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3583055 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3583056 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3583057 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3583058 the value cannot be less than or equal to zero

3583106 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odors
3583107 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionarily speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
3583108 and if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby
3583109 the pill is in effect mirroring a natural shift but at an inappropriate time

3583113 while we have corrected limited toos spring merchandising difficulties the macroeconomic trends we began to see affecting limited too in the last several quarters accelerated dramatically in the second quarter
3583114 we dont see these macroeconomic trends changing anytime soon and believe we will be well positioned to capitalize on these trends through our single store brand strategy
3583115 the price the farmer gets is just a fraction of what you pay in the store and its dropping all the time

3583135 focus the ministry of sic culture and heritage on its core functions
3583136 require all state funding agencies to place a greater emphasis on emerging artists
3583137 this means that as wages go up in these handicraft services

3583147 with the name school their attending as well as the bus number and bus stop to make sure that those kids are getting on and off their buses at the right place
3583148 the immediate area surrounding the school is where youre gonna see the biggest impact but youre also gonna see that impact in neighborhoods where buses are constantly stopping as well as on the interstates where theyre gonna be making their way onto the highways
3583149 because traffic is already flowing and school buses dont stop on the interstate
3583150 on the interstates probably a better chance to get into an accident as far as in the neighborhoods i would say its a reduced chance because people are going a little bit slower and have much more of an opportunity to stop
3583151 if you get stuck behind that bus thats gonna make 7 or 8 stops in front of you if youre 15 or 20 cars back by the time you get to a point where you can pass that bus that bus has pretty much made all of its stops

3583286 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3583287 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3583288 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3583289 im done getting in the middle of this and defending this

3583293 the only time a spouses interests cease to be those of the city official is when the divorce is finalized by the court
3583294 it really comes down to a factual question what did the official know and when did the official know it
3583295 if the official did know it theres clearly a problem there
3583296 you would not automatically say the official is in violation if the official can say theres no way i knew about this the separation does matter in my mind its a whole different relationship at that point
3583297 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3583298 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3583299 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

3583303 theres a boy in that house and he threw a rock at us and were going to get him
3583304 threw a rock at you huh and i suppose you did nothing to deserve that my son threw a rock at you for no reason at all
3583305 maybe you guys should get on home and stop staring at my house
3583306 nah bullshit we absolutely want to hurt each other but now we know that adults know about these plans and we cant administer the beatings we so desperately yearn for
3583307 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

3583309 oh no mary i said the minister has a hairpiece
3583310 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3583311 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3583312 the lineup is extremely diverse with major label bands indie bands and unsigned bands
3583313 indy metal fest was a well organized event that rivals most festivals in the u s
3583314 im really excited that were able to expand the size and scope of imf this year which is due in large part to the support weve received from the community
3583315 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3583316 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3583317 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3583318 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3583319 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

3583321 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3583322 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3583323 we are thrilled to announce the continued growth of the rics americas member base and the expansion of our team to support that growth
3583324 we have grown rapidly since rics americas was incorporated in 2001 nearly doubling our qualified membership since and we look forward to the ongoing maturity development and success of our organization in north america canada and the caribbean
3583325 there is no other association in the world that compares to rics when it comes to providing the public with useful information and establishing international standards i am thrilled to be part of the rics americas team
3583326 every major global real estate organization is represented in rics membership in this organization truly helps to advance members careers and earning potential both nationally and internationally
3583327 the growth of rics americas is a testament to the important need for leadership in establishing international standards and helping professionals navigate the increasingly global property marketplace
3583328 building from our experience of creating european standards and policies for over a century rics has a special focus on the americas and looks forward to continued expansion in the region
3583329 but guess what state worker says if you just come over here to visit two times yondalla can call him and tell him that everything is okay and then we can have regular visits

3583331 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3583332 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3583333 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3583334 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3583335 my goggles were filling up with water during the race and i had trouble seeing the wall
3583336 i wanted the world record i wanted a 1 51 or better but given the circumstances its not too bad i guess

3583338 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

3583340 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3583341 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3583342 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3583343 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3583344 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3583345 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3583346 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3583347 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3583348 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3583349 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3583350 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3583351 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3583352 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3583353 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3583354 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3583355 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3583356 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3583357 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3583358 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3583359 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3583360 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3583361 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3583362 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3583363 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3583364 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3583365 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3583366 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3583367 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3583368 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3583369 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3583370 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3583371 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3583372 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3583373 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3583374 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3583375 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3583376 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3583377 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3583378 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3583379 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3583380 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

3583406 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3583407 im not upset that you lied to me im upset that from now on i cant believe you

3583412 the bitterness of poor quality lingers long after the sweetness of low price fades away
3583413 there is hardly anything in the world that some man can not make a little worse and sell a little cheaper and the people who consider price only are this mans lawful prey
3583414 the study has a very pro exercise message if you had to pick one thing to make people healthier as they age it would be aerobic exercise
3583415 the health benefits of exercise are greater than we thought
3583416 this research re confirms the clear benefits of regular exercise for older people
3583417 exercise can help older people to stay mobile and independent ensure a healthy heart keep weight and stress levels under control and promote better sleep
3583418 while younger people are barraged with encouragement to lead healthier lifestyles the health needs of older people are often overlooked
3583419 you have enough time to tell me who created you
3583420 i i cant oh please just dont shoot me if you do this whole place goes sky high
3583421 do you mind not fucking smoking by my window how bout i just call the cops
3583422 because the soldiers dont pay a dime our waiver of the fees amounts to a discount to the military not a discount to soldiers
3583423 soldiers should not have to pay a penny of it
3583424 thats a lot to ask when the service member has much more important things on their minds such as staying alive and keeping those around them alive
3583425 this should not be a very difficult decision to make
3583426 while ata cannot by law even suggest uniform pricing policies to our members we will bring this matter to their attention for their independent consideration
3583427 air transport association member airlines have always been committed to supporting our nations military
3583428 airlines routinely offer special fares for military personnel and families attempt when possible to accommodate unplanned schedule changes and generally seek to do what they can to show their appreciation
3583429 we can help them with additional expenses for travel but soldiers have to submit a receipt and it has to be looked at by our finance people

3583449 washington will take a very careful look at the support announced by canada quebec and the u k
3583450 faa management in washington has the technology to know about every loss of separation in every facility across the country as soon as it occurs
3583451 to blame local managers for covering up losses of separation is the height of hypocrisy
3583452 weve worked very closely with industry to garner as much input with respect to what is operationally feasible
3583453 the new security proposals must be workable and should strike the right balance between the need for security and for mobility
3583454 having a program like this will make private planes even more secure

3583460 gigantic experiment i think with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
3583461 why else are we facing all these challenges climate change and everything
3583462 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3583463 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3583464 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3583465 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3583466 for to me to live is christ and to die is gain
3583467 this is something that must be brought to the notice to all lawyers and law students discussing legal and ethical issues and i think that there is no better platform than lawandotherthings
3583468 all persons are entitled to call upon the assistance of a lawyer of their choice to protect and establish their rights and to defend them in all stages of criminal proceedings
3583469 an advocate is bound to accept any brief in the courts or tribunals or before any other authorities in or before which he proposes to practise at a fee consistent with his standing at the bar and the nature of the case special circumstances may justify his refusal to accept a particular brief
3583470 it shall be the duty of an advocate fearlessly to uphold the interests of his client by all fair and honourable means without regard to any unpleasant consequences to himself or any other he shall defend a person accused of a crime regardless of his personal opinion as to the guilt of the accused bearing in mind that his loyalty is to the law which requires that no man should be convicted without adequate evidence
3583471 professional associations of lawyers have a vital role to play in upholding professional standards and ethics providing legal services to all in need of them and cooperating with governmental and other institutions in furthering the ends of justice and public interest
3583472 in my opinion the choice could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain whos had experience been tested in war and tried in peace another candidate who has not mr
3583473 between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not between one candidate whos a talker and the other candidate whos the leader america needs as our next president

3583661 your discretionary release at this time would thus not be compatible with the welfare of society at large and would tend to deprecate the seriousness of the instant offense and undermine respect for the law
3583662 avesthagen ltd is proposing subject to receipt of requisite approvals market conditions and other considerations a public issue of its equity shares and to file a draft red herring prospectus with sebi
3583663 the agreement aims to strengthen research in bio nutrition and will open up new avenues for research on traditional indian medicinal plants
3583664 while icmr has established linkages with the private sector under the framework of public private partnerships the mou with avesthagen ltd is the first of its kind in the research area of traditional indian medicinal plants
3583665 we at avesthagen have been investing and developing various tools and methodologies for the identification and validation of plant bio actives these efforts would be of use in both therapy and preventive healthcare avesthagens association with icmr will hasten this process and provide an independent view of our results
3583666 im tense about it because ill be lying awake worrying about it all night
3583667 el torito concepcion will defend his newly won title against mexican warrior jorge arce in mexico city on september 15
3583668 it is the eve of mexico s independence day and a major celebration the concepcion arce fight will be a highlight of this years fiesta
3583669 this is a great opportunity to beat a great fighter like arce and ill be in a better position among the best ranked 115 pounders in the world
3583670 both fighters dont give an inch and this fight will come down to who possesses the most determination and desire
3583671 concepcion was very well prepared and high on confidence after his last win arce is a very tough opponent to take on in our first defense but it shows the confidence we have in rafael and the confidence he has in himself
3583672 the move from first to second generation biofuels will be the difference between an eight track tape and an ipod
3583673 these results mark a cornerstone in the development of euv lithography they represent the first real 22 nm resist data building confidence for euv as a viable technology for 22 nm half pitch lithography
3583674 partnering with resist suppliers to accelerate resist cycles of learning has been critical to bringing euv resist readiness to this point where euv resists can now support 22 nm half pitch imaging the combination of sematech and resist supplier expertise has been an indispensable asset in conducting this important advanced research
3583675 this achievement was deemed to be impossible by leading resist experts only a few years ago resist suppliers have made excellent progress in improving euv resist resolution thanks to access to the mets which provide the highest resolution available worldwide among euv optical imaging systems
3583676 the focus of sematechs euv resist development program is to engineer current car platforms to realize 22 nm high pitch introduction and provide a fundamental understanding of euv resist exposure mechanisms to develop new platforms
3583677 we believe this two pronged approach will drive resist development to the highest level and support euvl introduction
3583678 there has been no major change between the previous agreement and definitive agreement signed on monday last on 14 july we had signed a term sheet where the final details needed to be worked out because at that point of time it was only in principle agreed that 80 million will be invested into the company now the only difference is that now in place of 80 million we will get 100 million w l ross will have 80 million and there will be issuance of 20 million of warrants
3583679 always keep everything on a ups and dont be lazy
3583680 violent crimes in the area are down eleven percent property crimes have decreased nine percent and more importantly
3583681 obviously there are always going to be those folks who feel they shouldnt have to pay for anything and are going to oppose everything
3583682 i dont see that much congestion on it i dont see it being a big problem i go through there constantly i dont see a big problem with congestion
3583683 our focus on revenue growth properly building the companys infrastructure and rounding out our leadership team remained our top priority this quarter
3583684 we are not pleased with the ebitda results for the quarter however we are in the process of addressing this issue on several fronts and we will align the operating expenses as required on our path to profitability strong performance with our large pharmaceutical customers combined with our initial success in globally expanding our distribution resources are our plans to deliver top line results that will support our growth initiatives
3583685 our ebitda for the second quarter was below our expectations the loss in the quarter was driven by a decline in our gross margins and an increase in operating expenses the decline in margins was associated with sales of our lab units which were introduced in the previous quarter at lower margins and higher sales of the custom production machines we have put corrective plans in place to address the margin decline that should bring our margins back in line with historical levels results were also adversely affected by an increase in operating expenses associated with building our leadership team and making investments in our future growth
3583686 collaboration with besang on 3d ic development demonstrates the expert technical capability of nnfc and the commercialization of emerging semiconductor technologies we expect that besangs breakthrough 3d ic technology will provide ultimate low cost and high performance solutions for the semiconductor industry
3583687 i am pleased that besangs 3d ic development is the first success story of excellent collaboration and technology exchange between snf and nnfc
3583688 one of unique features of besangs 3d ic is the capability of unrestricted 3d interconnections using conventional via technologies that does not require wafer alignment nor through silicon vias for 3d interconnects
3583689 conventional cmos technology is facing its scaling limits therefore this emerging 3d ic technology will extend the lifespan of cmos technology because it is an excellent alternative way to accommodate more devices on a given wafer area
3583690 besangs 3d ic is a novel combination of short process steps formation of array blocks in 3d thin layer transfer using unique wafer bonding followed by low temperature processing
3583691 hence there is a high possibility for this breakthrough 3d ic to provide low cost manufacturing solutions for the semiconductor industry besangs 3d ic is a very attractive technology and one wonders why other companies have not thought about it however i always believe in the dynamics of small companies as my colleague dawon kahng and i worked as a small team within a large organization when we co invented the non volatile memory in 1967 at bell labs
3583692 we can imagine evolution of semiconductor technologies through 3d vertical stacking instead of conventional horizontal shrinking which is getting more expensive and facing ever more technical difficulties
3583693 for rapid wafer processing engineers at nnfc and students and staff members at snf reserved the tools for besang with such strong support from nnfc and snf besang has successfully reached this level of technology development in a very short time i would like to say special thanks to all at nnfc and snf
3583694 they have a better quality of life and they are happier all the time
3583695 we have also decided to cut the premium on the floor price for e auctions to zero from five per cent

3583697 i take every race seriously its good for me to get out early and talk to people about the issues i worked on its a great vote of support going into the general election
3583698 im very thankful that the voters have chosen to put their faith in me again if this holds true
3583699 its clear my issues of smart growth versus uncontrolled growth and reining in the influences has resonated with the voters
3583700 the west coast has really gone off on the hops
3583701 were a little bit more toward an english style we try to cover the range of beers as a brewery you try to cover the range as much as you can
3583702 the steelheads run by us three or four times a year good fishing
3583703 its a really good style its an in between style its certainly not a stout its dark but its light feeling its not heavy like a stout it has a smoky character but not too much
3583704 you cant see through it thats really well balanced its not too roasty not too chalky
3583705 it has a very strong malt character and hop balance
3583706 the malts make it more palatable too you dont burn your palate on the hops the alcohol is pretty well masked which makes it very drinkable
3583707 the red is a good malty red but we use west coast hops so it has that american feel to it
3583708 it has a very nice aroma with the caramel malts
3583709 the citrus hops work very well with a very heavy malt background
3583710 there are so many beers out there everybody is looking for something special and unique it makes it very much worthwhile we work really hard here
3583711 theres nothing like an election to refocus your attention on your constituents so i am very grateful of course to the people who took the time to vote today
3583712 wir hatten das gef hl dass bald jemand den jackpot gewinnen w rde
3583713 those who worked collaboratively with the mayors office to arrive at balanced budget could expect to have their priorities honored
3583714 its a very aggressive and obviously retaliatory move but were not just going to roll over
3583715 imagine youre a working person and all of a sudden your salary gets slashed people can lose their homes just because the mayor wants to retaliate it remains to be seen how well fight back but were certainly not going to watch our members lose their homes
3583716 the financing which was carried out at the prevailing market price for discovery metals shares provides a solid financial platform for the company as it progresses with its bankable feasibility study on the boseto copper project in north west botswana
3583717 this is an excellent result for the company and i am extremely pleased with the continued support of the company from a number of existing major shareholders in botswana and australia
3583718 the funds raised will enable the company to rapidly progress the bankable feasibility study on the boseto copper project it is our plan to bring the project into production as soon as possible

3583740 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3583741 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3583742 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3583743 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3583744 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3583745 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated

3583768 las feministas promovieron la igualdad con los hombres en materia de carrera profesional y fomentaron la experimentaci n sexual en vez de alentar a comprometerse joven y ser fiel a consecuencia de todo eso las mujeres tienen menos hijos y m s tarde y muchas no tienen ninguno
3583769 ni las clases de estudios sobre la mujer ni las comentaristas feministas les avisaron que la fertilidad alcanza su m ximo en torno a los 25 a os ni que los embarazos a edad tard a entra an m s riesgo ni que los abortos provocados aumentan la probabilidad de partos prematuros en embarazos posteriores

3583773 la misandria en el derecho de familia es fruto de una ideolog a que considera a los ni os como propiedad de las mujeres pese a que muchos estudios muestran que los ni os quieren y necesitan a sus dos progenitores y ni uno solo permite concluir que sea beneficioso para el ni o estar a cargo de la madre sola

3583778 cautious to want republicans to start trying to appeal to identity groups like this because it dilutes or negates the basic conservative message
3583779 what i am about to opine on comes from a combination of life experience being raised by korean immigrants my limited experience of dealing with asian communities around the nation and maybe some bald assertions about what asian americans care about
3583780 this is a divide that goes deeper than economics into the way people perceive the world americans usually see individuals chinese and other asians see contexts americans are more likely to see categories asians are more likely to see relationship
3583781 the individualistic countries tend to put rights and privacy first people in these societies tend to overvalue their own skills and overestimate their own importance to any group effort people in collective societies tend to value harmony and duty they tend to underestimate their own skills and are more self effacing when describing their contributions to group efforts
3583782 the ideal of a harmonious collective may turn out to be as attractive as the ideal of the american dream
3583783 throughout history no tyrant ever rose to power except on the claim of representing the common good
3583784 coming from nations where democratic engagement has been actively discouraged or eliminated where politics has wrecked furtunes and ruined families many asian american voters remain reluctant to get involved
3583785 the central political debate of the 20th century was over the role of government the right stood for individual freedom while the left stood for extending the role of the state

3583788 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3583789 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3583790 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3583791 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3583792 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3583793 partisan liberal democrats should have good reasons to fear the candidacy of ltc allen west
3583794 if klein is sending a signal for someone to give an ultimatum to a campaign volunteer for west does it not follow that he is somewhat concerned about the republican challenger
3583795 congress should immediately discontinue the practice of earmarks to restore fiscal responsibility to an out of control congress congress should remove unrelated projects from appropriations bills we need strong leaders in congress to stand up to speaker pelosi and do what is right for the american people
3583796 because of allen west this 34 year voting dem is changing parties and going west republican party needs to get this man and his message out front at the convention he will turn heads change minds and inspire legions of voters to vote mccain

3583823 so i want to add that i am a friendly and polite person
3583824 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3583825 part of it is political parties are a distant analog to families and you really hate to step outside a family environment
3583826 while john mccain has spent his career putting the country first ahead of personal and party interests sen obamas record is a lesson in partisanship
3583827 for me the national interest comes before party concerns particularly internationally
3583828 we do need a new direction in american policy and obama has a sense of that
3583829 he recognizes that a long term occupation of iraq is not only expensive its extremely dangerous to the american interests
3583830 he also recognizes that its preferable to speak with potential adversaries rather than simply shun them
3583831 theres a distinction between trumpeting issues and realistically looking at effectiveness
3583832 i have never known a time period where the american brand has been in less repair
3583833 if you ask americans of any political persuasion conservative liberal or moderate whether theyd rather see us lead the world with allies or alone most people instinctively say were better off with allies
3583834 the public does understand that something is not right about our policies today

3583839 but but id love them unconditionally if they wanted to id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
3583840 kevin is all for everything he wants her to have 50 50 custody he wants them to raise these kids together kevins heart is right
3583841 its wonderful the relationship is new for both of us she sometimes calls me 50 times a day and asks me things that light my life up but like all daughters she is very manipulative and cunning so she gets what she wants a lot

3583847 when i get retained to try a case in say los angeles i think the calculus is different than it was eight years ago
3583848 i think there is less trepidation when hiring a person of color to be the first chair at the counsels table in a place where theres likely to be a majority white jury

3583850 here i am a patriot who i can honestly say harbors no anger or racial animosity toward anybody
3583851 from what i know about barack obama that he feels the same in his heart and soul
3583852 i was in the camp of the believing that he was the t shirt of the week
3583853 felt both candidates were eminently well qualified to be president of the united states and the real question was which candidate was best positioned to prevail in the fall
3583854 theres a swing in mood from supply concerns to falling demand particularly in the united states but attention is beginning to turn to europe and asian economies as well
3583855 all in all we are maintaining a bearish trading posture in quest of additional price weakness to the 108 area a level that appears achievable by weeks end
3583856 this is in the national interest it is the image of our national music national culture especially the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important extremely serious matter
3583857 we made the decision that the voice we would use was yang peiyis the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3583858 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in the aspect of voice yang peiyi is flawless
3583859 we had been through several inspections they were all very strict when we rehearsed at the spot there were spectators from various divisions especially a leader from the politburo who gave us his opinion it must change
3583860 i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi that is to say we have a perfect voice and a perfect image and representation in our teams view combined together
3583861 adults may lie but leave the kids out of it
3583862 what makes a man a man a friend of mine once wondered
3583863 recognize that i have neither the trust confidence or respect of the mayor nor the superintendent my instinctive reaction to this realization has been to soldier on but i have too much respect for myself my family the school the students the faculty and the staff to continue
3583864 the already difficult and challenging job of being the high school principal becomes next to impossible
3583865 its a loss for the community i think joe was an excellent principal my only concern is that people will remember only this most recent episode
3583866 was foggy in his memory of how he heard about the information
3583867 monotheists i e muslims who yearn to support the prophet
3583868 delivering easy to use assessment products that predict success on the job
3583869 he confessed to 1 000 burglaries and i have been able to find 180 victims so far
3583870 he said he did it for the adrenaline rush for the challenge
3583871 but but id love them unconditionally if they wanted to id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
3583872 kevin is all for everything he wants her to have 50 50 custody he wants them to raise these kids together kevins heart is right
3583873 its wonderful the relationship is new for both of us she sometimes calls me 50 times a day and asks me things that light my life up but like all daughters she is very manipulative and cunning so she gets what she wants a lot
3583874 if you spend more money than you make you know what happens
3583875 a couple of divorces thrown in a few things like that
3583876 alleged mata hari of al qaeda could provide treasure trove of intelligence
3583877 her education troubled us we know that shes extremely bright shes radicalized we knew that she had been planning or at least involved in the planning of a wide variety of different operations whether they involved weapons of mass destruction or research into chemical or biological weapons whether it was a possible attempt on the life of the president
3583878 we knew that she was involved with a great deal and we had to bring her into custody
3583879 what she described as units and what we would call cells
3583880 she was hanging inside the house with steven and with kelly klein nearly the entire time nobody could go inside the house they had security blocking the way it was so rude
3583881 it was a black party everybody had to wear black
3583882 kevin had a bonfire off to the side but there were no lights whatsoever and his backyard is huge he has these black benches all around and people kept crashing into them
3583883 they put my name up all over their ads like im in love with them and i really dont like them
3583884 we are just recently very recently engaged so we are just taking it easy i mean im 23 there is no reason to rush into it
3583885 when attacks hit a peak in 2000 at that time somalia was just a blip on the radar screen
3583886 then it becomes a big problem piracy tends to be a feature of areas where there is either lawlessness or real economic deprivation and its very difficult to eradicate
3583887 piracy and armed robbery at sea in a manner consistent with international law
3583888 nearly all our notions of their behavior come from the golden age of fictional piracy which reached its zenith in 1881 with the appearance of robert louis stevensons treasure island

3583892 piracy is still troubling the shipping industry report industry fears revival of attacks though current situation has improved
3583893 this is no time for politics at all the americans are hurting regardless of the party they belong to
3583894 i would agree with the gang of ten or the mccain plan which would not drill in anwr but everything else would be good
3583895 first and foremost we should be drilling more of americas resources theres no reason not to be drilling in alaska theres no reason not to be exploring in the off shore areas of the united states
3583896 theres no reason technically or environmentally that we cant be entirely responsible and entirely careful and environmentally friendly with the resources we have and still explore americas resources
3583897 what were trying to do is educate the public of what an arterial street really is and why we really need arterial streets
3583898 i think the important thing is is to avoid using taxpayer money to promote the raising of taxes this is not appropriate
3583899 i think it is weve done it for snow removal and everything else to show people i think its valuable to show people that
3583900 if we had passed a sales tax yes then its appropriate to explain that i dont think its appropriate for the city before weve even had a vote out there talking about a sales tax increase because there are many people on the council who do not want to raise the sales tax
3583901 its been a rollercoaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident
3583902 you play for pressure you play to have all the games count
3583903 ever since i was a little boy i wanted to be in the world series that hasnt happened to me yet when i go to boston i feel like theres a legitimate chance for that to happen this year
3583904 im not lucid right now im saying funny things give me a half hour and ill talk
3583905 i was shocked because i figured after i cleared waivers a couple weeks ago nobody wanted me
3583906 its going to take some adjustments i was throwing my blue indians socks in a box and a guy said they wear red socks over there
3583907 this trade is more about clearing room to give some of our other players an opportunity giving paul a chance with a contender and providing us some payroll relief
3583908 it just seemed like the right time to add this kind of stabilizer
3583909 you never want to get caught short on starting pitching in august and september because theres very little you can do about it
3583910 was an opportunity without dipping into our farm system to add a veteran starter we can trust
3583911 everything has been done out in the open i have a reputation i do not want the fans of cleveland or honest caring people to think that i cheated
3583912 i wasnt a red sox fan this offseason put it that way
3583913 it will take a quick adjustment but im eager to play for terry francona and with a talented team with a chance to win it all
3583914 i think that dr brodie just did south dakota a favor by saving this piece of history but it can be history for not only those who have already been here but those who choose to have their weddings here as well
3583915 we can do christmas parties family reunions corporate meetings pretty much anything you can think of out here we have a lot of different rooms that can accommodate different group sizes so thats extremely nice that we can do something for as little as 10 people to up to 400 people
3583916 its only about 66 years old but all of the history thats taken place within this home all of the visiting dignitaries both national and international its one of south dakotas most historic homes and its very important to save that for future generations of south dakotans because when you have this structure all the history thats taken place within the walls you cant get the same feeling if the house is in a landfill
3583917 were collecting artwork by south dakota artists were collecting governor memorabilia political memorabilia from all of the gubernatorial campaigns weve already been able to collect several of the campaign buttons and the inaugural buttons but were always looking for things that evoke south dakotas history
3583918 people may not view it as historically important today but in another generation or so in another hundred years people will be very pleased that the mansion was saved and renovated and saved for the people of south dakota
3583919 iemand zei eens tegen me dat de grootsheid van een sporter wordt bepaald door de mate waarin anderen naar je kijken ik zie het als een compliment mijn advies is breek alle records ook de mijne
3583920 i think we should limit ourselves to what we can enforce unless we are willing to create an office within the sheriffs office that is willing to enforce every aspect in the order
3583921 no less jingoistic than those who have never gone abroad
3583922 a significant proportion of them believe that using force to promote chinas national interests is acceptable

3583930 the west coast has really gone off on the hops
3583931 were a little bit more toward an english style we try to cover the range of beers as a brewery you try to cover the range as much as you can
3583932 the steelheads run by us three or four times a year good fishing
3583933 its a really good style its an in between style its certainly not a stout its dark but its light feeling its not heavy like a stout it has a smoky character but not too much
3583934 you cant see through it thats really well balanced its not too roasty not too chalky
3583935 it has a very strong malt character and hop balance
3583936 the malts make it more palatable too you dont burn your palate on the hops the alcohol is pretty well masked which makes it very drinkable
3583937 the red is a good malty red but we use west coast hops so it has that american feel to it
3583938 it has a very nice aroma with the caramel malts
3583939 the citrus hops work very well with a very heavy malt background
3583940 there are so many beers out there everybody is looking for something special and unique it makes it very much worthwhile we work really hard here

3583943 so i said well wed better get him out here
3583944 i was sitting there when manny was forced at the plate and then i realized that i didnt shake mannys hand for getting the hit so he went by me and i put my fist out
3583945 he was probably 8 feet away and he put his fist out and was starting to come back
3583946 and he thought i meant go inside and well pick you up in the ninth
3583947 all the guys said hey we play nine in here
3583948 as far as swinging a club thats not going to happen until next year i just dont have a choice

3583950 i dont know what the doctors are going to tell me about playing golf down the road im taking it day to day week to week all im doing every day is looking forward to my next day

3583953 australians dont have much respect for the music press it runs counter to their culture
3583954 the idea of anyone actually daring to criticise musicians for the sound they make is almost heresy
3583955 the idea of anyone actually daring to criticise musicians for the sound they make is almost heresy

3583967 we are not happy with the way the united states has been behaving especially the way the united states has been propping up mr saakashvili over the past few years

3583993 there are any number of opportunities for russia to reverse course and to demonstrate that it is trying to behave according to 21st century principles
3583994 but i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3583995 directives on the use of the name of god in the sacred liturgy
3583996 some impact on the use of particular pieces of liturgical music in our country as well as in the composition of variable texts such as the general intercessions for the celebration of the mass and the other sacraments
3583997 ask them to try to come up with alternate language
3583998 it may take time for people to get used to singing something different
3583999 an opportunity to offer catechesis for the faithful as an encouragement to show reverence for the name of god in daily life emphasizing the power of language as an act of devotion and worship
3584000 by directive of the holy father in accord with the congregation for the doctrine of the faith this congregation deems it convenient to communicate to the bishops conferences as regards the translation and the pronunciation in a liturgical setting of the divine name signified in the sacred tetragrammaton
3584001 as an expression of the infinite greatness and majesty of god it was held to be unpronounceable and hence was replaced during the reading of sacred scripture by means of the use of an alternate name adonai which means lord
3584002 avoiding pronouncing the tetragrammaton of the name of god on the part of the church has therefore its own grounds
3584003 apart from a motive of a purely philological order there is also that of remaining faithful to the churchs tradition from the beginning that the sacred tetragrammaton was never pronounced in the christian context nor translated into any of the languages into which the bible was translated
3584004 it is not business as usual anymore with the russians and there are consequences for doing what they are doing

3584036 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored

3584052 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever

3584054 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
3584055 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
3584056 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine

3584058 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
3584059 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant

3584077 as a warm july rain falls on a patchwork of small holdings half a days walk from the nearest road the women harvest yams the men plow behind sturdy oxen and fat chickens goats and cows roam outside mud houses and yet for all the apparent abundance this area is so short of food that many are dying from starvation
3584078 hunger has swept east africa this year spurred by poor rains and rising food prices the u n estimates that 14 million people urgently need food aid including 2 6 million in somalia and more than 1 million in kenya in ethiopia 4 6 million people are at risk and 75 000 children have severe acute malnutrition
3584079 nearly a quarter century ago an outright famine led to live aid an international fund raising effort promoted by rock stars which produced an outpouring of global generosity millions of tons of food flooded into the country yet ironically that very generosity may have contributed to todays crisis
3584080 then came the double blow of drought and soaring food prices of the 7 3 million 5 4 million suddenly needed extra food aid the sobering lesson even the best efforts to eliminate hunger are expensive slow and uncertain of success depressing as it may be this may not be the last time ethiopia needs help

3584115 passengers talking to drivers made shorter utterances had more frequent pauses and were more likely to be talking about the upcoming hazard than cellphone conversors drivers and their cellphone conversors tended to make longer utterances than the other participants were less likely to mention the hazards had the poorest recall of the hazards and had the highest crash rate
3584116 recalls variously the invasion of afghanistan the invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 and even the soviet invasion of georgia in 1922
3584117 this kind of brutal attack has happened before against georgia and against other countries that the russians want to dominate
3584118 russia has the right to intervene anywhere in the former soviet union
3584119 probably the best relations that have been there for quite some time
3584120 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3584121 they of course had to hang saddam hussein for destroying several shiite villages
3584122 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way

3584124 the child we put on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression lin miaoke is excellent but in terms of voice all of our team thought yang peiyi was flawless the most outstanding
3584125 when we rehearsed on site there were people from various groups especially a leader from the politburo who when listening to lins voice gave us his opinion it must be changed so we changed it
3584126 fear of having an imperfect performance or something that does not look exactly right
3584127 the girl who was rejected has seen the media praise the other girls star like singing
3584128 both will feel hurt and offended and a lot of people will feel they have been misled all round
3584129 when i told her it was not her voice she breathed out heavily and then said no more about it
3584130 i was worried about her reaction but now i am relieved she is a very calm tolerant and brave girl
3584131 its fascinating as they used to keep things covered up for years
3584132 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt and whose background you are beginning to wonder about she has brought real results and even his words today are in doubt invented for a campaign ultimately he cannot win against john mccain
3584133 must now in earnest show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3584134 does anyone believe it is possible to win the nomination without over these two months raising all these issues against him
3584135 a nice campaign that wins the states alone that can be won will that be enough or do serious issues have to raised about him
3584136 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3584137 we are never going to say anything about his background we have to show the value of ours when it comes to making decisions understanding the needs of most americans the invisible americans
3584138 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt

3584141 the immediate and unconditional cessation of hostilities and the complete withdrawal of russian and georgian forces to their positions prior to august 7
3584142 to take further action as appropriate to help bring about and implement a peaceful and durable solution to the crisis
3584143 we have not received a clear answer today to that question
3584144 why start a second front from abkhazia why attack the rest of georgia and why attack the infrastructure of georgia why threaten to attack the civilian airport of tbilisi
3584145 its been a rollercoaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident
3584146 you play for pressure you play to have all the games count
3584147 ever since i was a little boy i wanted to be in the world series that hasnt happened to me yet when i go to boston i feel like theres a legitimate chance for that to happen this year
3584148 im not lucid right now im saying funny things give me a half hour and ill talk
3584149 i was shocked because i figured after i cleared waivers a couple weeks ago nobody wanted me
3584150 its going to take some adjustments i was throwing my blue indians socks in a box and a guy said they wear red socks over there
3584151 this trade is more about clearing room to give some of our other players an opportunity giving paul a chance with a contender and providing us some payroll relief
3584152 it just seemed like the right time to add this kind of stabilizer
3584153 you never want to get caught short on starting pitching in august and september because theres very little you can do about it
3584154 was an opportunity without dipping into our farm system to add a veteran starter we can trust
3584155 everything has been done out in the open i have a reputation i do not want the fans of cleveland or honest caring people to think that i cheated
3584156 i wasnt a red sox fan this offseason put it that way
3584157 it will take a quick adjustment but im eager to play for terry francona and with a talented team with a chance to win it all
3584158 too many corporations are using tax trickery to send their profits overseas and avoid paying their fair share in the united states

3584160 kevin is all for everything he wants her to have 50 50 custody he wants them to raise these kids together kevins heart is right
3584161 its wonderful the relationship is new for both of us she sometimes calls me 50 times a day and asks me things that light my life up but like all daughters she is very manipulative and cunning so she gets what she wants a lot

3584167 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3584168 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3584169 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3584170 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3584171 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3584198 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3584199 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3584200 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3584201 any policy like tarpley suggests will be hijacked by the elites
3584202 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3584203 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3584220 in the event of a major catastrophe whether it be local or global
3584221 countries who made a deposit will be able to make a withdrawal like a bank to grow any crops they may have lost due to any disaster
3584222 this system forgets that farmers are the worlds original and ongoing plant breeders grains asia programme officer shalini bhutani who is based in new delhi told ips
3584223 the ultimate beneficiaries will thus be the very same corporations that are at the roots of crop diversity destruction says a grain publication but cary fowler head of the global crop diversity trust gcdt in charge of the gsv says such criticism seriously misrepresents the purpose and workings of the svalbard global seed vault and portrays the gcdt in an inaccurate misleading and unflattering manner
3584224 the seed vault has been welcomed by over 165 countries and the food and agricultural organisations fao s commission on genetic resources and it is already being used by developed and developing countries and by ngo seed savers though not by corporations
3584225 it is already a decade since the unced in rio de janeiro and the convention on biological diversity cbd realised that gene banks had their own limitations starting from major power breakdowns to excluding farmers access to these banks to realising that seeds conserved under freeze conditions did not evolve when grown under changed environmental conditions
3584226 it is a sad commentary on the science behind the assumption that the worlds food is secure inside a freezer she said
3584227 this reinforced the fact that in situ conservation of germplasm was not only the food security of millions of the worlds population but also identified as imperative to food sovereignty
3584228 global seed wealth can survive only in the farms and homes of global rural communities the gsv takes away these seeds from the farmer and breaks the first link in the food chain
3584229 this vault is more the need of the life sciences industry known for its pirating of farmers material and traditional knowledge said grains bhutani

3584284 while there is still a decided preference for senator obama the more conservative element of the christian population is slowly coming to grips with what an obama presidency might be like
3584285 as the finer points of a wide range of issues are clarified by each nominee the initial excitement about senator obama has lost some luster to an increasing number of people whose vote is influenced by their spiritual perspectives if sen mccain converts such apprehensions into votes this will be a closer race than many have anticipated
3584286 the mccain campaign can not be satisfied with thinking evangelicals and conservative faith voters will vote for mccain as long as they thoroughly demonize obama
3584287 evangelical leaders and grassroots activists continue to tell the brody file that mccain needs to start incorporating faith and values talk into his speeches and town halls

3584292 weve got more violence and now we dont know who to talk to about it
3584293 we are deeply concerned because it leaves the radical extremist outfits free to do what they like not merely on the pakistan afghanistan border but clearly our side of the border too
3584294 its not like theres suddenly going to be a war between the two countries
3584295 in the absence of greater trust you will see a kind of pincer movement against pakistan by afghanistan and india and pakistans establishment and state turning toward whatever tools it has at its disposal to defend itself
3584296 we made more progress in terms of peace than we have in the past 60 years

3584303 as i arrived in grand rapids what struck me was the fantastic combination of charm and choice how can a meeting planner not fall in love with the citys beautiful ambiance and the choices for conducting meetings the more you see the more you want to see
3584304 grand rapids has a defined excellence not found in many other places i was impressed by both the city and the welcoming community of people i met i thoroughly enjoyed my visit

3584307 its not a question of people who are already overweight becoming clumsy because the majority of these children werent any heavier than their peers

3584324 the most characteristic genre according to von rad that lies historically at the foundation and theologically at the heart of the ot is that of testimony von rad understands the ot as the testimony of the people of israel to gods actions in human history the ot is not just a document that records what ancient israelites believed and how these beliefs changed over time it is the sediment of conscious theological work aimed at future generations of readers
3584325 von rad defines testimony as the dynamic interplay between israels memory and the expectation of a god who is revealed in the history of the chosen people
3584326 in its two operational modes memory and expectation testimony is that form in which according to von rad all the different traditions of the ot find their common denominator

3584332 sadly mrs nicholls was seriously ill and the independent experts view was that she was unlikely to survive due to an overwhelming infection of her kidneys
3584333 should not be surprised at the nationalism of kashmiris there has been a facade of normalcy in kashmir tourists coming and mobile phones arriving do not mean that people are not angry
3584334 wasted chances to come up with a creative solution with pakistan and kashmiris
3584335 i think the blockade made people realise that kashmir at the moment totally depends on india and that we need to be economically independent
3584336 the excessive and unwarranted use of force against the people of indian occupied kashmir
3584337 these statements constitute clear interference in the internal affairs of an integral part of india such statements by leaders of a foreign country do not help the situation nor do they contribute to creating the atmosphere necessary for the dialogue process between india and pakistan to move forward
3584338 the first thing is the whole event is very undesirable in terms of both the domestic situation and its linkage with the larger bilateral peace process
3584339 i see this will have a bad impact and considering that pakistan is going through a bad turmoil now the overall impact on the peace process will not be very positive
3584340 it was a satellite glitch i dont have any more information than that immediate
3584341 as a result this division is behind last year and we are currently re organising the business to counter the changing business conditions
3584342 the main reason for this is reduced volume due mainly to significant summer frosts especially in the hawkes bay region
3584343 while we ultimately believe the investments will contribute adequate returns we have a substantial amount of work ahead of us to turn these businesses around and make them profitable
3584344 at this time of year it is difficult to predict the year end result with certainty
3584345 the new zealand domestic economy has slowed and this is reflected in the food purchasing behaviour of the nation with consumers buying less high value fresh food lines

3584355 no one can be complacent in this competition at any time i think this years air nz cup will be the closest we have seen
3584356 its going to be pretty close who would have ever thought there would only two unbeaten teams wellington and bay of plenty after two rounds
3584357 maybe us beating manawatu will be the upset this week in some peoples minds
3584358 weve been so keen that its looked as if weve tried to score from every opportunity
3584359 there is plenty of ambition but there are times when we need to slow it down and be more patient
3584360 telstras turnaround continues to gain momentum on all fronts with our fiscal year guidance met or exceeded for the third consecutive year
3584361 we dont really want to give any info on how we use it as an investigative tool to help the bad guys
3584362 it is an investigative tool for us and it is a very new investigative tool
3584363 ive seen them in cases from new york city to small towns whoever can afford to get the equipment and plant it on a car
3584364 and of course its easy to do you can sneak up on a car and plant it at any time
3584365 but i dont think thats something detectives would be too happy to put out there like that
3584366 they do have different techniques they like to use on suspects but they dont really want people to know
3584367 although i seem to tolerate introspection better the older i am there are still too many claims on my attention to permit more than the briefest excursions down the path of self awareness when i am no longer busy with politics and with my own ambitions i hope to have more time to examine what i have done and failed to do with my career and why
3584368 its his voice but im going inside his head to speak some psychological truth about him
3584369 no one is closer to mccain than salter who has been with him since 1989

3584375 you have to talk to people and educate people to expand the possibilities in this field
3584376 you need to go into larger trials for safety and efficacy insmeds limited data appeared to be good data however bioequivalence testing in healthy volunteers does not provide the necessary data on how the biologic actually works in the body which can only be determined through more extensive clinical testing in patients where safety and efficacy are evaluated

3584382 with that much market power we need to make sure consumers are the winners and not just the company
3584383 the ntias apparent lack of planning is a serious oversight one that they must correct promptly and without dipping into the funds marked to help consumers purchase converter boxes
3584384 the program has been very successful we anticipated coupons would be recycled and prepared for it
3584385 weve seen a lot of instances where a company will be working on a product thats not even released yet and the diagrams for that product are already out on the net
3584386 this case is unique because of the high profile of the targets the individuals on this list are at a very high risk almost imminent of identity theft
3584387 i didnt even know what peer to peer was i do now
3584388 this may explain why two weeks ago i got a 9 000 cellphone bill from at amp t
3584389 the way that mikheil saakashvili has approached this has been by thinking that he could be an extension of the west a partner of the united states
3584390 in many ways we have given him cause for thinking that with the many visits to the united states the talk of georgia as a beacon for democracy
3584391 the man in the iron mask shys to the corner like a scolded child he looks for direction from anyone on stage his presence is not one of confidence no boldness found from a vet like doom its not him cant be why wont he address the crowd

3584394 were trying desperately to set up it systems that alert us to critical things like addresses phone numbers names that sound similar
3584395 weve been testing it we just havent got it fully implemented yet
3584396 if this person de la torre was following safety regulations we would not have these people dead today its a travesty
3584397 i think we need to give this individual a full opportunity to be heard but if hes guilty of what we suspect he needs to feel the weight of the penalty

3584401 we were not exactly a juggernaut we didnt score a lot of runs yet we won 94 games and a big part of it was bobby because he was always available
3584402 he kept you on the edge of your seat at times he wasnt automatic
3584403 he had almost a whirling dervish delivery kind of like rodriguez legs and arms flying but he was a big strong horse
3584404 it takes a solid pen to help you get to that number
3584405 the stark truth the most overrated and underrated players in baseball history
3584406 the siouxsie and the banshees of relievers because this guy is one of baseballs epic one hit wonders yes thigpens 57 save season still stood as the all time single season record last time anybody checked but surrounding that season heres what youll find no other 35 save seasons a 3 43 career era an opponent batting average of 252 and a blown save for every four he converted
3584407 he happened to hit terry in the head and it caused a melee
3584408 bobby was in the middle of the scuffle and was down on the ground and when it was cleared i remember saying to him are you all right i think he hurt his back he continued to pitch but he wasnt quite the same after that his command was off and the ball didnt seem to have quite as much pop
3584409 i felt like i was ready to get back into professional ball
3584410 ive been trying to get back with the white sox in some capacity for the last couple of years i just wanted to get back into baseball and do something
3584411 the international baseball federation has confirmed the test it was done outside the olympic period starting on july 27

3584415 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
3584416 its true there are work opportunities in yemen but not at the level i needed after i got married and not to the level of ambitions that i had in my future
3584417 we of course have to prepare our sentence recommendation consistent with what the jury found
3584418 history and world opinion will judge whether the government proved the system to be fair
3584419 the problem is the law was specifically written after the fact to target mr hamdan
3584420 no authority barring them from disclosing such information in civil discovery proceedings
3584421 people recognize that what videos you watch is deeply private information that can tell a lot about you
3584422 even if they uploaded pirated clips were not going to use the data to find them were not going to use it to sue them were not going to use it to look at who they are
3584423 today we carry out congresss unambiguous mandate to protect consumer privacy
3584424 fcc commissioners regularly champion consumer choice transparency of information and competition on a level playing field but this decision creates less of each
3584425 after todays ruling verizon will have additional incentive to focus on making sure that all its customers are happy with their service rather than reserving the red carpet treatment for those who have already decided to leave but whose transfer has not yet been technically implemented
3584426 i am therefore disappointed that the commission would prohibit these practices which promote and benefit consumers and particularly disappointed that they would do so and prohibit practices from only one class of companies
3584427 moreover the cable companies engage in such practices to keep their video customers from switching to other providers
3584428 being in this area has made me a lot more politically in tune with whats going on
3584429 bush was a good man and had good morals i felt he was the better man
3584430 as i have indicated before this is an unusual situation
3584431 i am recommending that with the voluntary commitments sirius and xm have offered on balance this transaction would be in the public interest
3584432 that kind of information as well as everything else on my office computer e mails memos correspondence district case work was open to outside eyes
3584433 the internet can be used as a terror weapon it can be used as a disinformation apparatus
3584434 and nobody has done that more expertly than the chinese government
3584435 the ip address in a specific country explains nothing in this high tech area its so easy for those guys to make up ip addresses
3584436 my governments position on cyberspace hacking activities is consistent and clear we are against such activities
3584437 i just discovered that im impelled to get out there and get the truth of the matter
3584438 when youre in the bubble you cover every story the same way
3584439 at off the bus because theyre not part of the professional gaggle they can come up with their own views of whats happening which may be different from what the conventional wisdom is saying
3584440 i believe the citizens of liberty will see the totality of all three of the measures and how they will benefit from the combination of the three
3584441 it has that berm in the middle where the light rail can go it wont take as much of the portion that cars travel on either
3584442 it would have slowed down traffic too because people wouldnt have been able to make turns
3584443 i think its really a part of that whole story of the big family of kansas city kansas public schools
3584444 its a little part of that of how we support each other no matter what happens
3584445 i had two surgeries and both days she was in the waiting room with my mom and dad and rich
3584446 i just cant say enough about just how wonderful it was you know and she gave me the hats and she was there and she let me cry
3584447 we try to help work as a family to help anybody in trouble
3584448 i had to leave my sunglasses on the whole walk
3584449 i was crying so hard because in front of me were people just like me in pink shirts
3584450 thats why we do it thats why we do it
3584451 and it just does so much good because were all benefiting from the research
3584452 the floors are shiny and the walls are painted like we would always do in the summer
3584453 we do have some maintenance things were trying to get done before the first day
3584454 he has no idea whats going on between his wife and his son
3584455 he doesnt even hold the cowbell right what an asshole
3584456 we met in a friendship circle we struck up a conversation and we kept writing after that
3584457 i guess it was just love at first sight he was so nice to everybody i knew he was somebody i wanted to spend my life with
3584458 when i was little he would beat me all the time but by the time i got to high school i was beating him all the time
3584459 i would often play doubles with him and his friends it was something special we shared
3584460 it was a great time to relax and enjoy each other
3584461 ive been to over 80 concerts and the majority of them were with him
3584462 he shared with me my favorite band dave matthews band and he belonged to their fan club winning front row tickets last year
3584463 he was a very loving person and he would do anything for his family
3584464 he would love to be remembered as a big sports fan and as a man who loved his family
3584465 i still think the commission could act by the end of the second quarter
3584466 we are concerned that this merger could possibly undermine competition and harm the consumer if certain conditions are not applied
3584467 the issue has been highlighted in the context of the wireless industry but what id also point out is that this is a practice that seems to be migrating to other platforms
3584468 to the extent that the commission takes action and says that these kinds of practices are reasonable and these are not that could have implications for other industries
3584469 this is less about the revenues the carriers will lose because of the fee issue and more about the lawsuits and how this will lessen the lock that carriers have on customers
3584470 are critical to keeping wireless rates affordable and in these economic times that becomes even more critical
3584471 in addition physical security at multiple locations did not sufficiently protect critical control systems
3584472 as a result systems that operate tvas critical infrastructures are at increased risk of unauthorized modification or disruption by both internal and external threats

3584477 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
3584478 excessive use of force by indian security forces against the kashmiri people and called for an immediate end to violence in jammu and kashmir
3584479 security forces and policemen are guarding the streets and a curfew has been imposed in the entire valley
3584480 the army has been called out and they are patrolling the streets
3584481 fruits are getting rotten as people in jammu are blocking our trucks
3584482 from children to old men all are suffering for the past one month
3584483 there is no reason for an agitation on this issue
3584484 we will not leave any stone unturned to resolve the issue
3584485 an all party delegation has appealed to all the sections of people in kashmir to maintain peace and harmony
3584486 these statements constitute clear interference in the internal affairs of an integral part of india
3584487 such statements by leaders of a foreign country do not help the situation
3584488 nor do they contribute to creating the atmosphere necessary for the dialogue between india and pakistan to move forward
3584489 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
3584490 if our convoy is halted there will be trouble kashmiri public opinion is in favour of crossing this bloody line
3584491 however a decision in the matter can be taken only through mutual arrangements between india and pakistan
3584492 this is not protest against land transfer in fact this is anger against india
3584493 i see this will have a bad impact and considering that pakistan is going through a bad turmoil now the overall impact on the peace process will not be very positive
3584494 such statements by leaders of a foreign country do not help the situation nor do they contribute to creating the atmosphere necessary for the dialogue process between india and pakistan to move forward
3584495 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
3584496 the sass patronised by rss and bajrang dal is trying to give shape to the long cherished concealed agenda of the sangh parivar to divide the state on regional and religious lines
3584497 let me make it clear to sass leaders they should not try to browbeat the kashmiri politicians as such idiotic actions could cause more harm to the people of jammu than any other region
3584498 credible inputs that thousands of sangh parivar activists from gujarat up mp and maharashtra have infiltrated into jammu and it is they who are planning and spearheading the protests there
3584499 those opposed to the amarnath land transfer were questioning jammu and kashmirs status as an integral part of the country
3584500 jammu and kashmir is an integral part of india whoever raises questions on this issue will have to pay for it
3584501 this is not a question of amarnath or a shrine alone they are saying it is okay that you have alloted land for vaishno devi in jammu but how can you allot land in kashmir
3584502 shyama prasad mookerjee during his struggle 55 years ago for cancelling the visa system for those visiting the state had promised people that he would either get the permit system abolished or sacrifice his life we seem to have turned a full circle today
3584503 every indian has the right on every inch of land and that no one could question allotment of land for amarnath pilgrims in the valley
3584504 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
3584505 it took diane pickel plappert six months to tell a counselor that she had been raped while on duty in iraq while time passed the former navy nurse disconnected from her children and her life slowly unraveled carolyn schapper says she was harassed in iraq by a fellow army national guard soldier to the extent that she began changing clothes in the shower for fear hed barge into her room unannounced as he already had on several occasions
3584506 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
3584507 from the administration and the police to the judiciary and the private sector the invisible hands of prejudice economic and educational inequality seem to have frozen the quota for muslims at 3 5
3584508 for virtually every socio economic marker of well being the muslim is well below the national norm not to speak of the level commensurate with her or his share of the national population and the evidence suggests these inequalities are not decreasing over time
3584509 the reported exclusion of muslims from raw isnt a surprise
3584510 it is an extension of the systematic discrimination that muslims in india encounter whether it is in education jobs or accessing bank credit
3584511 how can they be trusted to represent and protect indias national interests when they are pro pakistan or when their loyalty to the community of muslims the world over is greater than that to the country
3584512 they might be in a better position to understand the muslim mind and in gathering and interpreting intelligence from muslim countries
3584513 since there is a possibility that such a decision could go horribly wrong nobody wants to take the risk
3584514 i didnt want to pick him up because his diaper was a little wet so i gave him to my mom
3584515 it seemed like the baby was out there for a while because he was really really thirsty
3584516 when i called my parents and said we found a baby they were like a baby what usually im bringing home snakes and rabbits
3584517 if we wouldnt have been outside we probably wouldnt have heard him screaming and something could have happened to him
3584518 this bill will provide an important alternative to the way doctors currently get their information about drugs from the drug companies themselves this practice seems to be fraught with conflicts of interest
3584519 by providing physicians with thorough independent research on all the drugs available to them we believe we can improve the quality of health care and reduce the cost of prescription drugs in america

3584600 oh yeah let me tell you watch out for that cat shes a crafty one shes
3584601 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
3584602 arrow 3 system an advanced model of an arrow interception missile would help israel intercept ballistic missiles in a much wider range than the current model
3584603 israel objected to the development of the sm 3 at the expense of the us funding of the new arrow program as the defense ministry prefers to provide work to israeli industries and because the cost of the new standard is estimated at 10 12 million per missile while the arrow 3 will only cost 1 5 2 million per unit
3584604 the program will be under american supervision and should it turn out that the development is being delayed or is failing to reach its objectives the resources will be shifted to the development of the sm 3
3584605 being number one in big brother is not always the best thing
3584606 i know and love the velvet revolver guys but there is no truth to the story about me joining their band
3584607 are you really going to ask for a recount over one delegate
3584608 i dont like going on if i dont feel like i have new information or an interesting way to present the information
3584609 now i can take the minutiae and make it sound like english for laypeople who havent been following the dnc delegate rules for 20 years
3584610 the secret to his success is he understands politics and can explain it
3584611 our platforms are 24 7 and someone has to man the platforms
3584612 i think he has emerged as one of the most clear eyed honest dealing pundits in the media
3584613 i have nothing but respect for all of the balls he juggles all day
3584614 weve never looked at how all the unique things this government wages against others could be used to inform our defensive posture
3584615 we really need to move from the reality that the advantage is always with the attacker to how we can have our offense better inform our defense to shrink that gap
3584616 this an important and perhaps one of the most important national security and economic security issues facing us today
3584617 we want a broader information flow to the private sector of the threats were seeing so that they can increase their security posture as well
3584618 this is the oldest conflict in security because if we give away our best exploits we lose the ability to use them offensively
3584619 thats a conflict the guys at nsa deal with every day when you find good ones how long do you wait before you tell the vendors and people defending our own networks
3584620 we lost a key exploit for a critical hard target so there was a gain and there was a loss
3584621 many of us agree that were going to have to accept a lot more intelligence losses in order to increase the defensive posture of the nation
3584622 to my mind one of the key tests of whether this program will be successful or not is how much information falls on the classified side of the line and how much falls on the unclassified side
3584623 the more information that gets classified the less likely the initiative will succeed
3584624 what youre seeing here is the acknowledgment by the administration that dhs had its chance flubbed it and now weve got to get serious
3584625 basketball is for elites after all real americans and real american presidents play golf
3584626 belum ada kepastian indikasi untuk menyiarkan memang ada tapi kami masih belum bisa memastikan yang pasti untuk tahun 2009 kami akan mencoba mendapatkan hak siarnya
3584627 foi uma partida muito dif cil o corinthians n o est na lideran a por acaso por isso importante somar pontos para se classificar para a s rie a acredito que estamos no caminho
3584628 acho que apresentamos um futebol consciente vejo o empate como um importante resultado
3584629 tivemos bons momentos durante a partida assim como o corinthians acredito que o resultado foi justo por outro lado nos distanciamos dos advers rios mais pr ximos isso muito importante
3584630 goggles saya terisi air selama berenang saya ingin memecahkan rekor dunia saya ingin mencatat waktu 1 menit 51 detik atau lebih baik tapi keadaannya tidaklah terlalu buruk
3584631 you can learn something from every dancer that means both the good and not so good ones
3584632 the fbi wants to have a well thought out planned life cycle management system for its infrastructure and the technology refresh program is the contract to facilitate that
3584633 the contract mostly covers core it systems but we think this will evolve in the future to include a lot more specialized programs
3584634 they left it open so it does not rigidly require just one kind of pc
3584635 it is great to see the fbi taking this step it is really important
3584636 things are not as they should be at the epa
3584637 scientific findings are being suppressed and distorted 889 scientists personally experienced at least one type of political interference scientists are being pressured by outside interests
3584638 the work we do here at epa is work we are all very passionate about
3584639 when there are difficult policy decisions not all the time does that line up with where our passions have directed us sometimes we disagree but the scientists at epa are the best in the world and their work will continue to be a valued part of any regulatory action we take
3584640 these survey results suggest a pattern of ignoring and manipulating science in epas decision making
3584641 the internet connects people all over the world in a manner and scope of ease that is impossible if it were not online
3584642 organizations like the christian coalition should use the internet to communicate with our members and worldwide audience without snooping or blocking or slowing down
3584643 we felt issues specific to us were well covered at the first hearing and the focus of this event should be broader than any individual companys issues
3584644 the fcc is trying to figure out what are the broader implications of this issue a lot of which doesnt even fall under the jurisdiction of the agency
3584645 if they believe the platform will be controlled tomorrow there will be less investment today
3584646 its always a good show and its good to keep my hand in
3584647 they frequently leave their rear ends hanging right out and if you do manage to get around them most of the time you can see they had plenty of room to get in
3584648 its important that you dont have people crossing the centre line trying to go around buses
3584649 we are in constant discussion with local transport authorities on this issue
3584650 the longer buses tend to be used on the major routes where we typically have longer stops anyway
3584651 if there are any problem areas we would look at those on a case by case basis
3584652 i have huge respect for elliot and work well with him
3584653 facebook is a tremendous organization and i would not leave it if it were not for a great opportunity
3584654 the kids knew what the old building looked like and to be able to walk in and see all of our new bright colors is really exciting to see that in their faces
3584655 its definitely going to make us closer together not have to travel so far to get to our special classes like art and music
3584656 its also going to help us feel more like a complete school a complete family
3584657 without that revenue from the penny we would not be able to do what were doing to the extent of seeing a number of buildings either being built or renovated
3584658 the poster child for everything thats wrong with animal testing
3584659 its shocking to look back and see how little we have accomplished
3584660 have significantly reduced the number of animals required for safety assessments and provided for improved welfare of animals used in safety evaluations
3584661 i support the concept of a public private partnership for very practical reasons
3584662 if done correctly the private sector will help provide a world class interoperable public safety network
3584663 we often act as if we can manipulate god into doing what we want him to do by saying the right words or making promises or having sufficient faith but god teaches us through prayer that he doesnt do anything to suit us in prayer and through prayer we change to fit into gods will whenever we can say yes to god we will never be hurt he is a god of love and you should never put limitations on him it is only in our resistance and pulling away and saying no to god that we get hurt
3584664 hij heeft heel goed gezwommen we hebben natuurlijk in aanloop naar het toernooi al geroepen dat pieter beter dan ooit was maar dat moet je ook laten zien maar goed we moeten niet vergeten dat dit pas de halve finale was vandaag zwom pieter zijn beste race ooit maar in de finale moet het n g beter
3584665 vanaf de kant gezien was dit n van zijn beste races ooit deze kwam bij zijn gouden race van sydney in 2000 in de buurt ik ga nu samen met de race analisten zoeken waar nog rek in zit een tijd rond de 47 00 gaat niet lukken maar misschien is dat niet nodig in een finale hoeft niet altijd de snelste tijd genoteerd te worden
3584666 not to belabor the points amy and i have made recently about the south florida housing market and property taxes but it just so happens there was another article on the subject today that kind of backs up our argument that the problem is that the market is overpriced not that taxes are too high
3584667 recent legal developments may aid in the fight against modern day slavery in florida
3584668 this weekend the florida democratic executive committee was scheduled to meet in tampa and one of the items on the agenda happens to be one of their most important duties as a committee electing the 27 presidential electors who would possibly vote in the electoral college should rather when barack obama carry the sunshine state it didnt happen or for that matter anything else because the committee failed to get a quorum together to conduct business
3584669 harry sargeant iii the republican party of florida finance chairman and part owner of a boca raton based oil trading firm has been credited with collecting more than 500 000 for mccain but about 50 000 of those contributions reportedly were solicited by mustafa abu nabaa sargeants jordanian business partner at international oil trading co
3584670 grendel came into my life about ten years ago she had been adopted from the pound by my girlfriend they all moved in around the corner from us and lived together three or four years grendel wold roam the neighborhood visiting different dogs and people from house to house she was a frequent visitor to our home where her face would suddenly appear at our back door she got along with our miniature dachshund nicki and tolerated georgie the cat when her parents broke up and were not in a position to take care of her any longer it was only natural that regina and i would adopt her
3584671 myriam marques the heralds clunky replacement for ana menendez finds herself wrapped in a dilemma over wet dry foot not that she would realize it she has been demonstrating a knack for stating the obvious while making it sound as if theres an actual point being formulated this time she rages against the symptom without looking at the cause
3584672 what do mark foley john walsh and orrin hatch have in common
3584673 there seems to be evidence that the georgian military not only had united states training but possibly u s mercenaries participated in the attack florida resident joe mestasl who was visiting ossetia when the attack occurred had these comments

3584675 after straw polls on thursday and friday i would be entirely justified to be discouraged in our fight to unseat adam putnam and to return true representation to floridas 12th district despite these lopsided defeats i know there are some qualifiers to be taken into account
3584676 if attacked by shark or moray eel hold stick vertically and insert into animals mouth to prevent closing of jaw if the animal should bite you insert stick in animals eye and push do not bleed this will only excite the shark or eel

3584691 my most immediate task is to get us in the right financial position to take advantage of the sales pipeline and opportunities ahead
3584692 with strong support from key existing shareholders we believe we are close to securing the additional financing that will provide identiphi the capital for longer term stability and put us on the road toward profitability
3584693 since coming on board ive spent time speaking with identiphi employees and partners analyzing identiphis technology and market position and performing a critical review of our sales opportunities what i see is a company with a dedicated team and the right ingredients which i believe is poised for strong growth under experienced leadership we have innovative biometric and security solutions strong relationships with our customers and partners and most importantly a solid pipeline of sales opportunities as a veteran and active participant in the industry both internationally and in the us i have seen first hand how the interest in biometrics and authentication solutions is increasing globally i do believe however that the biometric industry is still an emerging market that has proven to be unpredictable and dynamic but i feel my experience will help us take advantage of the best opportunities for success and growth

3584705 this means that creative individuals remain in contact with the extra information constantly streaming in from the environment
3584706 the normal person classifies an object and then forgets about it even though that object is much more complex and interesting than he or she thinks the creative person by contrast is always open to new possibilities
3584707 if you are open to new information new ideas you better be able to intelligently and carefully edit and choose if you have 50 ideas only two or three are likely to be good you have to be able to discriminate or youll get swamped
3584708 scientists have wondered for a long time why madness and creativity seem linked
3584709 it appears likely that low levels of latent inhibition and exceptional flexibility in thought might predispose to mental illness under some conditions and to creative accomplishment under others
3584710 we are very excited by the results of these studies
3584711 it appears that we have not only identified one of the biological bases of creativity but have moved towards cracking an age old mystery the relationship between genius madness and the doors of perception
3584712 we highly value our relationship with ms knowles it is categorically untrue that loreal paris altered ms knowles features or skin

3584715 when we get to michigan ill be a lot happier when we dont have to qualify on time
3584716 right now im a little disappointed because i wanted that top 10 and to finish off strong but 11th ill take it
3584717 were in the top 35 and thats been our big deal
3584718 and i know once we get in were not going to fall back out the car was good jimmy like usual used awesome strategy
3584719 it was a decent day although i would have liked to have finished top 15 the guys did a great job improving this car from where it was in practice yesterday all their hard work paid off it definitely felt like a different car im looking forward to returning to michigan next week
3584720 jimmy elledge crew chief has done a great job just coming over here and all the additions that jay frye general manager has added to the team we have been running well and we just needed some luck on our side and some good strategy jimmy has brought that along even at pocono we wanted a better run than 19th but we did a good job to get that out of it all we have to do is keep continuing now that were in the top 35 and no reason to fall out
3584721 there are so many benefits this project could have in that neck of the woods
3584722 we have scoured san antonio for three years for an appropriate project that has all of the right attributes for a successful urban infill community the lone star presented a very unique opportunity in this regard
3584723 the thing about the lone star site thats so phenomenal is its size
3584724 its extraordinarily difficult to acquire a tract that large if you have a 23 acre site you can do much more
3584725 if this is done right this could be every bit of a 200 million to 250 million project
3584726 given the progressive developments that are happening all over southtown and king william it could be absolutely wonderful
3584727 but its a huge project having worked on a 3 acre project it boggles my mind to execute something that huge
3584728 my group has developed over 4 000 units and we specialize in adaptive reuse
3584729 we believe that san antonio is one of the more dynamic and healthy real estate markets in the u s and we are happy to bring our adaptive reuse and green building experience to the downtown urban core particularly on the southern reach of the river walk
3584730 i think san antonio and bexar county have demonstrated their commitment to the river and its improvement
3584731 pedro gonzalez got terminated and she received no discipline at all
3584732 ten members of the jury agreeing was the minimum necessary
3584733 we believe we did not discriminate against mr gonzalez because of gender we further believe there were questions posed at the end of the case that may have confused the jury an appeal is likely
3584734 he was looking for a service manual on his computer when he saw a document or file with his name on it
3584735 he suspected his supervisor was looking to get rid of him so he opened the document and printed it out

3584737 i dont know about you all but cash and i have been glued to the olympics
3584738 how amazing was the opening ceremony i still dont know how they coordinated 2008 people to move in perfect sync
3584739 we went down there thinking that the time trials would be straight up like theyve been in the past for the north south
3584740 they decided to change it to group qualifying drivers time trialed only against the 15 16 rivals in their respective groups once we got there and i dont agree with that ive never been a fan of group qualifying because its too much luck of the draw so if i knew thats what they were gonna do i wouldnt even have gone down
3584741 we were 17 th fastest overall 17 962 seconds which wouldve put us on the pole for a heat race if it was a straight up format instead we started sixth in a saturday night heat because we were in the fastest group
3584742 if theyre gonna do things the way they did them this year
3584743 then that was my last time there for that race
3584744 i prefer to talk about the great things in san antonio
3584745 weve got a lot of great things to talk about this is not great this is bad forty percent of the people who live in bexar county do not have a high school diploma
3584746 really one of the most important subjects we have which is educating our children really hard to top that one

3584799 we were pretty good right off the truck but fought a tight race car most of the practice
3584800 the crew worked hard and made the right adjustments to free me up we made a mock qualifying run at the end of the practice and shot up the leader board
3584801 we had a fast car in practice and qualifying and i felt very optimistic going into this race we were having a decent run when it felt like i started losing the brakes i was trying to be patient and wait for a caution but at that point i heard a pop and the right front let go this is unfortunate for my team the rab racing guys give me such a strong car every weekend and i really thought we were going to be able to have a decent run
3584802 with a recent drop in points i realize that every point counts
3584803 although i have no prior experience on dirt i hope to capitalize on my short track racing experience and have a good points day for the rab racing team

3584820 my concern is that individuals who are of normal weight and in good physical condition may neglect coming in and having their practitioners evaluate them for those risk factors
3584821 it is quite clear that you cannot judge someones health or sickness simply by looking at them

3584827 se desconoce que todo lo actuado contra el terrorismo durante la d cada del 70 del siglo pasado se dio en el marco de un conflicto armado no internacional sujeto por lo tanto al derecho de guerra y no al c digo penal ordinario que rige durante la paz

3584838 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3584839 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3584840 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3584841 in the whole scheme of things 0 2 percent is good
3584842 when you look at those other markets theyve kind of gotten hit twice
3584843 part of the equation in missouri is weve only had to deal with one big challenge the economy
3584844 the securities brokerage business increasingly demands size and scale and hrbfa simply did not have the size to be able to compete at the highest levels in the future this transaction will give the hrbfa financial advisors a dynamic parent company with a growing platform so that they can compete effectively and efficiently at the same time the transaction will benefit block shareholders as we reduce risk in a noncore area and enhance our returns on capital when this transaction closes we will have completed the strategic realignment that we promised shareholders and our efforts will be tightly focused on our tax services business that serves more than 23 million clients

3584847 i think that for most people if they could buy the box they would
3584848 since the class can only rent the cable box directly from time warner manufacturers of cable boxes are foreclosed from renting and or selling cable boxes directly to members of the class at a lower cost
3584849 obviously people have the right to make claims through the legal process and well certainly review it and respond accordingly
3584850 for instance diagrams of cable hookup found at time warners web site focus on the existence of a cable box with no mention of possible use of cablecard
3584851 elsewhere on the web site time warner tells its customers there are limitations to a cablecard connection
3584852 i think its very similar to the cases brought back in those days where slowly but surely the courts whittled away at that kind of protectionist activity by at amp t
3584853 i think the same thing is present here you have a lot of companies out there manufacturing these boxes and theres nothing necessarily proprietary about them they only cost about 30 or 40 at most and theyre charging around 15 a month for them
3584854 some of the big bellwether financial services companies are precipitating the correction that were seeing

3584858 the securities brokerage business increasingly demands size and scale and block financial advisors simply did not have the size to be able to compete at the highest levels in the future
3584859 when this transaction closes we will have completed the strategic realignment that we promised shareholders

3584861 this transaction will bring together two strong organizations with very similar cultures and client value propositions

3584871 i think we were fifth quick after the first lap of qualifying i went into turn two and the thing just snapped on me it hit on the driver side and i think i might have broke my foot i am not sure yet we got the car fixed and we started at the rear and i think by lap two we picked up about 11 spots i knew we had a good car at that point
3584872 on the last restart i think we blistered both rear tires and i think thats what hurt us brian campbell race winner was strong and i definitely wouldnt have got around him in the closing laps
3584873 this is our second straight top three finish in this challenge division
3584874 after qualifying i was like oh no not again but we battled through it and we have good momentum heading into milwaukee thats probably our best racetrack

3584892 one of the last things you would expect to slow

3584986 the team owner is located in mooresville north carolina he contacted me in december about the race
3584987 i didnt know anything about off road racing but he asked me if i would like to drive and of course i said yes i couldnt believe this opportunity had just popped up out of the blue we just went from there to talk about everything from the race event to the truck and what is involved in running in this type of race
3584988 one of my co drivers is jessica brannam a go kart racer from illinois
3584989 the other is my brother and charlie daniels racing teammate cliff daniels originally it was supposed to be someone else but when she backed out it gave cliff the opportunity to drive he had already agreed to be my navigator so it worked out great for both of us we work together at the track already so we will not have to worry about miscommunication during the race there are a lot of segments where he is either navigating for me or i am navigating for him and we should be able to utilize our teamwork to our benefit through those sections
3584990 this race is definitely different for me but i do not hardly know enough about it to be worried
3584991 i am looking for this event to be a great opportunity to make contacts meet new people learn a new style of racing and have some fun
3584992 all of the drivers entered in the event will be there about a day and a half before the race so i definitely plan on talking to a lot of other drivers once i get there and asking them questions
3584993 it is going to take all day and possibly a large part of the night to cross the desert so it will definitely test our endurance this truck has only been raced once before in the baja 1000 score race and this is a totally unfamiliar type of racing in an unfamiliar vehicle for us but we all feel that if we can finish we will do pretty well we are mainly looking to enjoy the challenge gain some off road experience and finish the race

3585087 theres a lot of evidence that the more patients are required to pay more for their care the more that they make economic decisions about what to get or what not
3585088 while some of that may be perfectly reasonable and acceptable what i worry about is people not getting care that is really essential for their health
3585089 yes we know when people have comprehensive health insurance they have a tendency to overuse and access that care more than they absolutely need
3585090 a little bit of discipline may be all right but i would want to err on the side of making sure they can get sufficient care
3585091 we know from past economic downturns that employers and individuals tighten their budgets as a whole but they certainly tighten their health budgets
3585092 the conduct then was in the defendants scope of employment regardless of whether it was unlawful or contrary to the national security of the united states

3585100 esse resultado se deve basicamente ao aumento do volume de vendas e ao controle do custeio que foi menor do que o do primeiro semestre de 2006 mesmo com a infla o de 11
3585101 foram vendidos em m dia mais de 3 bilh es de litros de derivados do petr leo e de etanol neste primeiro semestre

3585103 o consumo de etanol cresceu 58 no primeiro semestre do ano contra 9 de crescimento do diesel
3585104 i was taunted about my weight by pupils and a teacher as the bullying got worse i hid away at home i was afraid to go out anywhere
3585105 by the age of 16 i felt totally worthless and had no self esteem or confidence id only go out to visit family friends in their own homes
3585106 the last straw was when i reached over 20 stone i went to my favourite store to buy clothes and couldnt find anything to fit
3585107 i knew i had to do something to change my life
3585108 i think they are more concerned about the health of their kids family and themselves i think they are a little bit more cautious in thinking if i can reduce the potential for feeding the kids stuff that may or may not have pesticides on it thats hopefully a good thing
3585109 when i was going into turn 3 i thought i got it like im finally going to win this race or a race
3585110 and all of a sudden im coming out of turn 4 and the car just coughed my reaction at that time it was like no but i need to still finish the race i didnt want the car to stop right away i didnt know how many cars were behind dixon and marco andretti i just wanted to finish the race as high as i could
3585111 obviously with a 78 point lead now i think its pretty healthy but anything can happen
3585112 helio could quite easily have gained on us and made it more of a fight
3585113 with sonoma and chicago and belle isle tracks that those guys are very good at as well we are going to make sure we dont lose too many points but it would be nice to gain a couple on helio in sonoma and maybe we only need 82 points or something to have it sewn up heading to chicagoland speedway on sept 7 that would be nice but in reality i think well be racing almost till the last race
3585114 this win means a hell of a lot after the streak ive just had which i dont really feel was much but its great to be back in the top three in the championship i really hope i can hang on to that
3585115 i knew it was going to be hard to pass on this track i knew there was a chance at getting pole winner raphael matos at the start and luckily i pulled that off and was able to hang on
3585116 i still had to fight off some really strong competition luckily we were strong enough to hang on to the lead
3585117 it feels good to make up some ground in the standings after the last few races
3585118 we still have three races to make up points we are due for a strong showing on a road course and after that is another oval so i feel good about our chances to make up some points
3585119 its coming right enough hitlers going to have czecho slovakia all right if he doesnt get it now hell go on and on till he does better let him have it at once we shall be ready by 1941
3585120 yes sure the united state is going to be fine

3585145 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points

3585147 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3585148 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3585161 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3585162 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3585236 kids are eating too much and too much of the wrong kinds of food and theyre not exercising and as a result of that were seeing health issues
3585237 serious health issues that certainly will compromise the quality of life for these young people or even shorten their lives

3585243 this is a major haul a major capture for the fbi
3585244 to find someone who has such rich information computer hard drives e mails that is really a major capture
3585245 her education troubled us we know that shes extremely bright shes radicalized we knew that she had been planning or at least involved in the planning of a wide variety of different operations whether they involved weapons of mass destruction or research into chemical or biological weapons whether it was a possible attempt on the life of the president
3585246 we knew that she was involved with a great deal and we had to bring her into custody
3585247 what she described as units and what we would call cells
3585248 were proud of our role as americas first line of defense against foreign animal diseases

3585251 the warrant officer saw and heard siddique fire at least two shots as interpreter 1 tried to wrestle the gun from her no one was hit the warrant officer heard siddique exclaim allah akbar another interpreter interpreter 2 heard siddique yell in english get the f out of here as she fired the rifle
3585252 her medical condition is that she was shot in the abdomen there are stitches that run from the breast plate area down to the belly button area layers and layers of tissue have been sewn sutured we have heard reports that she has lost a kidney we dont know if those are accurate but we are concerned about that there has been intestinal damage part of the intestines we understand have been removed
3585253 is fighting hard and remains in serious but stable condition
3585254 we were going to have a coffee maker we were going to have lawn chairs his car had tires we were going to shop for groceries he wore pants
3585255 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3585256 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3585257 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3585258 the seemingly incongruous but highly effective pairing of carters rough abrasive voice and strident guitar and andrew broughs saccharine sweet vocals and pop hooks
3585259 with its edgy lead vocal from carter was underpinned with a dynamic jagged guitar and stabs of strings which tumbled into a churning melodic chorus on which broughs voice soared

3585269 the danger of beating the system is that it puts you on death row
3585270 she nearly lost her own life and that of her baby through delay and perhaps even the transfusion
3585271 although the patients previous record indicated that he had undergone previous surgery there were no scars to prove it
3585272 the blood group of the sample taken from the patient did not match the group in the records from previous admissions this was identified before any incorrect group blood was given
3585273 the result was a delay in transfusion and the patients life was placed at a significant and unnecessary risk
3585274 whats happening is that they are non residents trying to capitalise on the system here because there is no facility for non residents and they have to pay
3585275 it is dangerous and we would like people to stop doing it
3585276 very vigilant about who is eligible and who is not

3585281 watson look up at the sky and tell me what you see
3585282 astronomically speaking it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets astrologically it tells me that saturn is in leo timewise it appears to be approximately a quarter past three theologically its evident the lord is all powerful and we are small and insignificant meteorologically it seems we will have a beautiful day tomorrow what does it tell you
3585283 thats it ill never make varsity now my baseball playing life is over
3585284 theyre sending you a message you and your 80 mph fastball are not varsity material theres no point in playing anymore the dream is dead just walk away
3585285 dont you get it brett the packers are sending you a message youre no longer the guy they want to lead their team

3585289 im proud of all of you dont forget to study you also have to graduate dont forget that okay
3585290 most importantly look forward to this season enjoy every single game every single game every single moment
3585291 roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3585292 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and his values
3585293 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt
3585294 make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to our backgrounds
3585295 she focused primarily on issues that mattered to working families this was a strategy that was not employed discussed by senior staff or even pushed by mark penn
3585296 even if you concluded it would be a useful line of attack some of us were queasy about it
3585297 its fair to say that most people thought it would really rebound on her
3585298 the middle of america to the middle class in the middle of the last century
3585299 many people believe under the surface that 20 years sitting there with goddamn america would make obama unelectable by itself
3585300 what does that say about his leadership that he never left or complained
3585301 we are in for a real fight but assuming she at least achieves the projections for tuesday and given some breaks it is a fight that she can win
3585302 eventually we will like to see overseas contribution surpassing the domestic share but that will take a long time
3585303 while the business model is different the academic mould is the same with the same quality assurance
3585304 we do notusually set up campuses instead we provide intellectualresources learning and teaching systems assessments marketing and networking
3585305 by then the campuses at the fraser technology park in kuala lumpur and subang will be able to accommodate about 15 000 students
3585306 we will soon be offering masters in economic crime management a diversified source of revenue will ensure that we get a stable income
3585307 we want to extract returns from the existing products to fully exploitthe strength in the existing markets while innovating new products
3585308 given the lack of new incentives and newregulations to spur the industry we are unlikely to see any major upward movement in the unit prices of the reits and their values will continue to be depressed in tandem with the current market condition
3585309 while the returns are basically good if compared to the returns from the market the current structure governing reit investment has hardly changed since its inception in 2005 as the successor to the old property trust
3585310 the incentives tax structure and rules have to be revised hopefully in the coming budget 2009 in orderfor the reit industry in malaysia to flourish
3585311 thanks just got back from a dinner meeting will look at this
3585312 thanks just got back from a dinner meeting will look at this
3585313 there is nothing more fulfilling than unconditional love of self and when we experience it we can extend that love to every aspect of creation when we love ourselves unconditionally all fear disappears and we experience union with everything this isnt a subtle experience its absolute it is the greatest thing that can happen to any human
3585314 i am a normal modern woman i have gone through all the same dramas romantic disillusionments addictions and losses that we all experience yet through this system i have moved beyond my discontent and fears to find love and freedom i wake every morning full of joy for no apparent reason my happiness no longer depends on my surroundings my passion is to share this teaching with all of humanity
3585315 to me these animals represent the epitome of true power
3585316 myers had his people call the campaign to demand that the video be removed from youtube for copyright violation

3585319 im looking forward to showing the splendour of the fleurieu to the wider world
3585320 this is a big film by local standards but we have wonderful crew we have wonderful cast and all sorts of opportunities to exploit here in terms of locations
3585321 ive always loved filming here and ive always looked for opportunities to do it and at last that has happened
3585322 this investment will assist to reach our target to increase production in sa to six feature films per year by 2014
3585323 this will help south australias brand as the home of independent filmmaking
3585324 many challenges have begun to surface mainly the prospect of oversupply
3585325 there is a general consensus that certain sectors of the real estate market in dubai are currently being driven by speculation rather than market fundamentals
3585326 real estate isnt like the stock market only in dubai you see people flipping apartments to make fast money
3585327 thats the good thing about the olympics its been a lot of fun
3585328 the best part was having a photo taken with them
3585329 the crowds were a very international mix with people coming to china to cheer for competitors from around the world
3585330 here is a representation that should give you a rough idea of performance
3585331 it shouldnt be there but i think the important part of it is the principle is that people expect truth in advertising and particularly for political advertising
3585332 its untruthful to say that mark vaile is the member for lyne
3585333 come near to god and he will come near to you

3585345 the riverside county group cross was working for included numerous riverside county schools as well as the area ymca she wrote a federal grant application on their behalf that was for programs for school age children overseen by the indio youth task force
3585346 forgery is a crime that involves fraudulent intent to do something
3585347 she had no fraudulent intent to do something she had a positive intent to do something for a lot of kids
3585348 we have been totally transparent with the riverside district attorneys office and its chief investigating officer
3585349 i just wasted a whole evening cleaning up this guys social diaper explosion

3585355 it hurts really bad i did everything i could to get ready
3585356 i should have been defensive the last 10 seconds i left myself open and he attacked
3585357 i wasnt surprised by the first period weve been working on starting faster but after the second period we were right where we wanted to be
3585358 he made a small mistake but at the olympics you cant wrestle with a small mistake

3585360 awakening russian national self awareness has to a large extent been unable to free itself of great power thinking and of imperial delusions it has taken over from the communists the fraudulent and contrived notion of soviet patriotism
3585361 would not deliberately deceive a man whom he respected and with whom he had been in negotiation
3585362 historians will come to view august 8 2008 as a turning point no less significant than nov 9 1989 when the berlin wall fell
3585363 i looked the man in the eye i was able to get a sense of his soul
3585364 inconsistent with assurances we have received from russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo in south ossetia that existed before the fighting began on august the 6th
3585365 mr president did you hold off speaking out and acting because of these assurances
3585366 your reliance on russian promises would explain your inadequate response to a clear act of aggression
3585367 we had a very good dialogue i was able to get a sense of his soul
3585368 no we were doing some school and she sneezed and i looked and said what is that something was sticking out of her nose she said my gum and when i asked her why she put it in her nose she said because i was done with it then i asked her when she put it in her nose when i was in the corner
3585369 its hard for us to understand what the russian plan is
3585370 that support is aimed at encouraging the rise of georgia as an independent sovereign state
3585371 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3585372 lack of a neutral and effective peacekeeping force operating under an appropriate u n mandate

3585374 in our sport if you dont have your teammates you dont have anything
3585375 its not about who you know but who knows you
3585376 geographic reach has become a more important thing for us
3585377 cvs has always wanted to be in good markets that grow and if you look at population centers of the united states were in most of them this directly addresses the central and northern california markets and gives us access to those consumers
3585378 these are highly attractive regions of the country where we are not currently represented
3585379 and they are very difficult real estate markets to penetrate
3585380 given our changing industry landscape we believe this combination is the logical step for our company
3585381 it wasnt easy to come back after the blow of the 400 where i handled the race badly
3585382 the key this time was instinct my coach told me to follow my instincts and that was the best way for me
3585383 ive reached three great aims gold the world record and getting past the wall of 1 55
3585384 it was a satellite glitch i dont have any more information than that immediate
3585385 the result of the election could even turn on the decisions of the electoral court if there were litigation arising out of the results in certain critical seats
3585386 the most obvious example is tauranga if new zealand first gets three or four percent of the party vote nationwide but winston peters doesnt win back tauranga hed have all the incentive in the world to litigate the result
3585387 and if he were to get an election result overturned hed bring back a group of mps which would change the whole make up of parliament and potentially who forms the government
3585388 weve seen an increase in the number of people asking whether some action or statement they wish to make would be permitted or not under the efa
3585389 normally we would have seen the cv type brochure introducing the candidate from all the parties by now and we havent
3585390 i was looking to have an electorate office with the usual 2 4m x 1 2m sign
3585391 the electoral commission wrote to candidates saying that signs like that were a campaign expense and the commission assessed the value of standard sign at 6 per sqm which was over 17 a day
3585392 including construction and removal that came to about 4 600 for a four month campaign that was almost a quarter of the campaign allowance for just one sign
3585393 it didnt start there so its appropriate that it shouldnt be left there we shouldnt leave our rubbish lying around
3585394 short of dismantling it bit by bit i cant see any way of removing it its really wedged in there its been lifted and dumped on the rocks
3585395 as far as shifting it with bulldozers is concerned thats out of the question
3585396 our position on this matter will become clearer in the next week or so
3585397 wir wissen dass der erfolgreichste olympiateilnehmer aus den usa stammt und zehn goldmedaillen gewonnen
3585398 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3585399 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3585400 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3585401 while the riaa is busy changing its image to a snake eating its own tail one man is busy
3585402 but it is supposed to have hiss thats part of its character
3585403 theres a whole world of music that you dont hear anymore and its on 78 rpm records
3585404 the song is also a reflection of me as someone who does not take setbacks as the end all
3585405 the idea came from my heart and i hope it will inspire others to not see defeat failure and disappointment in life as something to wallow in but to use it as a lesson to do better in the future
3585406 my mum told me about the competition and insisted i go for the audition since this is my passion i didnt expect i was going to get through
3585407 now six months have passed and i have been doing this non stop
3585408 i dont sing in the shower and i dont actually enjoy going to karaoke lounges unlike many that i know

3585413 it gives me time to climatize and get used to the time change its pretty hot here like new orleans but there isnt as much air conditioning so it takes some getting used to
3585414 its really huge inside there im not used to competing before such a large crowd
3585415 i felt like he was close all along to committing
3585416 middle was throughout the process the lead horse people were trying to catch up to them they mtsu had been on him the longest and the hardest
3585417 mtsu coach kermit davis loves his intensity he told me he was watching him play a game at 8 in the morning and that there was gallman out there in a stance his hind end down at half court ready to play defense he said hes playing like its the state finals and its 8 in the morning
3585418 they watched him a lot this summer they havent offered him
3585419 one thing i like about coach pearl is that hes an up front guy i understand and i realize that hes going to be in on some of the best players in the nation i appreciated his honesty with me about where they stand with jalen
3585420 will they offer i dont know i know they like him
3585421 at 19 years 15 percent of runners had died compared with 34 percent of controls
3585422 both common sense and background science support the idea that there is nothing magical about running per se
3585423 it is the regular physical vigorous activity that is important
3585424 over time all groups decreased running activity but the runners groups continued to accumulate more minutes per week of vigorous activity of all kinds
3585425 members of the running groups had significantly lower mean disability levels at all time points
3585426 almost all of them did something else they continued their vigorous exercise
3585427 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names is a pretty amazing accomplishment

3585433 we were really excited to get on the field it has been a month since we were on the field and we have been biting at the bit and tired of practice
3585434 i am very pleased with what we accomplished today we came out swinging the bats well and got a strong pitching performance by jennie right now things are good but theres no time to celebrate

3585437 australia will protect its exposed business sectors and lower income households a lot more work has gone on about these and other issues than has been apparent from the new zealand government to date
3585438 the general tenor has been that 25 a tonne for carbon equals 4 cents a litre on petrol so why wouldnt you do that to save the planet theres a lot more to it than that as we have been pointing out but the public doesnt know or understand what it all means

3585441 what is more significant is what long term rules the sec plans to propose
3585442 would force firms to spend money to automate their systems and would add costs to both brokers and customers in the form of increased borrowers fees
3585443 in this time of economic uncertainty that would not be a popular outcome for wall street
3585444 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3585445 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3585446 our offense has to understand that we have to have tempo on a daily basis we cant just come out here we have some real good leaders we need some more of them hopefully well develop them as we get closer to game time
3585447 guys have to command a presence to play that position
3585448 we need more of them and were going to be demanding more of others
3585449 an innate sense of command a feel and presence all those things its like the supreme court said about obscenity im not sure how to define it i just know what it is when i see it its the same with quarterbacks
3585450 people often talk about this as the internet service revolution
3585451 that will eventually lead to machines that have lots of server capacity lots of low cost computing low cost storage and that will let us write software in an even more ambitious way eliminating the last constraints we have
3585452 the wall street journal recently did an article on failing etfs which hinted my view about them which is
3585453 no a trader is someone who makes a living trading ie needs to make money everyday and hence makes many trades daily
3585454 i guess im nosy do you care to share one such portfolio
3585455 i was not sure i wanted to order it unless it covered the tax aspects although am still mulling it over
3585456 etfs avoid irksome capital gain distributions through the clever use of exchanges in kind trades of mutual fund shares for securities in the fund with arbitrageurs because these trades are not taxable events etfs are typically able to rebalance their portfolios without realizing capital gains in effect etf shareholders are taxed as if the etf is just another security they pay taxes on dividends distributed by the fund but they are only hit with capital gain taxes when they sell their etf shares
3585457 the big advantage of etfs is that the sale of securities inside the fund does not typically generate taxable capital gains for etf shareholders investors in traditional open end funds must pay taxes each year on any net capital gains generated by trades inside the fund

3585462 in the week leading up to the issuance of the decree two other factors came into play one was a fear of violence that increasingly dominated government re action on 1 june 2008 a thug dominated muslim militia attacked a group of the decrees opponents sending twelve of them to the hospital and ten militia members to court
3585463 a religious sect may degenerate into a political faction in a part of the confederacy but the variety of sects dispersed over the entire face of it must secure the national councils against any danger from that source
3585464 i was taunted about my weight by pupils and a teacher as the bullying got worse i hid away at home i was afraid to go out anywhere
3585465 by the age of 16 i felt totally worthless and had no self esteem or confidence id only go out to visit family friends in their own homes
3585466 the last straw was when i reached over 20 stone i went to my favourite store to buy clothes and couldnt find anything to fit
3585467 i knew i had to do something to change my life
3585468 w e hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed
3585469 that whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness
3585470 prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are
3585471 and for the support of this declaration with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence we mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor

3585476 we express our deep gratitude to the united nations for the work it has done to help us recover and rebuild from war and build institutions of democracy we are committed to working constructively with the united nations as it continues its work in the period ahead
3585477 the constitution shall incorporate all relevant principles of the ahtisaari plan and be adopted through a democratic and deliberative process

3585483 x has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3585484 such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century xs government must respect ys territorial integrity and sovereignty
3585485 threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3585486 we are committed to working to ensure a peaceful and speedy resolution which maintains ys territorial and political integrity
3585487 hell you watch cnn surf the web and talk with people on the net all the damn time of course you can make good conversation

3585490 it was ricky who helped make history in the house of pain
3585491 personally i think ricky has proved himself as south africas leading scrumhalf is it fouries world cup status that now elevates him above ricky in my view fourie has done nothing to justify a place in the starting lineup
3585492 conrad jantjes is on present form the no 1 fullback it is worrying that people make decisions with their heart to give someone montgomery his 100 th test cap
3585493 this creates questions about where we are heading i know peter wants to win the tri nations but he must realise he will be measured according to his ability to transform the team and to make it representative of the countrys population for the 2011 world cup
3585494 we have also seen nothing of the new type of rugby that peter has spoken of
3585495 it is interesting that coloureds and blacks traditionally support the all blacks when they play at newlands
3585496 is the team that has been selected of such a nature that it will ensure the support of most south africans
3585497 we cannot repeat the cycle of the white era we must build for 2011 it is easy to fall into a comfort zone peter should be reminded of his mandate
3585498 its not all about transformation but it transformation is an important part of it not one black player has let south africa down this year
3585499 there must be a certain percentage of black players in the side
3585500 its not all about transformation but it transformation is an important part of it not one black player has let south africa down this year
3585501 wait whos that when did they turn against each other i thought those two were together

3585517 by no means are we giving up on clay buchholz far from it
3585518 but that said this move for byrd gives us the freedom to do the right thing in our rotation rather than forcing people into roles because of injuries well see how things shake out but by no means is clay buchholz out of our big picture

3585521 they have been attacking georgia from a cyber standpoint since july
3585522 our poor technician here has gotten three hours sleep in the past four days
3585523 the cyber attack was taking down every georgian government website
3585524 it is simply too early and we lack enough information to reach any conclusion as to the motive and identity of the attackers
3585525 these types of attack are only natural and happen immediately following any conflict or political tension
3585526 this actually looks more like grass roots hacktivist types people that jumped on the bandwagon
3585527 its like the olympics we are supposed to be above politics in the internet community

3585537 us forces in afghanistan face an unexpected enemy the language barrier they need villagers to cooperate but inaccurate translations keep defeating them here is one comically absurd example of failed communication
3585538 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
3585539 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
3585540 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
3585541 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
3585542 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
3585543 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
3585544 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
3585545 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
3585546 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
3585547 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
3585548 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
3585549 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
3585550 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
3585551 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
3585552 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
3585553 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
3585554 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
3585555 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
3585556 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
3585557 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
3585558 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
3585559 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
3585560 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
3585561 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
3585562 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
3585563 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
3585564 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
3585565 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
3585566 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
3585567 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
3585568 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
3585569 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
3585570 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
3585571 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
3585572 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
3585573 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
3585574 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
3585575 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
3585576 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
3585577 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
3585578 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
3585579 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
3585580 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
3585581 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
3585582 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
3585583 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
3585584 the human race has improved everything except the human race adlai stephenson
3585585 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
3585586 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine
3585587 to the point where kids just start doing drugs or just kill themselves
3585588 we need to protect our children from being bullied at school
3585589 and with the advent of new technologies the cell phone pager and blackberrys were seeing increasing instances of children getting harassing messages through electronic means what this bill does is it stops that and allows school districts to take action against people that do that
3585590 if its going to happen once it happens on many occasions and some of those happen during school hours or on school grounds
3585591 it can get out of hand but still you cant stop a person from talking about somebody else its just reality its bound to happen no matter what

3585610 in 2005 the sinfonietta came to the adler looking for a visual backdrop for the planets performances and basically the adler asked me because of all my interests in art classical music and graphic arts
3585611 id been looking for the perfect project and this was it
3585612 leading the viewer through the promenade passages walking through the
3585613 the planets is about planting the seed about inspiring people to learn more about the solar system in general and hopefully grab a book got to the planetarium or next time theyre switching channels and see a documentary to stop and watch it
3585614 astronomy uses cutting edge technology and data for scientific purposes but for education and outreach also its a great way to engage audiences who are not science attendant
3585615 my interests are not only in science but in technology graphic arts photography i even compose music a bit i use it all to engage people
3585616 the planets is a good synthesis of the things we have achieved in solar system exploration it doesnt cover absolutely everything but its a very very good summary
3585617 whats interesting is that many people will come out of the concert learning so much just from looking at the visualizations
3585618 its so exciting to see the conductor synching the music to the visuals
3585619 and to see people coming out of the hall and saying wow i didnt know that jupiter had so many moons its so very rewarding
3585620 your a strange one here play with this doll i took it from my sisters room but i doubt she would care if you had it

3585631 the iphone meets our minimum requirements and can be moved to the appliance support level which means support is limited to a narrow set of applications such as voice e mail personal information manager and browsing
3585632 consisting of a combination of alpha numeric and special characters in a pattern that cannot be easily guessed
3585633 must employ previously released methods such as imap internet message access protocol in the concierge support level or await third party products that can tie into the security policy features delivered with the firmware 2 0 upgrade
3585634 organizationally were heading towards migration from lotus notes to exchange which will take some time once weve done that well evaluate the use of iphone versus blackberry
3585635 the device can be wiped clean via the issuance of a standard instruction from exchange and can force the use of a complex password if the alphanumeric setting is checked on the exchange 2003 sp2 or 2007 administrative console
3585636 the iphone reacts similarly to a windows mobile device clearing contents when the security policy is violated
3585637 microsoft uses a confusing approach assuming that the end device will decide on what type of password will be enforced when the policy is received by the device there is no feedback to the console that the policy has been enforced windows mobile interprets the alphanumeric parameter as an instruction to force the user to employ a complex password the iphone replicates this function in the same manner despite microsofts awkward implementation

3585645 art thou not the creator wilt thou forsake the work of thine own hands art thou not the redeemer thou hast redeemed thy servant wilt thou cast me away
3585646 thou art a father and wouldst thou chasten us as though thou wouldst kill a father and hast thou no sympathy and no bowels of compassion a father and canst thou deny what thine own child asks of thee
3585647 i may safely ask of him again for he knows me and has been always very kind
3585648 i have never worried him before he cannot say he has already done all he can for me i will make bold to begin with him

3585658 terrorism in some form or another has been around since the dawn of time
3585659 but to really pick a start date one has to go back to 1756 and give the nod to zulfikar khan
3585660 they dont know where they came from they dont understand the history a lot of great people died to make terrorism today possible
3585661 when i was a kid we got five maybe six virgins who needs 72 the excess is unnecessary
3585662 well be lucky if terrorism makes it another 50 years let alone 250

3585668 this expansion will introduce mobile phone services to remote and war torn areas which lag far behind in the nations reconstruction efforts and for which telecom services are vital
3585669 it will give people in remote areas better access to markets access to information and will support families and communities that are often fragmented
3585670 it will also be a great boost for the private sector by helping businesses access new parts of the country

3585697 the results suggest that efforts should be made to develop drugs that could be given in a controlled clinical or treatment environment in which addicts would have their most potent drug memories reactivated
3585698 this is an example of hypothesis driven basic research that can be readily translated to the treatment of cocaine addiction in humans
3585699 he insinuated threats against us and said we had to continue doing what we were doing
3585700 i know for a fact that he was an informant during the time that he was dealing with us
3585701 his argument would basically be that gonzales threatened him as a government agent in order to induce him to plant the sniffer
3585702 he would not have planted the sniffer but for the threat and his sentence was based on that

3585712 cyberbullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
3585713 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area
3585714 as a tool to address all manner of cyber crimes
3585715 moreover the vehicle for the cyberbullying at issue here a social networking web site only became mainstream after 2000
3585716 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3585717 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3585718 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3585719 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3585720 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3585721 how in the world can that happen the answer is you dont know
3585722 i want her to admit she did something wrong i think people need to be held accountable for their actions

3585726 is it just a maintenance documentation problem or was there a failure to do any maintenance work
3585727 saya akui ada masanya saya tidak dapat memberikan butir penuh kepada media kerana kita tidak mahu menjejaskan siasatan
3585728 siasatan mengenai kes itu sudah selesai dan kita sudah serahkan kepada pejabat pendakwa raya untuk tindakan lanjut
3585729 kejadian itu tiada kaitan dengan anggota polis tetapi kita sudah mengenal pasti siapa yang bertanggungjawab terhadap kehilangan itu dan di mana dadah itu berada
3585730 saya difahamkan tiada kajian dilakukan mengenai habitat asal ular berkenaan selain kawasan persekitarannya sebelum ia dibeli dan ditempatkan di taman itu
3585731 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3585732 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3585733 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

3585744 look at how great i am because of what i did with war kids relief
3585745 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3585746 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3585747 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3585748 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3585749 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3585750 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3585751 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3585752 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3585753 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3585754 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3585755 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3585756 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3585757 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3585758 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3585759 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3585760 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3585761 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3585762 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3585763 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3585764 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3585765 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3585766 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3585767 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3585768 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3585769 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3585770 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3585771 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3585772 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political
3585773 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3585774 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
3585775 hello my future girlfriend this is what i sound like
3585776 unless the country is protected dharma cannot be protected and unless dharma is protected the country cannot be protected
3585777 kalian bisa melihat kapur yg ditangan saya ini atau tidak
3585778 jadi kalo kalian tidak bisa melihatnya tuhan itu ada atau tidak
3585779 these are good how come you havent told me about this before
3585780 i kind of play the dad business by ear i found out that it wasnt like father knows best and leave it to beaver those were my ideas of fatherhood and the way it was supposed to work it was like honey im home and the kids would all sit around the table and eat their peas and they would have interesting little adventures and i wasnt prepared for the realities of fatherhood so i ended up writing a lot of books about fatherhood to try and understand it better because in some ways thats what fiction writers do we write to try and figure out how we feel about certain things the shining for instance with the homicidal father i had feelings of anger about my kids that i never expected i had never been led to believe by sitcom tv or movies like a wonderful life that it was ever possible to think wont this darned kid ever go to bed and let me write and jack torrence came out of that experience an attempt to understand that experience
3585781 it is a cheap e mail being circulated around by the companys staff my children had seen the photographs and it is really embarrassing
3585782 i decided to put a stop to this it is also a sort of punishment
3585783 i was in complete shock i hadnt thought about anything but having another baby with this donor it was just so surprising and bewildering
3585784 id love to give him a full sibling but i just couldnt do it its so unfortunate
3585785 in addition to being tall and well educated their motivations for donation are quite sincere they want to help childless couples they tended to sell out very fast
3585786 theres a huge demand and the fda is essentially saying to these patients they cant choose the characteristics of the children they want even though there is absolutely no scientific evidence on their side
3585787 i noticed the enlargement and also the texture began to look like an orange peel
3585788 i just heard the word cancer and it blew my mind
3585789 i was very very scared i was looking at the fact that i had a child and the word cancer is not a good word to hear
3585790 the issue with the inflammatory disease is that generally by the time the disease is manifest it has spread to other areas of the body and is more difficult to fully detect
3585791 weve been told to make sure to give yourself a self exam to make sure you dont have a lump
3585792 but there has been little education on inflammatory breast cancer so we need to get that type of breast cancer out and let women as well as men know that type of cancer exists

3585801 i was in complete shock i hadnt thought about anything but having another baby with this donor it was just so surprising and bewildering
3585802 id love to give him a full sibling but i just couldnt do it its so unfortunate
3585803 in addition to being tall and well educated their motivations for donation are quite sincere they want to help childless couples they tended to sell out very fast
3585804 theres a huge demand and the fda is essentially saying to these patients they cant choose the characteristics of the children they want even though there is absolutely no scientific evidence on their side
3585805 would not be in the best interest of the community
3585806 she was very pleased at the division of paroles decision
3585807 its just like if a police officer chats to somebody its part of the investigative process
3585808 we had a lot of work to do obviously to get in a position where apple and at amp t would feel good about best buy mobile carrying it and thats what weve done in the last 18 months
3585809 as much as we have given the eastern people their right to own land we will soon ensure that northern people would be free to do likewise
3585810 i believe that we need to create a special committee in the u s senate to exercise oversight over contracting abuses related to reconstruction and the wars in iraq and afghanistan
3585811 i still believe that we need to establish a bipartisan truman committee with subpoena power to exercise the oversight that these abuses demand
3585812 the palestinian side will only accept a palestinian state with territorial continuity with holy jerusalem as its capital without settlements and on the june 4 1967 boundaries

3585814 hi yeah i was wondering if there was some sort of database error i cant seem to log in but ill just reregister
3585815 i believe it was the holy koran which i keep with me in the truck that saved me from the bullets
3585816 in the summer months i would expect to be attacked once or twice a week
3585817 last week we were caught up in an attack on a convoy of fuel trucks on a road we are working on it looked like a war zone with five diesel tanks burst open by rocket propelled grenades and burning diesel flooding out over the road
3585818 the talibans new tactics of blowing bridges between kabul and kandahar forcing convoys to slow down and become softer targets is causing severe problems to companies trying to supply kandahar from kabul
3585819 stopping all non essential movement and offensive operations because of fuel shortages
3585820 the concept of electricity saving box is to help stabilize voltages for end users thus reduce electric power consumption and prolong the lifespan of the appliance
3585821 i really cant adlib in front of a group of people so im just going to recite verbatim what i have written on each slide okay
3585822 no you should explain what it means on the slide what if someone only reads the powerpoint slide
3585823 then why dont i just prepare a word document with all the pertinent information and email it to everyone
3585824 oh my god people do you realize what this means
3585825 im sorry i only understand information presented to me in a circle
3585826 the ramifications of this whole episode on me and my family have been devastating and the mayors actions and the superintendents public silence has forced me to recognize that i have neither the trust confidence or respect of the mayor nor the superintendent
3585827 i have at all times tried to fair and honest with the students the faculty the staff and the community
3585828 at all times i have done what i have felt was in the best interests of the high school
3585829 dr sullivan will long be remembered in gloucester for the many individual families he helped over the past 10 years i wish him all the best in his retirement
3585830 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3585831 this is one of the more prolific distributors that weve ever seen and obviously he was providing these images to lots of people
3585832 while that continues to be very sophisticated the good news is that law enforcement as well is stepping up their cooperation and technology to track these down
3585833 hoewel iedereen het recht heeft om een herkansing te doen om eventueel cijfers op te krikken zag mijn dochter hiervan af ze was inmiddels geslaagd en dit diploma was voldoende voor haar vervolgopleiding
3585834 er was een fout gemaakt latoya kwam wat tienden tekort maar de herexamens waren dus al geweest hoewel de school in eerste instantie wel de hand in eigen boezem wilde steken en mijn dochter haar diploma wilde geven is dit teruggefloten door de onderwijsinspectie
3585835 als direct duidelijk was geweest dat ze niet voldoende punten had gehaald was de kans dus groter dat ze uiteindelijk haar diploma zou krijgen dan nu het geval is
3585836 i think the key to the game was not getting the last out of the first inning he said

3585841 wie sollte ein review zu einem film bzw einer serie aufgebaut strukturiert sein
3585842 i am waiting to see the commitments they will make on issues like international justice refugees and how to address the needs of children in crisis around the world
3585843 todays humanitarian crisis in iraq and the potential consequences for our national security are great can the united states afford to gamble that 4 million or more poor and displaced people in the heart of middle east wont explode in violent desperation sending the whole region into further disorder
3585844 what we cannot afford in my view is to squander the progress that has been made
3585845 i think people assume im a democrat but im registered independent and im still undecided so im looking at mccain as well as obama
3585846 this moisturizing really works on me i can see the difference when i use it and it lasts
3585847 i tried this cream and there was no effect on me no particular super moisturizing effect on my skin
3585848 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3585849 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3585850 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3585851 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3585852 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3585853 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3585854 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3585855 work is either fun or drudgery it depends on your attitude i like fun
3585856 i didnt knows from your clients and would be clients
3585857 quality public education in crisis today will either propel or crash the future aspirations of the american workforce
3585858 encouraging students to challenge themselves and expand their horizons is always a good thing
3585859 the pressure to grow up fast to achieve early is the very great in middle class america there is no room today for the late bloomer
3585860 how would you describe being poor in the united states
3585861 just one gift campaign kids were encouraged with motivational sayings to see themselves and their unique talents abilities time and acts of service as gifts to the ones they love and to the world
3585862 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3585863 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3585864 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3585865 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3585866 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3585867 apology looked like something youd see compelled from a hostage at gunpoint
3585868 ive met melissa and found her to be intelligent and engaging unlike some of the dolts theyve run through their in and out reporter mill
3585869 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3585870 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3585871 would you like to sit on the porch or would you rather live
3585872 its not a masterpiece but itll be hard to find a more exciting game at fenway park than this thing
3585873 the liberal is continually angry as only a self important man can be with his civilization his culture his country and his folks back home his is an infantile world view at the core of a liberal is the spoiled child miserable as all spoiled children are unsatisfied demanding ill disciplined despotic and useless liberalism is a philosophy of sniveling brats
3585874 liberals are generous with other peoples money except when it comes to questions of national survival when they prefer to be generous with other peoples freedom and security
3585875 weve fallen in love with arizona wines and want to share them its just that simple were winos
3585876 wine is often associated with california france and italy but it doesnt require world travel we can think globally and drink locally
3585877 its also fascinating to consider the potential reduction on our ecological footprint just by supporting local businesses imagining the emissions caused by shipping products is certainly a downside to the global marketplace
3585878 i think it has been clear throughout the games that we are certainly not rooting for the americans
3585879 the excitement that we had was just simply about an unbelievable piece of drama in the pool
3585880 a way to wrap up the story maybe it didnt sound that way but that was my intent
3585881 this new fire station is in keeping with my commitment to the safety of district d residents
3585882 anyone who has been in an emergency knows that every second counts and with this new station south houston residents will see marked improvements in the citys response times
3585883 what will happen if i have a heart attack tomorrow morning who will take charge
3585884 you feel as if you are in the antechamber of god and you are waiting to hear next
3585885 it is well documented that the council is under financial pressure given this it is unlikely the council would want to add an additional concert hall with major operating and long term maintenance costs to its inventory
3585886 i am going to make submissions to as many as i can who i think will keep it as a theatre
3585887 but i wouldnt care if i never made a cent out of it
3585888 there were some scenes that we thought to be too dangerous but she insisted on doing away with the body double and also the wirings
3585889 shes very athletic it runs in her family then there was akshay kumar to inspire her akshay had done so much on screen action it was a novel experience for deepika and she sailed through the action she worked really hard to get the posture and power in the action scenes those whove seen her in om shanti om will be shocked
3585890 the films flavour comes from akshays real life hes a boy from chandni chowk in old delhi who went to bangkok as a cook my writer sridhar raghavan wrote the role with akshays real life story in mind
3585891 the characters personality comes alive through akshay thanks to him we finished ahead of schedule
3585892 chandni chowk to china is a childrens film i dont think kids will try to attempt to climb the nearest wall to fight after watching the film but well have lots of kids joining karate classes
3585893 before i started making this film my interest in the martial arts was restricted to jackie chan et li bruce lee and the crouching tigers of the world but akshay brought out the hidden dragon in me
3585894 he made me watch a lot of action scenes before we left for china hed make me sit down every morning and make me watch one kung fu film and explain the subtexts by the time we left to shoot i understood the martial arts much better
3585895 every breath is a choice every minute is a choice to be or not to be
3585896 i once asked if you could turn into a bat and you just laughed
3585897 because it was a stupid question we dont turn into bats why would we want to turn into bats
3585898 i said we turn into fruit its great for disguising yourself
3585899 no why cant you understand im a danger to you i could kill you i should leave you forever

3585902 her daughter is not going to be protected society is not going to be protected and other alonzo de la torres are not going to be protected
3585903 i said this is more than just a bad storm
3585904 i was feeling neglected because only one tv meteorologist said that it was a tornado
3585905 its like csi we go back to the scene of the crime and see what happened
3585906 the radar is designed to detect the rotation that occurs in the storm but we never know for sure if there is a tornado on the ground until we go out there
3585907 discrimination against families with children remains a serious problem in the northern suburbs

3585913 my friend ganesha 2 a sequel to one of the popular animated features of last year is ready and scheduled for aug 22 release and the director says that it has more westernised ganesha
3585914 the first part was a hit among children they were infatuated by the westernised ganesha in the sequel the ganesha has been given a more modern look and he speaks english fluently now please dont ask me to reveal the plot
3585915 when the song was being picturised on a street in mumbai a crowd of about 5 000 onlookers gathered there many of the children from the crowd joined in the procession and that made the scene look real
3585916 the movie has been telecast 53 times on tv since its release in july last year that itself is a proof of the fact that the concept was hit among children
3585917 similar but similar enough that they could probably slip this into a cable re airing of
3585918 a novel that since its publication in 1932 has probably been read by only two people namely james wood and joseph roth
3585919 the cheapest car to run is the car you already own
3585920 id like to explain how a dashingly youthful 59 year old came to be driving a geezermobile in the first place
3585921 fruit is generally expensive in japan and people often buy grapes peaches and melons as luxury gifts japanese are often willing to pay top prices for high end fruits especially for the prestige of owning the very first ones of the year
3585922 maybe if you ask me in a week i could tell you everything is going to be ok but right now im still kind of sick about the whole thing
3585923 probably left also but hes used to the right side if we moved cordy to a right tackle we could move kiante tripp over to left tackle i would say that would exhaust the possibilities
3585924 i think just watching cordy it didnt take long at all to say he can do it physically this year
3585925 the question is how quickly can he learn hes been running with the no 1 unit for a few days now at guard
3585926 to know the backside of your qb is protected and to know that he understands what to do is critical
3585927 hes just bigger stronger and more experienced than he was a year ago and he did a pretty good job a year ago its sad for him of course because he worked so hard he got up to the 310 pound range and was as strong as hes ever been was practicing so well its hard to lose experience
3585928 maybe if you ask me in a week i could tell you everything is going to be ok but right now im still kind of sick about the whole thing

3585934 one thousand years after the formidable war machines of the user cultures devoured entire civilizations and rewrote planetary geography earth is in the grip of a perpetual dark age scientific endeavor is strongly discouraged while remnant technology is locked away hidden by a church determined to prevent a new armageddon this is the world to which benzamir michael mahmood must return a descendant of the tribes who fled the planet during those ages old wars he comes in pursuit of enemies from the far reaches of space the technology he brings is wondrous beyond the imaginings of those he will meet but can its potency match that of the churchs most closely guarded treasure for centuries it has lain dormant but it is about to be unearthed and the powers that will be unleashed may be beyond anyones capacity to control even a man as extraordinary as benzamir

3585937 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure

3585948 what carr excels at where his gifts as a journalist shine is explaining how an addicts life works the economics of it the ad hoc social web the quotidian feel of the thing its an essay in urban typology worthy of balzac at his keenest and least windy
3585949 ehrenreich is at her best and shes very very good when chronicling the outrageous human downside of our economy the costs it imposes on people who cant afford a bacon infused old fashioned
3585950 the voices ebershoff has brought to life here dramatize one of the most remarkable periods of americas religious history and hes just as discerning about the bizarre descendants that can sprout like toxic weeds from a founders revelation
3585951 traffic gets about as close to the heart of modern existence as any book could get yet habits of empire by walter nugent
3585952 although pelecanos pays homage to his crime writing roots uncoiling a lethal subplot involving no good charles baker that spurs a fitting if bloody resolution it is the central questions of how men can have purpose and atone for their sins that makes the turnaround an indelible read
3585953 fuller never met him bryant but re creating him has dragged her into a world of greed and power and destruction and beauty more instructive on the unsettled state of the democratic party and its current leftward drift we are witnessing a tectonic shift from the centrism that president clinton embraced and imposed on his restive followers to a more open throated liberalism now referred to as progressivism that is angry and spoiling for a fight

3585960 most other olympics acquired their label during or after the games usually after emotions had coalesced or a big news event pushed other stories off the front page but the combination of fascination with china and increasingly intense churn of media attention has changed that
3585961 la trova cubana se enfrenta a f rmulas donde lo efectista y lo superficial se venden como infalibles atajos al xito quiz me equivoque pero pongo muy en duda la garant a duradera de estas f rmulas
3585962 hay de todo tanto en est ticas como en niveles de calidad
3585963 aqu cabr a un paralelo con la sociedad cubana el arte como siempre reflejando lo que pasa de igual manera que cuba podr a adoptar f rmulas econ micas asi ticas en pos de resultados a corto plazo mientras sigue postergando giros profundos hacia m s participaci n m s debate y menos centralizaci n pues la trova cubana se enfrenta a f rmulas donde lo efectista y lo superficial se venden como infalibles atajos al xito quiz me equivoque pero pongo muy en duda la garant a duradera de estas f rmulas
3585964 creo que eso les hizo m s da o que bien creo que muchos no ten an la madurez creativa que fundamentara un impulso promocional de esa magnitud lo que gener muchas cr ticas y una fue que hab a demasiada continuidad y muy poca ruptura con respecto al legado est tico de la nueva trova
3585965 lo que quiero se alar es que los que salimos despu s tuvimos la oportunidad de extraer moraleja de todo eso y afrontar el oficio desde un ngulo enriquecido
3585966 ahora bien no hay una difusi n completa si no se escucha tu m sica en la radio o la tv
3585967 si este acceso casi no ocurre y si cuando ocurre se hace a la carrera sin un trabajo serio de mesa con un productor
3585968 para m lo peor no es que se demore el momento de grabar tu disco sino que cuando llegue sea como una especie de favor que te hacen y no se haga con rigor falta mucho aquella labor de los agentes que vayan a los conciertos y a las descargas a descubrir posibles talentos y sean capaces de complementar las carencias ejecutivas del artista es como si no existiera ese trabajo en cuba y es importante porque las disqueras deber an preocuparse por dejar a la posteridad la m sica de estos tiempos en un sentido abarcador y desprejuiciado y con la mejor calidad
3585969 una cosa que a menudo veo que falta entre los trovadores es una informaci n musical contempor nea abarcadora
3585970 cada vez que los trovadores hacemos un concierto donde se nota un trabajo de mesa y se ve el desarrollo de intenciones en funci n de una idea crecemos much simo porque es como un signo de madurez como contraparte al peligro del que hablaba antes ese de caer en la trampa de lo impactante y lo r tmico guarachoso como nica v a al xito lo tengo muy de cerca cada noche de jueves en nuestro espacio la tanda donde excelentes trovadores tienen que limitarse a echar mano a lo m s movidito de su repertorio por temor a que la bulla de estos tiempos apurados se los trague lo peor es cuando se empieza a componer en funci n de eso y se entroniza la vertiente como paradigma mayor
3585971 me veo en un subgrupo que juega insistentemente mezclando las sonoridades cubanas con otras que a n resultan medio extra as
3585972 recientemente hice un tema que intenta un poco autodefinirme como buen autorretrato dice m s lo que quisiera ser que lo que realmente soy el verso final es casi una cita de un verso de la trovadora rita del prado esto es un fragmento

3585985 as part of this years budget we know we are looking at some difficult times over the next three years
3585986 as a citizen i much prefer to know what i am paying you dont need to hide it under another name this is coming out of my pocket and im prepared to pay it
3585987 sen hagel has no intention of getting involved in any of the campaigns and is not planning to endorse either candidate
3585988 it is not business as usual anymore with the russians and there are consequences for doing what they are doing
3585989 russia has one foot integrated into the international economy and community of states and one foot that is not quite in it
3585990 whether they havent achieved some tactical objectives at the expense of some strategic objectives
3585991 i wanted to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and people and are reviewing options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia
3585992 but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop
3585993 we are not happy with the way the united states has been behaving especially the way the united states has been propping up mr saakashvili over the past few years
3585994 i hope we continue normal relations with the united states and the rest of the international community
3585995 we have equal interests between the russian federation and the united states we should look and try to resolve this international crisis
3585996 this is a parting gift from the bush administration to its timber friends
3585997 it flies in the face of the science that says we need to protect more habitat not less
3585998 after almost 20 years of relying on a static regulatory approach which has led to continual inaction and further decline of the owl it is clear we should be using to improve the health of our forests and the spotted owl
3585999 unfortunately this designation doubles down on a patently absurd approach
3586000 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3586001 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be the biggest environmental disaster of all time
3586002 its not going backwards it is actually recognising that we are with nature not against it we have gone working against nature for too long
3586003 proud citizen of the united states and a fellow citizen of the world
3586004 it just kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest i wanted to go 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad
3586005 the protests are the manifestation of an anger that the peace process doesnt seem to have achieved anything
3586006 the peace process has not addressed the concerns of kashmiris they want to see an end to uncertainty they want a resolution of the kashmir dispute
3586007 the protests are serious and should serve as a wake up call
3586008 firing on protesters speaks of indian double standards in jammu three protesters were killed during several days of curfew but in the muslim kashmir valley six people are martyred on the very first day of a curfew
3586009 after these shooting incidents we have lost whatever love we had for indians
3586010 the rising pro freedom protests will definitely give impetus to the freedom struggle
3586011 what we are seeing is the revival of the separatist movement in kashmir which had been in a dying stage
3586012 firing on unarmed civilians will alienate people further and serve the cause of separatists
3586013 the last couple of years its been a good league but one of the downfalls has been the limited number of games in the season
3586014 so it will be good to have a longer season and i guess that helps australian based players in regards to making the national team as well
3586015 if there are more games there are more chances of making the national team as well
3586016 obviously the league had to land on its feet first we all knew when it started that eight wasnt enough but the league had to establish itself and i think its well and truly grounded now
3586017 its ready for another couple of teams and hopefully they get it right
3586018 hopefully theyre financially viable and all very competitive on the field and if thats the case its great news for the league to get another two teams and make the season a bit longer and more aligned with the european amount of games
3586019 i do support expansion but its just one of those things that if they can only have one team and they make sure its a strong one team then thats great
3586020 because at the end of the day you want to have a product thats a good product
3586021 i think we are definitely in a position to bring one in whether thats the gold coast or wherever it may be i think over time well see the league expand
3586022 there has been a lot of talk in this trial about anti muslim sentiment and anti muslim feeling in the community justice bongiorno said
3586023 prejudice sympathy and such things have no part in a criminal trial
3586024 you must reach a unanimous verdict for each case guilty or acquit
3586025 twelve accused and 13 counts in fact because some appear together there are actually 27 different trials occurring
3586026 what that means is you must consider each count and each accused as a completely separate trial
3586027 you can only use those recordings of the individual accused when youre asking yourself is so and so a member
3586028 ive always felt like we have the best fans in the nfl and that they would support our team regardless of how they feel about myself or brett or management or whatever
3586029 but it was a great reception when we took the field
3586030 i understand the attention around him his performance tonight and him playing tonight
3586031 but i saw aaron just like he is every day i thought he went out there he played with excellent energy which i always recall him playing with i think hes done a really good job being consistent and understanding that the microscope is on him with all the attention but those are really outside external forces that we cant really pay attention to
3586032 offensively we got off to a slow start but we picked up the pace as the half went on
3586033 tracey draws us into the world of family and friendship with a few surprising twists along the way bravo
3586034 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
3586035 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
3586036 no evidence sufficient to support the claim that an observed association between abortion history and mental health was caused by the abortion per se as opposed to other factors
3586037 global statements about the psychological impact of abortion can be misleading
3586038 help disentangle confounding factors and establish relative risks of abortion compared to its alternatives
3586039 good for peter hildreth my mum used to train by running up the down escalator when she played for the provincial field hockey team
3586040 the recurring phrases of salome bind it together like a piece of music
3586041 the recurring phrases of salome bind it together like a piece of music
3586042 contrary to blog speculation people did not photo shop vivienne marcheline smile one can only guess that she is smiling because her parents are angelina jolie and brad pitt
3586043 they dont have anything else for him to do so hes sitting in china watching games
3586044 sharing food with another human being is an intimate act that should not be indulged in lightly
3586045 its one of these recognitions that you would never want
3586046 i dont think there could be a more fitting place in the county to have a memorial for my brother
3586047 its so nice to have the two combined because thats the way everybody saw them
3586048 you never saw jesse g on that field without his daddy there
3586049 if you could trace their footsteps on this field and these fields around here they would be everywhere
3586050 when they were together and on that field that was the happiest place for them
3586051 tackle some of the places business and abandoned homes and areas of the community that have been tagged by graffiti
3586052 as in any other organization right now were finding ourselves short of money
3586053 the longer it stays up the more the graffiti will be added to and the harder it will be to actually get it removed and not have repeat graffiti put up there
3586054 gang graffiti can be very similar to the newspaper of the streets
3586055 so the quicker its removed the more that message it sent to the criminals that were not going to take your graffiti on our wall and theyll move on to a different area
3586056 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3586057 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3586058 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3586059 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3586060 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3586061 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3586062 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3586063 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3586064 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3586065 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3586066 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3586067 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3586068 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3586069 if you can get past the idea that fakeness is a bad thing use a fancier term like artifice if that helps you then
3586070 the surfaces are precisely what make the hills entrancing it is possibly the best looking series on television it doesnt just look better than life it looks better than tv where most reality shows use garish close ups to show hot emotions the hills uses middle and long range shots in wide screen giving it a cooler feel and framing the subjects like art photography its full of liquid l a sun in love with the way light plays on surfaces car bodies plate glass glossed lips
3586071 i think this council has been very very clear as to what their priorities are
3586072 we just have to keep it high on the radar screen were telling citizens that when you call 911 and our officers will be there and i want to make sure theyre there
3586073 i kind of play the dad business by ear i found out that it wasnt like father knows best and leave it to beaver those were my ideas of fatherhood and the way it was supposed to work it was like honey im home and the kids would all sit around the table and eat their peas and they would have interesting little adventures and i wasnt prepared for the realities of fatherhood so i ended up writing a lot of books about fatherhood to try and understand it better because in some ways thats what fiction writers do we write to try and figure out how we feel about certain things the shining for instance with the homicidal father i had feelings of anger about my kids that i never expected i had never been led to believe by sitcom tv or movies like a wonderful life that it was ever possible to think wont this darned kid ever go to bed and let me write and jack torrence came out of that experience an attempt to understand that experience
3586074 and that was that then sarah started saying sorry to jordan sarah had her first time out on the weekend for hitting jordan eric did it with her as i was cooking and she also did not like it and tried to escape she did like apologizing to jordan afterward though i think jordan sometimes likes the imposed downtime friday night at bedtime jordan was absolutely crazy he freaked out while eric removed his diaper and then would not calm down to go in the bath he was hysterical and naked and wouldnt brush his teeth or bathe i wasnt sure what to do so finally i asked do you want to sit alone on a towel in the hallway

3586078 boicottiamo litalia tagliando i rapporti diplomatici con il suo governo e ritirando tutti gli ambasciatori arabi da roma non possiamo stare zitti davanti al tentativo di chiudere la moschea di viale jenner a milano
3586079 se e vero quanto fatto dal governo italiano e confermato dai media a proposito della chiusura della moschea di milano e di altre citta affermiamo che si tratta di un atto inaccettabile sul quale non possiamo tacere il governo egiziano insieme a quelli di tutti i paesi arabo islamici deve velocemente assumere una posizione molto forte e rompere i rapporti diplomatici subito con litalia ritirando i propri ambasciatori come ha potuto il governo italiano assumere questa posizione cosi ostile e razzista sono diventati forse la religione islamica e i suoi simboli un giocattolo in mano agli europei

3586099 i dont understand why it happened all of the sudden maybe its the economy making people go crazy and turn to crime and then i thought maybe vandalism but there are too many break ins over the last few weeks
3586100 it is sad for everybody the walkers particularly they lost a son and a husband and a daddy loss and tragedy for the glissons and for columbus
3586101 its hard to fathom it hurt a lot of people and for a city that prides itself on public safety it has caused significant problems
3586102 this settlement wont cause a recovery from this the community would always be divided i believe
3586103 there is racial tension there will always be racial tension ethnic tension

3586105 namun apa yang hendak diperkatakan lagi kerana nasi sudah menjadi bubur walaupun telah dinasihatkan oleh pemimpin tertinggi negara namun forum ini tetap diteruskan walaupun terpaksa disudahkan awal berbanding yang telah dirancang
3586106 tajuk forum ini juga dilihat sebagai provokatif yang boleh menimbulkan kemarahan rakyat malaysia terutama yang beragama islam

3586109 we think we have a pretty good handle on the situation we thought we were relatively conservative but well see how it goes
3586110 obviously this isnt something that we absolutely need to do but we stepped up to do it because we think its the right thing to do
3586111 we sleep safe in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm
3586112 its not necessarily a rise in robberies but weve noticed a trend in robberies and assaults where people basically made themselves a victim when they didnt need to be
3586113 what they are looking for are the people who are walking around with their heads down looking at the pavement completely oblivious to whats going on around them

3586119 were trying desperately to set up it systems that alert us to critical things like addresses phone numbers names that sound similar

3586129 one of the big questions of brain development is how does the blood brain barrier form and when does it form
3586130 it was built for soccer but it clearly had an understanding that it was convertible for football and to be expanded to 30 000 seats thats what city council voted on
3586131 he wants to please soccer and football fans together theres no reason they cant coexist this isnt the hatfields and the mccoys but im not sure mlse president richard peddie feels that way
3586132 the mayor has told us a number of times that if the toronto argonauts want to come to bmo field hell do all he can within the confines of his lease agreement with mlse
3586133 what we have is a 70 million public asset that is in the shape of a stadium
3586134 the primary occupant is the game of soccer and what council said in 2005 is there has to be some compatibility option for football there
3586135 it has to be an option because that was built into the approval council gave how that happens has to be worked out
3586136 i had a meeting with richard peddie three or four months ago and he informed me that in late august there may be a time to sit down and talk about what they want to see in the stadium expansion
3586137 now i understand its not on his radar screen i spoke to richard last week by e mail and its not a priority for him right now
3586138 whether we could write a cheque for stadium expansion or help secure funds im not sure but the toronto argonauts could be part of making that happen
3586139 truly id like to thank you who saved my life the gentleman who drove a silver coloured 4x4 i dont know his name but i remember he hit the bear
3586140 without him i wouldnt be here i know i only had a minute left probably less
3586141 hes going to eat me hes not going to go away
3586142 i could not sleep i have very bad dreams i still can see the bear that tried to eat me its fresh i cannot get over it right now
3586143 what we are seeing from the russians is the cold blooded calculated premeditated murder of a small nation
3586144 what is going on now in georgia is a test case this is about the russian view of the new world order versus the west view of the new world order if russia wins it will validate the russian view of the new world order
3586145 saakashvili regime may be landlocked by the end of tuesday or wednesday russia just made it clear what it thinks of bushco pipeline dreams and bushco vision of the new world order of course their co conspirators over in dc are calling it a disproportionate response
3586146 i think that the bucharest communique stands the allies have said in bucharest that one day georgia will join nato
3586147 georgia is a respected partner and friend and one day georgia will join nato
3586148 this is simply not a time for politics as usual i have no doubt that a lot of republicans will be attracted to obama in spite of the flaws in this years primary process
3586149 there is a deepening split between the traditional nixonian realist wing of the republican party and the neo conservatives that has become more pronounced with john mccains hardline anti russia rhetoric
3586150 i have good reason to believe that there will be other republicans such as james baker the former secretary of state who may withhold endorsement from mccain rather than endorse obama directly
3586151 oh ibu you dont count anymore you are one of us now
3586152 the only way i can lose this election is if im caught in bed with either a dead girl or a live boy
3586153 all three are special they are amazing and awesome its great that i got to work with three beautiful women
3586154 i always believe i am not a good dancer i become nervous while shooting a dance sequence so its a collective effort that you see on screen
3586155 it is a journey of a young man raj and three women who enter in his life at different phases
3586156 it is a youthful character he is not a casanova
3586157 i had signed the movie when saawariya had not released
3586158 please dont compare me with dad our song is just a tribute to that song
3586159 i like dads flamboyant style i have been proud of his work and learnt a lot from him
3586160 i thought he was pretty good i thought he was ok
3586161 the guy knows how to pitch thats what i get from him when im watching him he pitches very well he knows how to read swings and he definitely has good command of his pitches
3586162 i caught him last week and he was really good
3586163 but today he was better the command was there maybe the speed is not there yet but its coming
3586164 it didnt look like he was throwing that hard but hes coming off the dl
3586165 he probably doesnt have his velocity back but his stuff looked good ive never seen him before so i dont know what he looks like when hes on his off speed stuff was good but his fastball probably wasnt where he wanted it to be it would make the off speed stuff that much better
3586166 including on military and strategic facilities in the southern federal district

3586172 linking lufthansa and tams schedules will increase the benefits for our customers moreover we are stimulating growth in air traffic between germany and brazil
3586173 our evidence shows that reformers considered the patristic tradition as second only to biblical authority and used it as a critical source in vindication of their views the tradition of the church was not the same as the traditions which they opposed in fact the former helped to expose the nature of the latter

3586179 it is clear that the revenue capability of apples app store and itunes has made cloning such an offering attractive to many carriers who are trying to increase revenues while at the same time seeing decreasing profits from their basic services
3586180 clearly services is where a lot of potential profit lies what isnt so clear is the best way for the carriers to tap into this revenue but all of them will try it and some will succeed
3586181 moving forward not only the carriers but also the device manufacturers such as nokia will try to get into the services and applications sales business
3586182 i expect to see all the major carriers and more of the manufacturers provide such services even microsoft
3586183 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever after another then again count me out because that will be the biggest of all time

3586225 a doctor i love medicine my grandma is a doctor and ive always admired her for it right now i would probably be in medical school

3586229 i think id be an actress because when i was younger i was always in school plays and loved it i always wanted to be a star
3586230 id probably be a physio or a sports agent definitely something to do with sports when i was young i always thought id do something with sports
3586231 definitely something to do with helping people or animals but nothing to do with tennis probably maybe a social worker a vet or a foster parent salary wouldnt matter just the feeling of helping people
3586232 i like a lot of singers probably justin timberlake i like his style and songs hes really cool if not him then maybe 50 cent
3586233 it would have to be someone who gives back or does humanitarian work i get inspired by people that give their time and work tirelessy for worthy causes id probably pick a celebrity who does that kind of thing like angelina jolie or oprah winfrey but not because of their celebrity status
3586234 since i was young my idol has been andy roddick hes a role model for me ive never had a chance to speak with him but if it comes one day ill be so happy it would be a dream come true for me i try to hit my forehand like him my service motion is kind of like him although his serve is amazing

3586239 michael jordan the way he thinks and what he says are amazing since i was young ive been a big admirer of his he was my idol and obviously the way he plays basketball is so nice to watch i can only hope ill have the chance to meet him one day
3586240 jennifer aniston shes my favorite actor and id love to meet her one day i really love friends
3586241 i really like angelina jolie not only is she a great actress but she seems like a really interesting person im also a big fan of matt damon also a really good actor i love some of his movies like the bourne identity and the talented mr ripley
3586242 the dark gods march in step and i shall deliver them this world for their pleasure
3586243 it appears that swimming is benefiting from a number of interesting stories this year including michael phelps race for gold dara torres return to the games and park win to bring home south koreas first ever gold medal in swimming
3586244 as other events build momentum and the track and field competition begins it will be interesting to follow the fan favorites online
3586245 ray the next time someone asks if youre a god you say yes
3586246 when it was painted bright pink it was totally unacceptable
3586247 its not the councils job to deliberately offend people and by leaving it there we would deliberately offend people
3586248 this takes us back to the beginning of the last century when public artworks were censored back in britain at the beginning of modern sculpture
3586249 i feel its insulting to women to remove a vulva because of somebodys attitude
3586250 some of these so called civic leaders are a little immature themselves looking at the female creative power i guess its a very deep rooted ancient fear that men have women are able to reproduce

3586253 an open hearted indie pop sound with a touch of baroque fussiness and rich full harmonies fueled by power pop melodies
3586254 with a gazillion ideas snapped together like so many legos ponytails second album is an exhilarating puzzle
3586255 someone tried to murder me they were one step away from murdering me
3586256 what i heard the plan was break the window and come back later and finish the job
3586257 he was going to come in cut out my heart cut off my eyelids and slash my throat
3586258 he walked up to me and said hey black boy why are you so quiet today
3586259 he held this noose up and said do you know what this is used for
3586260 first of all i felt threatened i felt threatened for my life who wouldnt feel like that im scared to this day
3586261 we dont take incidents like this lightly were doing everything possible to correct the situation
3586262 im afraid for my job im afraid for my family afraid for my kids i got to look out for me
3586263 theyll kill him and we will weep in the press

3586277 al final la alta demanda se ha mantenido m s o menos como siempre
3586278 i wanted to try and get out into open water and i was in the outside lane so it was kind of difficult for the others to see me i just wanted to get out there and try to hold on
3586279 i knew park was going to have a good last 50 metres so i tried to start as far ahead as i could in the first 100m to 150m

3586289 uno de los mayores esc ndalos que ha habido hay y habr en el ayuntamiento de benidorm
3586290 aliviada de ver que salimos de all en el momento justo porque el riesgo ha sido grande
3586291 la primera noticia que recibimos del conflicto fue el d a 3 de agosto creo cuando est bamos en tiblisi y mi madre me llam y me dijo que estaban evacuando a gente en el norte del pa s pero yo le tranquilic y le dije que eso era un conflicto en el norte como si fuera el pa s vasco de espa a
3586292 y cuando est bamos en un museo o mos durante bastante tiempo disparos como si fueran fuegos artificiales o una traca yo pens al principio que ser an las fiestas del pueblo como en espa a pero continuamos oyendo y ya nos dijeron que seguramente eran entrenamientos militares
3586293 y parece que por un d a no nos ha pillado todo luego nos empezaron a llegar noticias del conflicto pero es como si te faltara informaci n mi madre estaba m s preocupada que yo porque dec a que hab a muertos aunque nosotros ya no est bamos en georgia
3586294 tres de las chicas que son de georgia no han vuelto a n a su pa s porque no saben si podr n llegar
3586295 porque los del ministerio de exteriores nos han dicho que salgamos tambi n de aqu cuanto antes por si acaso aunque aqu no pasa nada
3586296 no hemos sabido la magnitud de lo ocurrido hasta que logramos salir de georgia
3586297 nuestro tren desde tiblisi debi ser el ltimo en salir porque en seguida cerraron la frontera
3586298 exports many of the procedure and syntax bindings that are traditionally associated with scheme
3586299 scheme with subtle semantic extensions that programmers probably wont notice unless they actually use them
3586300 ah heck i always wanted to design my own lisp
3586301 no deja de sorprender que la portavoz popular estuviera al lado del gobierno de aznar cuando llev a cabo el deslinde y ahora afirme que quiere trabajar para deshacerlo
3586302 es un brindis al sol pues implica a un departamento de la generalitat que carece de competencias para actuar en esta materia
3586303 i got the sense she was trying to tell me where her master was
3586304 she was a very intelligent dog to live for that long
3586305 she was jumping on me and excited to get out of there she got in the truck and was licking on me
3586306 he went running towards her trying to feed her treats
3586307 they would go to a park and they would play fetch forever and ever and ever
3586308 trash cans turned over cat smells all over the city cats with skin problems and lameness wandering in and out of vacated old buildings
3586309 in my book leaving cats to wander in the streets of san juan is in itself cruelty to animals
3586310 we want to make the cats lives as good as possible
3586311 avoid using null on string based fields such as charfield and
3586312 even with the cameras the family was a joy to work with
3586313 i wanted them to fall in love with this area the way i have by the end the kids were more excited than anybody
3586314 i probably drove my husband wxia meteorologist chris holcomb crazy trying to find the perfect outfits
3586315 this lawsuit is totally baseless and without merit among other factual inaccuracies suggested in the complaint it is indisputable that ms hall left the group voluntarily and on her own accord we are absolutely confident that this matter will be resolved in favor of jennifer and kristian

3586319 brite strike can reach a greater investor audience further its strategic goals and enhance shareholder value by becoming a fully reporting company
3586320 we have the infrastructure in place to make this move and i believe it is an important step for us to take as we begin to execute the early phase of our strategic business plan to drive growth and market reach of our unparalleled non lethal protection devices to an increasing number of police military and civilians
3586321 our focus is on led lighting products and fixtures that can directly replace existing incandescent fluorescent and halogen bulbs in any household or commercial application
3586322 the extendlite led lights provide consumers with more versatility and make it easier to do so
3586323 leds can last up to 100 000 hours approximately 11 years and operate more than 20 times longer than the equivalent incandescent lamp
3586324 savings from reduced maintenance costs and downtime quickly return the capital investment expenditure and led lamps require 80 90 less operating power than their incandescent equivalents making them as friendly to the environment as they are to the operating budget
3586325 our design team and engineers created a clever concept it provides the best of both worlds to consumers a lantern for area lighting as well as portable personal light sources similar to flashlights for individual use it is very functional and versatile and can be used indoors or outdoors
3586326 im pleased with our strong sales growth for the quarter which i believe reflects the strength of our new product offerings and marketing programs as well as a consumer shift towards value brands during this tough economic time
3586327 the safety of our fellow officers is paramount and its the whole reason we designed this product to begin with we welcome any opportunity to get our equipment into the hands of those who need it most plus these experienced professionals provide us with useful feedback on the lights design ease of use and effectiveness
3586328 we are working hard to help pave the way in sustainability for the vehicle rack and cargo categories and will continue to expand upon these initiatives by constantly exploring new technologies and materials
3586329 these products give eco conscious consumers a more sustainable way to carry gear
3586330 moto u9 is a stylish phone designed for trendsetters seeking to make a fashion statement
3586331 the four leaders are working with their local business partners in markets around the world to build and distribute a pre loaded pc offering that features ibms open collaboration client solution occs including lotus notes lotus symphony and lotus sametime the linux operating system of each distributor and software applications and installation services from the local partners in each market
3586332 how come sun and openoffice org arent directly involved in this microsoft free pc effort is openoffice org assisting the effort at all
3586333 well yes theyre all using our software the openoffice org community maintains the openoffice org software assisted by generous sponsorship from sun ibm novell redflag red hat etc several of these companies then use the software as a base for their own products suns staroffice ibms symphony redflags redoffice canonical red hat and novell will now have distributions both with openoffice org and with ibms symphony that provides choice to their customers as they can choose which flavour of software suits them best the really good news is that both software packages use the iso approved opendocument format to store their documents so people can happily swap backwards and forwards between openoffice org and symphony without losing any data formatting etc the significant difference between openoffice org and ms office is microsofts marketing budget ibm also have considerable marketing budgets so hopefully this will help to redress the balance
3586334 19 remembered not nearly as well and yet sounding far less dated for the trouble
3586335 a nightmare is much more intense than a bad dream it can arouse feelings of fear horror and distress it replicates our deepest fears and can reflect the different types of stresses we face in our waking world
3586336 nightmarish thoughts such as losing your job being homeless falling and being chased are a manifestation of how much the credit crunch is affecting our daily lives and causing distressed sleep patterns
3586337 for example dreaming about being chased or falling is a reaction to the stresses we face in life the attacker or falling in the dream represents the emotion of fear and anxiety
3586338 its no wonder gordon brown and alistair darling are making a special appearance in our nightmares at the moment both symbolise the fears we are facing in todays economy
3586339 the real china is infinitely varied and complex full of love and happiness and generosity and tolerance and strong family values
3586340 they looked through me stony faced as if i did not exist
3586341 heavy lifting man stuff and to make sure we didnt get molested by any pirates while out at sea i know i know give me a break
3586342 first thing they should do is call their lender because the lender needs to know and theyre really helpful as far as working with you to make sure that you do not need to lose your house
3586343 no lenders dont want homes lenders are there to lend money and thats what they want to do
3586344 if its only temporary and its for three to six months maybe you have a medical emergency that you hadnt even thought about and youre short of funds what theyll do is theyll work with you on a payment plan
3586345 dont do that that person is not your lender hes not going to be your friend you should call your lender and not talk to these other people because what hes really trying to do is take your home away from you
3586346 and they can tell you exactly what payments you are to make and then once they get you back on track i would suggest that you go to some type of financial planner
3586347 we would like to bring the power source to where its needed versus making larger power plants and transmitting that power to vast areas
3586348 your primary source of energy will come from the wind when its windy and the utility becomes your backup source
3586349 in an event that the homeowner is not using a lot of power the excess energy is basically makes the meter spin backwards and feeding power back into the grid
3586350 typically these types of turbines require about nine mile an hour winds to start producing power 6 06 once they start spinning they can maintain a level of power output at lower speeds also
3586351 animation of it might take longer to watch than just reading it but a lot happens between the lines as in this early exchange when the narrator argues with his wife about the worth of the krazy glue she just bought
3586352 this is a parting gift from the bush administration to its timber friends
3586353 it flies in the face of the science that says we need to protect more habitat not less
3586354 after almost 20 years of relying on a static regulatory approach which has led to continual inaction and further decline of the owl it is clear we should be using active management to improve the health of our forests and the spotted owl
3586355 unfortunately this designation doubles down on a patently absurd approach
3586356 is fighting hard and remains in serious but stable condition
3586357 what were trying to do is respond to things that were finding and the thing were finding is people are getting creative so we need to be creative in finding solutions
3586358 were trying desperately to set up it systems that alert us to critical things like addresses phone numbers names that sound similar
3586359 weve been testing it we just havent got it fully implemented yet
3586360 if this person de la torre was following safety regulations we would not have these people dead today its a travesty
3586361 i think we need to give this individual a full opportunity to be heard but if hes guilty of what we suspect he needs to feel the weight of the penalty
3586362 niekas negali b ti nuteistas u veiksmus ar neveikim kurie pagal j padarymo metu galiojusius valstyb s statymus arba tarptautin teis nebuvo laikomi nusikaltimais taip pat negali b ti skiriama sunkesn bausm negu ta kuri gal jo b ti taikyta nusikaltimo padarymo metu 2 is straipsnis nekliudo teisti ir nubausti kiekvien asmen u kokius nors veiksmus ar neveikim kurie j padarymo metu pagal civilizuot taut visuotinai pripa intus bendrus teis s principus buvo laikomi nusikaltimais

3586364 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3586365 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
3586366 with its smooth and seamless design and integrated music features rogers customers will be able to rock out in style
3586367 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3586368 i am your nightmare i am the shape in the dark
3586369 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3586370 i am your nightmare i am the shape in the dark
3586371 the door still appears open for a quarter point rate cut by the reserve bank in early september said stephen walters an economist with jpmorgan in sydney
3586372 an even larger spike in wages could have raised concerns about cost push inflation
3586373 the rate of growth in aggregate wages has remained fairly stable despite the increase in inflation
3586374 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
3586375 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
3586376 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
3586377 it just kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest i wanted to go 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad
3586378 the protests are the manifestation of an anger that the peace process doesnt seem to have achieved anything
3586379 the peace process has not addressed the concerns of kashmiris they want to see an end to uncertainty they want a resolution of the kashmir dispute
3586380 the protests are serious and should serve as a wake up call
3586381 firing on protesters speaks of indian double standards in jammu three protesters were killed during several days of curfew but in the muslim kashmir valley six people are martyred on the very first day of a curfew
3586382 after these shooting incidents we have lost whatever love we had for indians
3586383 the rising pro freedom protests will definitely give impetus to the freedom struggle
3586384 what we are seeing is the revival of the separatist movement in kashmir which had been in a dying stage
3586385 firing on unarmed civilians will alienate people further and serve the cause of separatists
3586386 the last couple of years its been a good league but one of the downfalls has been the limited number of games in the season
3586387 so it will be good to have a longer season and i guess that helps australian based players in regards to making the national team as well
3586388 if there are more games there are more chances of making the national team as well
3586389 obviously the league had to land on its feet first we all knew when it started that eight wasnt enough but the league had to establish itself and i think its well and truly grounded now
3586390 its ready for another couple of teams and hopefully they get it right
3586391 hopefully theyre financially viable and all very competitive on the field and if thats the case its great news for the league to get another two teams and make the season a bit longer and more aligned with the european amount of games
3586392 i do support expansion but its just one of those things that if they can only have one team and they make sure its a strong one team then thats great
3586393 because at the end of the day you want to have a product thats a good product
3586394 i think we are definitely in a position to bring one in whether thats the gold coast or wherever it may be i think over time well see the league expand
3586395 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3586396 i am your nightmare i am the shape in the dark
3586397 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
3586398 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3586399 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
3586400 look hes still working through getting his quad strength back from a knee operation thats what can happen you lose a bit of power so well weigh that up
3586401 des is a guy thats got the magic that you look for sometimes and hes got the ability even at 90 per cent to hold his own in the team
3586402 hes trained his backside off to get back and play because he loves playing so you dont deny a guy that he wants to play as many games as he can
3586403 maybe its time i made a decision on where to go with my life
3586404 where am i going what am i doing why am i here and not somewhere else whats wrong with me do i want to do nothing for the rest of my life
3586405 in this review we found that the procurement function at gpss was deficient lacking appropriate separation of duties and effective oversight to ensure compliance with procurement laws and regulation
3586406 we did ask gbb to go back to the court and ask them for mulching machines because they mayors are constantly clearing the sides of the road for safety and whatever reason and our residents dont
3586407 i have come to find that there are some peculiarities at the minimum if not non compliant documents that were submitted as part of the response to the rfp
3586408 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3586409 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be the biggest environmental disaster of all time
3586410 its not going backwards it is actually recognising that we are with nature not against it we have gone working against nature for too long
3586411 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
3586412 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3586413 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
3586414 building asias largest solar power plant is a landmark moment for the renewable energy sector in korea
3586415 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
3586416 o governo quer aprovar o minist rio e o presidente da c mara questiona a forma como o assunto foi encaminhado ent o vamos encontrar outra forma para fazer com o que o legislativo se sinta prestigiado e feliz

3586418 vamos deixar passar essa marola para conversar sobre isso o importante que o di logo foi reaberto
3586419 posso dizer em uma an lise otimista que essa medida provis ria tem baix ssima popularidade
3586420 ela n o apaixonou os l deres da base nem os de oposi o propusemos que seja retirada
3586421 if you think everyones crazy and everyone thinks youre the insane one maybe you should reevaluate
3586422 the most important report youre likely to read this year
3586423 during the recent quarter we continued to make important strides in the processes needed to produce st 246 on a large scale we continue to maintain a line of communication with barda and are now anticipating a smallpox antiviral rfp in addition we have held our initial meeting with the scientific advice working party in europe
3586424 working with this team with respect to the quality safety and efficacy of st 246 will help to achieve a positive outcome and hopefully timely approval in the european union these efforts coupled with gains made in our ability to manufacture this product on a commercial scale give us great confidence that we have the right momentum needed in order to successfully bring st 246 to market
3586425 our relationship with barda extends beyond the rfp process and we continue to make progress in securing research funding from their research and development budget we have multiple grant applications pending and believe there is a substantial likelihood that we will be awarded substantial funding in addition macandrews amp forbes llc which has been a solid partner to siga over the past several years provided us the option to access 8 5 million in capital during the next year if it becomes necessary we have the resources we need to move ahead with our work on st 246 and our other research and development projects
3586426 he who knows does not speak he who speaks does not know
3586427 this is a perfect time to jump out there and put a mark on the marketplace
3586428 devan and i created pendulum studio because we analyzed the marketplace and identified areas within our expertise that are being under served
3586429 by means of a great deal of careful planning and an incredible amount of internal and external support we were able to open our doors for business now its up to us to do all in our power to keep them open
3586430 this is a profession that traditionally the african american community has not been exposed to as a career option
3586431 we need to transform our profession just like we need to transform our community
3586432 loaded the salvaged parts into an old school bus transported everything to our property and began to build a massive addition onto our house we went from a two bedroom one bath house to a six bedroom three bath home
3586433 we dont want to overmedicalize a normal part of human development
3586434 just because you had a traumatic birth doesnt mean youll get ptsd
3586435 i was crying nonstop for six days in the hospital
3586436 i come downtown at least once a weekend i kid mark funkhouser that he needs to come to johnson county as often as i come to missouri
3586437 see all the scar tissue on my back from that campaign

3586447 there is a new hitler in the middle east he is the president of iran he intends to build nuclear weapons and his brazen declarations to kill the jews have been carried on the front pages of the worlds press in 1935 the christians of the world were silent in the 21st century christians are united in their support of israel we will not be silent in our pulpits on our global media networks in our schools and universities and in the halls of congress we will not keep silent the voice of evil will not go uncontested in our generation not on our watch
3586448 my colleague from new york congressman engel and i agree on very little except when it comes to our complete support for nation of israel my presence here today is certainly no surprise i am a christian evangelical and it was just a matter of scheduling but for congressman engel being here today was an act of moral courage
3586449 i have known and loved pastor john hagee for over 25 years there can be no overstating the depth and sincerity of his devotion to israel
3586450 glass building on 42nd street and first avenue in manhattan had become a terrible place to work
3586451 the days of remaining silent in the face of jew haters is over we say never again to the likes of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad never again to hamas terrorists never again to the united nations never again to universities that espouse hatred for israel and never again to endorsements of presidential candidates
3586452 cufi is alive and well stronger than ever and we are not leaving
3586453 israel will be the praise of all the earth the jewish people have given us the bible the prophets and we cannot explain our existence as christians without the jews but the jews can explain their existence without us christians there would be no christianity today without the jews
3586454 why wont lieberman who is married to the daughter of holocaust survivors end his relationship with hagee why in apparent defiance of the mccain campaign does he remain scheduled to headline hagees upcoming summit if lieberman plans to continue touting his moral fiber and independence as his greatest assets he must renounce the hate mongering hagee
3586455 represents a lot of people in this country particularly christians who care about the state of israel
3586456 as you may know there has been an organized and aggressive campaign to convince me to cancel my speech this evening following the political controversy that broke out over pastor hagee and some of the comments he made but the bond i feel with pastor john hagee and each of you including a significant delegation from connecticut is much stronger than that and so i am proud to stand with you here tonight
3586457 throughout too much of the world it seems that israel is condemned for its every move while excuses are invented for every indecency of its enemies
3586458 you name shall no longer be jacob but israel for you have striven with g d and with men and you have prevailed
3586459 the threat from iran lies not just in their arming training and funding terrorists throughout the middle east and the world but even more from the nuclear weapons development program they are clearly pursuing history warns us what can happen when we dont take the threats of such tyrants and terrorists seriously we must not repeat this mistake
3586460 foreign banks and companies dont want to lose the ability to operate in the us and trade with us and so the sanctions in this bill will help economically isolate the regime in teheran
3586461 people who move the world do not believe that it is inevitable they will sit atop the world they lead not because they believe in their greatness but because they believe in a cause that is greater than themselves they see a mission to accomplish a destiny to shape that is precisely what all of you here do you see israel and america under threat and so you stand up for both you stand for israel not because it is easy or because it is popular but because it is right you stand up for israel because you recognize that it is a cause that is just and honorable because it is a cause greater than yourselves
3586462 i am here tonight to show my support for an organization that courageously extols the jewish right to the land of israel
3586463 coming here tonight and participating in this gathering is a kiddush hashem a sanctification of name pastor hagee is truly an ish elokim a man of g d who has no nefarious agenda when it comes to jews and israel we are most grateful for his sincere devotion to eretz yisroel the land of israel and we obligated by hashem g d to show our hakores hatov appreciation to our friends
3586464 there have been a great many misrepresentations and a great deal of confusion sown
3586465 what will i say the next time im asked to endorse a presidential candidate never again
3586466 you are not covering our dark motives you are expressing your dark motives
3586467 we need to be careful that we dont allow belief in the bible to be unacceptable
3586468 breathe in deeply and you can still smell the embers smoldering around pastor hagees public persona
3586469 we do not decide the israelis decide and they alone have the right to make that decision
3586470 i pray that god will continue to bless you with success
3586471 i can only imagine what the bloggers would have to say about moses and miriam

3586483 when we looked at asias macroeconomy early this year we were slightly surprised that there was barely any slowdown compared to the first quarter of 2007
3586484 thats partly attributable to the fact that in the first quarter the us economy had not slowed down as much as expected

3586489 growth is slowing slightly but the main concern is the worsening fiscal situation as subsidies are used to suppress inflation
3586490 at that point a very significant base effect will kick in and in the absence of a sharp surge in oil prices the inflation figures should come down sharply
3586491 we expect the central bank to raise the repo rate at least once more in october and possibly a second time if oil prices firm up to somewhat higher levels than they are today

3586585 venimos de hacer una muy buena carrera en r o cuarto all se ubico en 12 puesto de la final y por tal motivo no haremos pruebas adem s vamos a correr a salta un circuito que me gusta mucho y donde hemos conseguidos excelentes resultados
3586586 maple grove is a beautiful facility and the only bad thing is that the shut down area is a little bumpy but other than that the track is usually fast and they have good air which creates great racing conditions
3586587 the points really dont matter right now because its all going to change when the countdown to 1 begins following the u s nationals were just going to try and keep marching on and winning rounds and try to put this schumacher electric suzuki in the winners circle
3586588 i think its open to interpretation and thats the great thing
3586589 you know if i want to protest something because it offends me thats my right as an american and its also any artists right to say and do whatever they wanna do
3586590 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities
3586591 coming into the race my goal was to keep the lead
3586592 joe foster raced me really clean on the start and i managed to maintain my lead around the 45 minute mark i pitted to hand the car over to andy from there andy did a great job setting fast laps while conserving gas andy had a great race with stanton in the closing stages of the race but managed to keep the lead all the way to the checkered flag big thanks to all the trg guys they work extremely hard and they definitely deserve this one
3586593 we had a good run and we had a great car
3586594 when you roll off here with a good car you dont have to make too many changes you can concentrate on where you want to make your passes and find those spots instead of worrying about just the speed once we got out there i had a good feeling about where we were strong i just had to wait to see the weakness of the guys we were racing you have to be patient here if you just start charging charging charging youll one just slow you and the guy youre racing down and two its never going to be a surprise when you are coming if you hang out jump when you find a weak point thats the way to do it
3586595 scott and andy drove the wheels off the no 41 porsche
3586596 it was truly fantastic driving coupled with an incredibly prepared car the car had no issues and ran the race flawlessly this was a well deserved win for scott and andy and a well deserved win for the entire trg team expect to see trg make many more podium appearances this season
3586597 the no 39 porsche was forced to retire from the race early due to a power steering malfunction it is definitely a weak point on the car and one that needs to be addressed duncan and spencer drove well all weekend and would have been battling with craig and andy at the end
3586598 it was an opportunity to go over to china and do something that has probably not been done in the past go to china and do some comedy

3586601 what the hell would joe mcnally do in a situation like this
3586602 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
3586603 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
3586604 there is purely circumstantial though highly suggestive evidence that might seem to link iraq with last falls anthrax terrorism
3586605 detected an apparent anthrax leak in december 2001 at the height of the anthrax mailings investigation but did not report it
3586606 the political and journalistic establishment suddenly seems united in wanting to attack iraq
3586607 now that we know that the us govt believes that anthrax came from the inside shouldnt cohen be a wee bit curious about what this warning was based on
3586608 theres either a significant amount of money behind this or this is state sponsored or this is stuff that was stolen from the former soviet program
3586609 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab
3586610 this time next year if its going like it is now i would say yeah i am ready to go again
3586611 so i think from the end of next year i will look at it as a year to year basis but body wise i am in pretty good knick so i dont see why i couldnt play 300 games
3586612 i always thought that at 28 i had the chance to come back but the last few years have been trying times
3586613 i always felt that if i didnt have another injury i would get there to 250 games
3586614 a few years ago he was ready to finish but he plays his role and he can see that there is a premiership not far way and that would make you want to keep playing
3586615 the first year against the kangaroos it wasnt really run very well so it stopped the game for 10 15 minutes but i had an absolute ball the second time around i was off the ground within two three minutes by security the crowd enjoyed it and there was no harm
3586616 in the beginning the church was a fellowship of men and women centering on the living christ then the church moved to greece where it became a philosophy then it moved to rome where it became an institution next it moved to europe where it became a culture and finally it moved to america where it became an enterprise
3586617 dear boy what do we know of the idea of the divine and what can our narrow conceptions presume to tell of the supreme being if i called him by a hundred names like a turk i should yet fall short and have said nothing in comparison to the boundlessness of his attributes
3586618 the problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities we need men who can dream of things that never were
3586619 focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a certain poverty of ambition it asks too little of yourself because its only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential
3586620 i count him braver who overcomes his desires than him who overcomes his enemies
3586621 we advise everyone to stay off the ground because you can be evicted and also face heavy fines
3586622 its for the safety of both players and supporters we would say to everyone stay off the ground
3586623 im sure it will happen but to what magnitude im not sure
3586624 its tradition and im sure a lot would remember the jason dunstall days and just run out there
3586625 its not good to read in the paper that three of your coaches are being interviewed for other jobs
3586626 i could hear him choke tear my head all the skin part in my arms the whole muscle here she told the
3586627 and he kind of threw me upside down and broke my ribs
3586628 all i could do is just scream as hard as i can
3586629 he ended up pawing it open and made himself dinner

3586632 we have to contain our garbage so it will not attract bears

3586683 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3586684 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3586685 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3586686 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3586687 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3586688 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3586689 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3586690 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3586691 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3586692 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3586693 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3586694 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3586695 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3586696 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3586697 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3586698 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3586699 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3586700 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3586701 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3586702 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3586703 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3586704 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3586705 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3586706 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3586707 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3586708 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3586709 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3586710 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3586711 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3586712 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3586713 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3586714 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3586715 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3586716 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3586717 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3586718 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3586719 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3586720 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3586721 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3586722 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3586723 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3586724 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3586725 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3586726 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3586727 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3586728 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3586729 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3586730 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3586731 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3586732 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3586733 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3586734 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3586735 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3586736 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3586737 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3586738 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3586739 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3586740 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3586741 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3586742 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3586743 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3586744 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3586745 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3586746 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3586747 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3586748 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3586749 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3586750 who are open to doing something on the production side
3586751 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3586752 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3586753 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3586754 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3586755 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3586756 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3586757 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3586758 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3586759 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3586760 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3586761 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3586762 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3586763 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3586764 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3586765 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3586766 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3586767 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3586768 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3586769 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3586770 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3586771 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3586772 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3586773 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3586774 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3586775 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3586776 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3586777 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3586778 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3586779 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3586780 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3586781 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3586782 this is a parting gift from the bush administration to its timber friends
3586783 it flies in the face of the science that says we need to protect more habitat not less
3586784 after almost 20 years of relying on a static regulatory approach which has led to continual inaction and further decline of the owl it is clear we should be using active management to improve the health of our forests and the spotted owl

3586791 another round of notable thunderstorms is expected between 2 pm and 8 pm this afternoon with half inch or slightly larger hail gusty northwest winds to 45 mph lightning strikes and brief heavy rains that may produce a very short period of poor drainage flooding in a couple of localities
3586792 but there has clearly been an increase in the incidence of extreme precipitation of one inch of rain or more
3586793 and yes heavier precipitation is in indicator of climate change
3586794 i dont think any responsible climate scientist is saying this weather is caused definitely by climate change
3586795 first it was absurdly low and now its absurdly high
3586796 i thought for sure if anybody got hurt it was going to be karl
3586797 but i think he just took as much as he could
3586798 i think i probably should go with the public defender to begin with is that possible
3586799 i know karl was very depressed over the whole situation

3586829 we advise everyone to stay off the ground because you can be evicted and also face heavy fines
3586830 its for the safety of both players and supporters we would say to everyone stay off the ground
3586831 im sure it will happen but to what magnitude im not sure
3586832 its tradition and im sure a lot would remember the jason dunstall days and just run out there
3586833 im pretty sure that at least half the cheer squad would jump the fence and run out
3586834 because i run it ive got to try and do security in the cheer squad but in saying that i cant hold everybody back
3586835 conditions involving everyones safety including people who run on the ground is an issue so we would be encouraging people not to do it
3586836 obviously we have to make plans in case some people decide to do it
3586837 one would hope people wouldnt jump the fence and be silly
3586838 there is a substantial fine if people enter the playing arena hopefully the public will respect the security presence because you dont want any of them to be hurt or any of the players
3586839 but if a few do jump the fence we will go into a security and police procedure just to make sure the players and officials are safe on the oval

3586880 choosing newcomers based on knowledge of our labour market and experience within canadian society would make canada a more attractive destination for skilled individuals from around the world
3586881 international students and skilled workers would be more likely to choose canada if they knew their time in canada and contribution to canadian society would assist in their eligibility to apply to stay permanently

3586883 whether you have a managerial or professional kind of job white collar kind of jobs or you have blue collar jobs construction worker farm workers chefs you should have equal opportunity to stay in canada
3586884 if they are good enough to live here they should be good enough to stay in canada
3586885 then those who feared and loved the lord spoke often of him to each other
3586886 in that day when i make up my jewels and i will spare them as a man spares an obedient and dutiful son
3586887 then those who reverence the lord talked with each other and the lord listened and heard
3586888 in the day when i make up my treasured possession i will spare them just as in compassion a man spares his son who serves him and you will again see the distinction between the righteous and the wicked between those who serve god and those who do not
3586889 the minister of immigration is seeking continued detention on the grounds he poses a danger to the public he is wanted in italy as the head of a major crime group that terrorized the fishing industry on the coast and created a narcotic trafficking organization
3586890 you have deeply harmed and affected the lives of many individuals and you have been convicted outside of canada with offences involving violence and weapons and several counts of extortion there will be continued detention on the grounds that you are a flight risk and you have the ability to avoid authorities for long periods of time
3586891 people have been working for years to undermine any human progress which contradicts cherished myths since the myth they want to enforce cannot stand on its own merit the only method left for them is to try to discredit any human progress which contradicts the myth
3586892 i also once learned that most other ecclesiastical scholars of the benighted dark ages had refuted aristotles notion of a spherical earth and had depicted our home as a flat or at most a gently curved plate didnt we all hear the legend of columbus at salamanca trying to convince the learned clerics that he would reach the indies and not fall off the ultimate edge
3586893 the supposed dark and medieval consensus for a flat earth is entirely mythological the invention of this fable is traced to the nineteenth century the nineteenth century invention of the flat earth occurred to support another dubious and harmful separation wedded to another legend of historical progress the supposed warfare between science and religion classical scholars of course had no doubt about the earths sphericity our planets roundness was central to aristotles cosmology and was assumed in eratosthenes measurement of the earths circumference in the third century b c the flat earth myth argues that this knowledge was then lost when ecclesiastical darkness settled over europe for a thousand years of middle time almost all scholars held that the earth must be flat
3586894 clearly presented his classical conception of the earth as a sphere at the hub of the cosmos bede then explicitly stated that he meant a three dimensional sphere not a flat plate
3586895 the inspirational schoolchild version of the myth centers upon columbus who supposedly overcame the calumny of assembled clerics at salamanca to win a chance from ferdinand and isabella
3586896 a simplistic picture of history as continual warfare between science and theology exposure of the flat earth myth should teach us the fallacy of such a view and help us to recognize the complexity of interaction between these institutions irrationality and dogmatism are always the enemies of science but they are no true friends of religion either scientific knowledge has always been helpful to more generous views of religion as preservation by ecclesiastical scholars of classical knowledge about the earths shape aided religions need for accurate calendars for example
3586897 people have been working for years to undermine any human progress which contradicts cherished myths since the myth they want to enforce cannot stand on its own merit the only method left for them is to try to discredit any human progress which contradicts the myth

3586932 theres a certain point in your life when you get tired of chasing everyone amp trying to fix everything but its not giving up its realizing you dont need certain people and the drama they bring
3586933 something has to be right about us being together because if it wasnt i dont think i would feel the way i do when you kiss me
3586934 i need someone who can keep up with me i want someone aggressive who pushes me to my breaking point where i just wanna scream someone who will tell me that im not always right and that sometimes i have to apologize for what i do wrong i need someone whos gonna set me straight because no one has ever cared enough about me to try

3586947 remember lee the only thing youve got going for you as a human being is your ability to reason and your common sense if you dont know a dip of horseshit from a dip of vanilla ice cream youll never make it

3586949 for me it means a lot i put that on curb to be recycled i dont want it to get thrown away
3586950 its a lot easier just to throw it all into one container rather than sorting it all and putting it in a separate bag
3586951 thats not to say there arent clean loads coming from single stream facilities or they dont get dirty loads from other facilities but they generally have seen an increase
3586952 it really boils down to what you want out of your program and what s your overall objective
3586953 if youre overall objective is to reduce the cost generally speaking the single stream is going to be less if youre aim to recycle as many materials as you can and recycle it to the highest and best use then the dual stream would win out

3586970 then they start talking about wmd and they say to these iraqi intelligence officers that our president is in trouble
3586971 but the guys were thinking this is absurd because anything put down would not pass the smell test and could be shown to be not of iraqi origin and not using iraqi methodology
3586972 george bush is in trouble our people did not find any wmd in iraq can you help us

3587011 hawaii state law hrs 338 18 prevents disclosure of information contained in vital statistics records except to those people who have a direct and tangible interest in the record as defined by statute
3587012 the embossed seal in question is she said probably on the back of the document provided to daily kos but not visible as in another certificate posted on israel insider for contrast she thinks the difference in visibility can be attributed to the pressure used when applying the seal

3587065 net broadband additions in the quarter were the fewest of any quarter in the seven years lrg has been tracking the industry
3587066 while the relative number of quarterly broadband adds has certainly peaked the decline in additions this quarter compared to the same period last year was exacerbated by verizon and at amp ts emphasis on selling higher speed fios and u verse bundled services often at the expense of the traditional dsl service

3587088 were extremely pleased with the way the charter communications chevrolet has been running
3587089 when we first came back at atlanta and a few races after that it was a brand new car and you always have new car bugs to work out
3587090 when we came back our goal was to win as many rounds as we could and as many races as we could for charter communications lifelock and chevrolet to be honest after sitting out the first three months and missing the first five races i was just so excited to have a ride again and be back out there racing that i wasnt too concerned if we made the countdown if luck was on our side and we performed well enough to get into the top 10 then that was icing on the cake it looks like now that could be the case if we can put a string of races together like we did last year then when they reset these points we might have a shot at the powerade championship and that would be awesome
3587091 ive always raced the same way whether its a wednesday night street car meet at a local drag strip or the u s nationals youre out there to win and thats the way our team is
3587092 we want to win every round possible thats what is so good about this team i know it doesnt matter where we are were there to give it 100 percent and theyll give me the best car possible its my job to do well behind the wheel thats part of being a team with the same goal in mind winning as many races as we can
3587093 we had the same team that we won eight races with last year the same group of guys the same engine program and everything else
3587094 even though we missed five races i felt we could hit the ground running and make a push to get into the top 10 for the countdown
3587095 were trying to get back into the thick of things and we have built for ourselves a little cushion to stay in that top 10 we didnt have enough for kurt johnson in the finals at brainerd but we were making great runs and i was driving good we might be a touch down on horsepower right now but im pretty confident that by the countdown we can solve that problem and run with the top dogs
3587096 last years reading race is still fresh in my mind because it was wednesday before we finished and we ran kurt johnson in the finals
3587097 we ran him again this last weekend in the finals at brainerd were excited to get back to reading for some reason until last year we never had too much luck there but its always been one of my favorite tracks i like the layout and its the home of bill jenkins when my pro stock career first started that was the first time we ever put jenkins horsepower under the hood of our chevrolet and we got to make some runs before we went to chicago in 2003 i have some good memories of that track
3587098 you want to have your best engines in and youre a game on weve had a lot of success there the last two years with the win and the runner up that trophy last year is one im pretty proud of when my career is over i can look back and say that i won the u s nationals thats pretty cool well do some testing after reading and try some things that will help performance wise with the western swing and the back to back races at englishtown and norwalk and the truck being away from the shop we really havent done any testing well have the opportunity to try a long list of things and see if any pan out for us every thousandth counts right now and as youve seen in the last few races the driver has to be on and the crew has to make good runs every round and even then thats not enough being back at the shop and having a weekend off before indy will certainly help us

3587108 we support full inclusion of gay and lesbian families in the life of our nation and seek equal responsibilities benefits and protections for these families
3587109 we support the full inclusion of all families in the life of our nation and support equal responsibility benefits and protections
3587110 if the story is about four words being missing it would not be reporting that millions of our lives are included in this document
3587111 democrats will fight to end discrimination based on race sex ethnicity national origin language religion sexual orientation gender identity age and disability in every corner of our country because thats the america we believe in
3587112 we support the full inclusion of all families including same sex couples in the life of our nation and support equal responsibility benefits and protections we will enact a comprehensive bipartisan employment non discrimination act we oppose the defense of marriage act and all attempts to use this issue to divide us
3587113 we will pass the local law enforcement hate crimes prevention act because hate crimes desecrate sacred spaces and belittle all good people
3587114 we will also put national security above divisive politics more than 10 000 service men and women have been discharged on the basis of sexual orientation since the dont ask dont tell policy was implemented at a cost of over 360 million many of those forced out had special skills in high demand such as translators engineers and pilots at a time when the military is having a tough time recruiting and retaining troops it is wrong to deny our country the service of brave qualified people we support the repeal of dont ask dont tell and the implementation of policies to allow qualified men and women to serve openly regardless of sexual orientation

3587122 its representative of the challenges various communities across the nation are facing with competition for water resources
3587123 no one in the democratic party would want to be publicly associated with him
3587124 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
3587125 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3587126 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3587127 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3587128 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way
3587129 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
3587130 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom
3587131 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway i mean im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3587132 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3587133 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3587134 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3587135 now we are protecting both the tourists and the ancient monuments
3587136 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3587137 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3587138 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3587139 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3587140 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3587141 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3587142 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3587143 but there are things that bring good colors here in alaska
3587144 i love going up in the mountains in september here to see the yellows of the willows and the orange of the blueberries and the red of the bearberries and the purpley fireweed
3587145 one of the things that is really critical is cool nights
3587146 starting in september if it starts to get cool but not below freezing if you have clear cool days and cool nights it stimulates fall color
3587147 then comes marriage then comes a keyboard in a baby carriage
3587148 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3587149 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3587150 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3587151 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3587167 can you cover the big stories that really mean something to people how taxes are spent projections for jobs stuff you just need to know if you live here if you have too few journalists
3587168 thats a concern i have now as a journalist and as a citizen of new jersey
3587169 new jersey was a very strong real estate economy but it soured it is much more serious in new jersey than in any of the other markets that we are publishing in
3587170 those papers arent surrounded by water which believe me helps newsday a lot
3587171 it sort of insulates the long island market and newsday owns long island new jersey in the overall market is one of the most highly competitive markets in the country if you look at a map and see how many daily newspapers are in that part of new jersey its astounding
3587172 guidelines for the classification of films and computer games 2005

3587174 were sneaking into territory they have been working in for weeks and months
3587175 theyll start them out just like you do your tomato plants at home little 2 3 inchers as soon as the weather starts to break the final product here is 1500 per plant
3587176 they go out of their way and find some of the most unbelievable locations weve seen them grow on the side of a cliff where you would swear a mountain goat couldnt get to
3587177 we both agreed that it is not the wave of the future
3587178 that will have a big impact on what the value of the games will be
3587179 the ioc gave us an assurance it would be an open process we made it clear we love the olympics its a great brand but its got to be on reasonable terms the amount that was paid for the vancouver olympics was probably an aberration because it was a home team olympics
3587180 at least 1 7 billion all currency u s in revenue from tv advertising and sales of ge industrial products that have been incorporated into olympic venues
3587181 against the best teams of the world it doesnt work
3587182 if you play against teams that are maybe tactically naive who are in their infancy k that will work for a period of time
3587183 but against the best in the world the likes of sweden the united states norway germany and brazil thats not going to work
3587184 i dont for a second believe that the canadians arent good enough to play a possession style of football
3587185 it all comes down to the philosophy of football theyre being coached to play
3587186 kebangkitan gerakan mahasiswa islam sudah tiba masanya dan kita sendiri sudah tidak sabar untuk mempamerkan wajah kita yang sebenar menawan kampus bermakna kita menawan negara tarbiah yang kita terapkan selama ini sudah meraung raung untuk dilepaskan dalam bentuk yang lebih kental lalu jiwa jiwa dan hati hati kecil kita bagaikan soldadu yang sedia menerima arahan untuk bertindak ya kebangkitan ini diumpamakan tiupan angin lembut yang tiba tiba meruap ganas ditiup gunung gunung tercabut diterpa lautan lautan bergelora
3587187 kalau seorang muslim hendak membanggakan dirinya maka dia semestinya berbangga dengan pelbagai cubaan dan penderitaan yang dialami di jalan islam dia mesti bangga dengan jerih payah perjuangan dan kerja keras yang dia persembahkan untuk agama ini dan dia mesti bangga tatkala di berjuang dengan penuh pengorbanan untuk meninggikan kalimah la ilaha illallah
3587188 inilah kelemahan para daie dan ilmuwan hari ini bagiku gagal untuk melihat bahawa kuasa dakwah pada hari ini kekadang banyak wujud dalam kuasa multimedia dan perfileman lihat sahaja berapa ramai yang tak pernah terlintas mahu membaca sumber sumber islam tapi akhirn ya masuk islam selepas melihat filem the messenger berapa ramai yang sebelum ini keras hati tetapi akhirnya menitiskan air mata apabila melihat 8 siri filem perjuangan ashabul kahfi
3587189 is it weird sitting below a sign that says hometown heroes
3587190 you know i always tell folks i never dreamed i was going to be an astronaut i held those guys in such high esteem i just wanted to fly airplanes
3587191 my last flight i think was probably the most special because we got to put the first two pieces of the space station together and go inside for the first time and power up the lights and turn on the computer and that was pretty neat
3587192 a normal meal we eat in space its just packaged differently some of its freeze dried
3587193 how do people in the space shuttle go to the bathroom because everything floats
3587194 i mean you can imagine you cant just flush it you cant have water flushing waste away
3587195 nasa you will complete the international space station you will stop flying the shuttle you will build a new vehicle you will explore
3587196 that will take crews to the space station and eventually onto the moon
3587197 establishing lunar bases not for two or three days but for months at a time and learning what we can learn so we can go to mars
3587198 most mortgages made between the fall of 2004 and the fall of 2007 the majority of them are underwater
3587199 there are 9 6 million homeowners underwater and most of them are those that bought from the end of 2004 through the end of 2007 in places like california and florida and nevada
3587200 what the current housing market needs is more sales more transactions and a return to liquidity with normal moving and mobility
3587201 this coupled with continued low new construction will reduce the inventory of unsold units and allow prices to stabilize and then recover
3587202 in the sports world everyone tends to price things differently
3587203 theres always a lot that goes into the final price tag of these venues
3587204 it is a jihad because this individual should not be given the chance to destroy the countrys political stability and prosperity
3587205 we hope there wont be elements of slander and empty promises it will be a campaign of good valuesbecause our intentions are pure said ms shahrizat the former cabinet minister had lost her seat in parliament to anwars daughter nurul izzah in march
3587206 the commitment date we have made to the administration and congress has been march 2015 and that hasnt changed
3587207 without as much information as we have today we were attempting to close the gap between shuttle retirement and the first flight of orion and ares 1 to the absolute minimum and so we were trying to push the project towards a september 2013 date internally
3587208 that was not a commitment in any sense because we knew we had not built into that any contingencies everything would have to go perfect to make that date and would probably have required some additional funding
3587209 now weve changed our planning date from september 2013 date to a september 2014 date

3587220 cada vez que los trovadores hacemos un concierto donde se nota un trabajo de mesa y se ve el desarrollo de intenciones en funci n de una idea crecemos much simo porque es como un signo de madurez como contraparte al peligro del que hablaba antes ese de caer en la trampa de lo impactante y lo r tmico guarachoso como nica v a al xito lo tengo muy de cerca cada noche de jueves en nuestro espacio la tanda donde excelentes trovadores tienen que limitarse a echar mano a lo m s movidito de su repertorio por temor a que la bulla de estos tiempos apurados se los trague lo peor es cuando se empieza a componer en funci n de eso y se entroniza la vertiente como paradigma mayor
3587221 me veo en un subgrupo que juega insistentemente mezclando las sonoridades cubanas con otras que a n resultan medio extra as
3587222 recientemente hice un tema que intenta un poco autodefinirme como buen autorretrato dice m s lo que quisiera ser que lo que realmente soy el verso final es casi una cita de un verso de la trovadora rita del prado esto es un fragmento
3587223 i cannot recommend a site any more than this one
3587224 he is absolute in his justice seeking beautifully informational staunchly analytical and a joy to behold i consider it both a duty and a delight to keep coming back here
3587225 upon only a first and second look i d say you should read everything posted by voice of a native son
3587226 intelligentaindigena has great commentary and interesting links that will always make you leaving the site a little more wiser
3587227 an extraordinary blogger posting on news from around the world for issues dealing with oppression of any kind
3587228 he covers issues of interest to all aboriginal peoples from around the world not just native americans
3587229 i do not feel we should forfeit the traditional rights and privileges of the natives of our islands for a mere thimbleful of votes in congress that we the lovers of hawaii from long association with it should sacrifice our birthright for the greed of alien desires to remain on our shores
3587230 everyday we hear from dentists and patients alike how much they love using ultreo and how they can now smile with confidence
3587231 our new share a smile program allows us to inspire even more smiles by rewarding our key supporters in the dental community and supporting a charity dedicated to helping children
3587232 look this can go two ways i can help you create a site that could help create a whole lot of community buzz around this shop but it would it would be hard work and probably time away from shop customers to keep in interesting or we could have a site that was more like a brochure simple facts store hours location and pictures
3587233 we both agreed that it is not the wave of the future
3587234 that will have a big impact on what the value of the games will be
3587235 the ioc gave us an assurance it would be an open process we made it clear we love the olympics its a great brand but its got to be on reasonable terms the amount that was paid for the vancouver olympics was probably an aberration because it was a home team olympics
3587236 at least 1 7 billion all currency u s in revenue from tv advertising and sales of ge industrial products that have been incorporated into olympic venues
3587237 against the best teams of the world it doesnt work
3587238 if you play against teams that are maybe tactically naive who are in their infancy k that will work for a period of time
3587239 but against the best in the world the likes of sweden the united states norway germany and brazil thats not going to work
3587240 i dont for a second believe that the canadians arent good enough to play a possession style of football
3587241 it all comes down to the philosophy of football theyre being coached to play
3587242 there is very little evidence to support the idea that a punitive approach that targets parents is going to increase school attendance especially when were talking about the profile of many aboriginal communities where there isnt enough money being spent on providing basic education services or infrastructure
3587243 by simply saying were going to punish the parents it takes responsibility away from the government to provide enough teachers enough funding to support education services to all of the students in the community
3587244 less than half the funding going towards the education of an aboriginal child compared to a non aboriginal child
3587245 of course of course we needed a hip hop song about not wanting to wake up in the morning and we always wanted to hear someone rap about the evils of consumerism gone bad we needed a song about escaping from a prison planet run by giant bugs why hasnt anyone else written a short song about not wanting to help your friends move hell theres even one song about a parade not happening on his new album of course

3587255 i think pro stocks first year back i think weve been more than successful i think weve had a great number of teams in and out i would have liked to see a little more involvement with the pass people on their off weekends if there was a downside that was probably it i thought there would be more interaction than there has been
3587256 no i want to see a lot of cars show up but believe me the guys that weve seen racing weekly and the guys in the pass series if we only had 50 cars it would be a success because the fans are going to see some serious pro stock racing and horsepower and thats what will constitute good racing
3587257 i think its still an open show in a sense but they bring an element of professionalism along with the drivers that race with his tour classy drivers and good drivers its just one portion of the pie so to speak but having pass has always been an important portion
3587258 i often wonder sometimes if we try to make the purse larger than what we need to thats something im learning myself and im sure tom mayberry has rethought it himself over the years too the 100 000 to win big dawg 400 in 2003 showed us that we really didnt have to pay that much money because we didnt get the car count
3587259 i wanted to keep it similar to what we did with the dnk 250 at unity raceway back in 2004 but maybe just a tad better and i wanted to make a statement that the pro stocks are back
3587260 no there will always be pro stock racing here for as long as i own the track
3587261 the pro stocks the super late models whattever you want to call them thats the elite class and people want to come see these guys these guys are the top class of the northeast

3587302 sometimes in life we learn lessons the hard way such was true for me not too long ago when my father was in need of a transplant i quickly learned the importance of organ donation as the statistics regarding it were very frightening it was then that i decided i would take this tragic time and turn it into something positive fusing my two passions together i used music and organ donation to organize several benefit concerts for organ donation awareness at these events i had set up information tables with pamphlets donor cards bracelets and other information i also read a speech about my own experiences and asked for support in my mission to raise awareness earlier this year i decided to make the organization into an official 501 c 3 and tax exempt organization and all of the proceeds go to organizations such as new england organ bank and donate life america as well as to furthering the efforts of our own organization our mission is to create awareness and to start conversations about a topic frequently misunderstood and too easily overlooked our mission is to spread the message spread love and spread life
3587303 i really dont care about the election whatsoever im just gonna vote democrat to cancel your republican vote i think thats pretty funny when you care so much and i really dont give a shit funny that i can just strip you of a say like that isnt it heh okay im gonna go smoke weed peace dude
3587304 sounds something recover into us just the same ego unweave your grades
3587305 thats where nursing staff took these babies and left them to die
3587306 christ hospital and we now know other hospitals and clinics around the country are involved in an abortion procedure called induced labor abortion
3587307 my experience was that they the babies survive as short as a few minutes to once almost as long as an eight hour shift
3587308 to be clear these were living babies who were left out to die and they were issued both birth and death certificates according to illinois state law
3587309 when she told me what she was doing i couldnt bear the thought of this suffering child dying alone
3587310 and so i cradled and rocked him for the forty five minutes that he lived
3587311 was unmoved and actually opposed the born alive infant protection act
3587312 thought that infanticide was acceptable and voted to protect it some people said that barack obama was uninformed or may not have fully understood the implications of this bill but he voted against it three times thats calculated
3587313 as chairman of the health and human services committee in 2003 he stopped the identical wording from being introduced
3587314 why i love the baby of the man who raped me
3587315 every time i look at phoebe i know i made the right decision i never wanted to end my babys life just because of how she came to be
3587316 everyone save for mum thought i should have an abortion
3587317 my dad even made an appointment at the clinic and they showed me the little blob on the scan i presume to convince me that it was just a mass of cells and the whole thing would be over quickly
3587318 anyone my age would want to have a baby rather than an abortion
3587319 i did and i dont regret it for a moment
3587320 having her in my life is such a joy from the first time i held her in my arms i have had this fierce bond with her a connection which started even before she was born she looks like me when i was her age and i feel strongly that she was meant to be a part of our family
3587321 while it was terrifying knowing that i was going to be a mum made me look forward and focus on something else i suppose i have tried to look beyond what happened to the life that was created
3587322 pro life 101 a step by step guide to making your case persuasively
3587323 how should a civil society treat innocent human beings that remind us of a painful event may we kill them so that we can feel better put differently can you think of any other case where having been victimized yourself you can justly turn around and victimize another completely innocent person
3587324 if the unborn is a human being she should not be killed to benefit her mother hardship does not justify homicide hence we are back to the one question that trumps all others in the abortion debate what is the unborn
3587325 it was as if i could hear the echoes of all those people who with the most sympathetic of tones would say well except in cases of rape or who would rather fervently exclaim in disgust especially is cases of rape all these people are out there who dont even know me but are standing in judgment of my life so quick to dismiss it just because of how i was conceived i felt like i was now going to have to justify my own existence

3587330 kita terima hakikat bahawa pas memperjuangkan pembangunan islam dan hakikat ini kita dapat sesuaikan dengan pembangunan negeri kita
3587331 rakan kita dalam dap pula memperjuangkan rakyat keseluruhannya dan ini pakatan merupakan platform bersama
3587332 dan saya rasa ucapan tuan guru abdul hadi itu menegaskan perlunya masyarakat malaysia menerima perjuangan mereka untuk memperjuangkan agama islam dan ummah sebagai salah satu perjuangan yang tidak boleh ditolak ansur
3587333 itu satu kenyataan dalam pakatan ini saya fikir dalam musyawarah mesyuarat sudah tentu ada tolak ansur dan sebagainya apa pun dasar dasar pas itu perlu dipertahankan
3587334 dan saya fikir untuk membawa dasar seperti itu tentang ahli ahli pakatan yang lain patut dihormati pendapat masing masing dalam penghormatan itulah saya fikir kita dapat satu kesepaduan terhadap sesuatu matlamat yang kita perjuangkan

3587337 some have specific provisions on dates for the submission of accounts for audit to which they are meeting them satisfactorily while others have not shown any improvements since they were last reported on to parliament
3587338 a qualified audit report or opinion is issued when the overall financial statements are fairly stated but that either the financial data indicated a failure to follow applicable accounting standards or there was a significant uncertainty concerning certain financial data
3587339 an unqualified audit report or opinion is issued on the financial statements when there is no material misstatement and all accounting standards are being complied with

3587350 if i had ten spears in my possession i would throw one of them at the romans and i would throw the other nine at these tyrannical fatimids
3587351 if a man has ten spears then he should throw nine of them at you then he should throw the tenth one at you as well
3587352 because you changed the religion of the ummah and you killed the righteous people and you put out the divine light of guidance and you usurped that which did not belong to you
3587353 now has come the time for us to attack them and they will no longer attack us from now on it is we who will march onto them bukhari

3587425 i helped with the valuing nature conference in 2006 and that was a carbon neutral event so i said hey guys lets make this a carbon neutral conference
3587426 it raises awareness of our carbon footprint treecanada ca has this program where you can make your car your house your company or your event carbon neutral
3587427 reg gave me a call and said he was going to be doing this tree planting i work in communications and i thought this would be a good way to let people know about the good things we do here at the canadian forest service
3587428 i was coming over so i said yep ill plant trees its such a different thing that i would normally do ay my job reg said hes an office forester and a lot of the guys are because theres the guys that are in the field and the guys behind the scenes doing the research who dont necessarily make it out into the field like me
3587429 a couple of years ago i was actually interested in planting trees for jd irving
3587430 bobs main hobby was that of a visual artist which was mainly self taught and principally in the media of oil colours
3587431 he primarily expressed his interest in the sea and in boats which came from his boyhood experience growing up in fortune bay even up to his recent illness he was a prolific producer of paintings particularly of grand bank schooners and other seascapes
3587432 he was an interesting individual and if you ever really got engaged in a conversation with him you soon realized there was so much more to him than what met the eye
3587433 i think he was an understated individual who was very talented but chose to keep those talents to himself for the most part
3587434 he would be able to fly there from memory without the use of a gps and just fly over those areas to have a look
3587435 he always had this stern look but once you got to know him that wasnt him he was kind fun and had a really good sense of humour he loved to tell a story and share a story and to be with friends
3587436 we went into the hospital there must have been about 10 of us
3587437 he wanted to sing a few irish songs and one of the ones he wanted us to sing was
3587438 i met him 40 years ago and hes been a true blue friend ever since
3587439 he was quiet actually he was shy when i first met him he kind of shied away from people
3587440 he was hard to get to know hed give you the impression he was a really surly fellow but he was a real softy
3587441 one theme he constantly reminded us of was that life is like a book
3587442 were all kind of based in ontario primarily out of toronto
3587443 buttonville which is an airport in toronto has a flying club a lot of the core members here are from that group
3587444 then there are also just members of the canadian owners and pilots association
3587445 so we dont want to whats called pushing the weather we may park our planes and drive into st johns
3587446 its a bunch of pilots fellowship all that good stuff
3587447 the flying is neat but its incidental to the people you meet
3587448 i feel it is my sacred duty to keep the stalwart young men of today out of a barbarous war 3 5000 miles away in which we have no vital interest
3587449 the atomic bomb had nothing to do with the end of the war at all
3587450 to do what i could to further governor wilsons fortunes
3587451 wilson and house were willing to bargain territories and populations for the particular peace they wanted
3587452 while the president dreamed of saving the world house was beginning to contemplate the implications for the american state of being a world power in this activity between 1915 and 1917 it is not fanciful to see a first sketchy draft of what would become the national security state
3587453 in spite of all he was doing a break with germany could not be averted but only deferred
3587454 no official role in the campaign yet he planned its structure set its tone guided its finance chose speakers tactics and strategy and not least handled the campaigns greatest asset and greatest potential liability its brilliant but temperamental candidate
3587455 i began with him before he became president and i have never relaxed my efforts at every turn i have stirred his ambition to become the great liberal leader of the world
3587456 believe that the war had been imposed on the peoples of europe by the monarchies and their aristocracies
3587457 the statesmen have made a peace that renders another war inevitable
3587458 to act in his place and with his full confidence
3587459 their friendship never recovered from the events of february and march 1919 it ended in bitterness and mutual incomprehension with grave consequences for both of them and ultimately it really is no exaggeration to say for the peace of the world
3587460 wilsons entourage consisting of his wife edith his personal physician admiral cary t grayson his press secretary ray stannard baker and the kingmaker bernard baruch then and for the rest of their lives interpreted houses entirely intelligible and honorable diplomatic maneuvers as the blackest treason
3587461 is my second personality he is my independent self his thoughts and mine are one
3587462 esperanza de que esos acuerdos ayuden a los sobrevivientes y a sus familiares a curar las heridas
3587463 debemos asegurar que hacemos todo lo que est a nuestro alcance por garantizar la seguridad de los ni os bajo nuestro cuidado
3587464 s me lo recomendaron ojal hubiese acatado esa recomendaci n
3587465 agradezco haber sobrevivido a todo esto no cre que podr a hacerlo
3587466 it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a cease fire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3587467 subsequent statements have been a reflection of events on the ground
3587468 theres no question the one relative strength mccain has in the polls is on national security so every chance he gets every way he gets he tries to turn the conversation in that direction
3587469 if anybody were paying attention it might help mccain marginally
3587470 who are absorbed with our own war with our own economic crisis
3587471 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term consequences
3587472 i wholeheartedly condemn the violation of georgias sovereignty i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this arms conflict georgias territorial integrity needs to be preserved and now is the time for direct talks
3587473 the restraint on both sides argument is not very smart its true on one level but its not the right thing to say first
3587474 i dont think it necessarily hurts obama but i think mccain has been vindicated
3587475 i heard they use the r word in the movie thats not right at all
3587476 there were scenes in it that were very derogatory and negative towards people with intellectual disabilities
3587477 i think we were clear about what our intention was in the movie and where the humor was coming from and i feel like thats clear in the context of the movie
3587478 i have seen them slide down in their chairs i have seen them get tears they know what that word means
3587479 labeling and humiliating others is unacceptable in this day and age
3587480 tropic thunder is an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities
3587481 we have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future however no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3587482 we have a double whammy today with both heavyweight sectors under pressure
3587483 we had commodity prices down overnight so the resources sector has been hit very hard and the financials are also down
3587484 when it was painted bright pink it was totally unacceptable
3587485 its not the councils job to deliberately offend people and by leaving it there we would deliberately offend people
3587486 this takes us back to the beginning of the last century when public artworks were censored back in britain at the beginning of modern sculpture
3587487 i feel its insulting to women to remove a vulva because of somebodys attitude
3587488 some of these so called civic leaders are a little immature themselves looking at the female creative power i guess its a very deep rooted ancient fear that men have women are able to reproduce
3587489 we will continue to argue for fuelwatch well wait and see what happens
3587490 i mean nick xenophon with due respect hasnt yet been sworn in as a senator hasnt yet sat there in the senate
3587491 there are unintended consequences it could kill independent operators in terms of wiping them out and it will consolidate the big oil players senator xenophon told abc radio today
3587492 were still wanting to understand how it wont push petrol prices
3587493 it was always going to be the case with fuelwatch and im particularly unsurprised about the comments from mr xenophon this morning
3587494 of course in the lead up to the vote in the senate we will be taking senator xenophon up on his offer of discussion and if theres anything he can propose that meets his concerns while meeting the fundamental policy aims of the government to get more transparency in the petrol market and get rid of what is effectively collusion in the market we will be happy to talk that through
3587495 youre dealing with the majors theyre big bureaucracies theyre slow
3587496 yes theyve got enormous power but a quick nimble independent can work around them
3587497 it may lead to higher fuel prices it will reduce competition and it is a mistake to lock in petrol prices 24 hours beforehand
3587498 the victim had been with friends at his home celebrating an associates birthday
3587499 present at the family home were the victims mother father and other family members
3587500 there has been a lot of talk in this trial about anti muslim sentiment and anti muslim feeling in the community justice bongiorno said
3587501 prejudice sympathy and such things have no part in a criminal trial
3587502 it is important that you determine the case on the evidence you have heard not on any other idea or comment you may have heard justice bongiorno said
3587503 it is important that you dont do any research of your own
3587504 i hate seeing guys like kenny back there in the middle of the post
3587505 i truly believe that he is going to be a special one athletically kenny is without a doubt one of the best ive seen the kid has unbelievable range he can get from the middle of the field to the sideline just like that
3587506 its very intimidating to see him back there because you see this young man can get from the middle of the field to the sidelines
3587507 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3587508 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3587509 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3587510 it was the most pitches i ve thrown i felt pretty good life on the ball and good movement
3587511 a dream sequence has bart playing match game 2034 where bart sits next to
3587512 i dont want to deal with this so ill just rely on someone else to do so
3587513 i know all about the class graph and i want sign in before you can post messages
3587514 i dont want to deal with this so ill gt just rely on someone else to do so
3587515 i know all about the class graph and i want gt this class to deal with it for me
3587516 i dont want to deal with this so ill gt gt just rely on someone else to do so
3587517 i know all about the class graph and i want gt gt this class to deal with it for me
3587518 the frozen conflict in south ossetia has always been a worry for foreign investors in georgia and if that is ultimately removed as a result of this it could become more appealing
3587519 if there is a final conclusion then the slowdown may not be that pronounced but there will be one
3587520 der verband hat in seiner panik eine berhastete entscheidung getroffen
3587521 the print had only been projected once before and it was in excellent shape
3587522 we did a wet gate transfer from the film element and it looks amazing the colors really pop and it looks like the movie is brand new
3587523 it cuts to scenes he talks about and is just one of the greatest insights into the shoot and scoot days of 70s porn ive ever seen
3587524 i cannot remember another title of this stature from the golden era that has never been released even on vhs
3587525 cecil howards command video titles come to mind but even they have all been available on vhs for many years

3587530 our fight is simply to protect our clients intellectual property rights for the day that they may be allowed to sell their product when and if that happens is not our issue
3587531 i never encountered him advocating for lifting the embargo or travel restrictions
3587532 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
3587533 moderation in growth by itself isnt likely to bring down inflation dramatically
3587534 it should help to alleviate some of the inflation concerns and inflation pressures that we had been confronting assuming this sticks
3587535 substantial uncertainty remains about the ultimate size of mortgage losses
3587536 i think itll taken some time for these headwinds to diminish
3587537 in fact i wouldnt be surprised if they didnt pick up a little more momentum first
3587538 the dollar rally has temporarily stalled with players looking to take profit on recent out sized moves
3587539 were taking a pause today on the dollar rally but the trading volumes have been on the lighter side until you see oil go back up to 118 and gold back above 850 i think the dollar is still going to have some strength
3587540 the market has had a pretty good rally in the last few days it got about 8 percent off the lows so theres possibly some profit taking in the banking sector with the lowering of earnings forecasts for goldman sachs
3587541 ich konnte auf den letzten 100 meter nichts mehr sehen weil sich die brille mit wasser gef llt hat

3587546 2gether consulting has a unique insight into the challenges of demonstrating consistent fair treatment of customers our aim with this workshop is to offer useful tips and insights to give firms a head start in overcoming the challenges as well as providing a forum for debate
3587547 you have to talk to people and educate people to expand the possibilities in this field
3587548 you need to go into larger trials for safety and efficacy insmeds limited data appeared to be good data however bioequivalence testing in healthy volunteers does not provide the necessary data on how the biologic actually works in the body which can only be determined through more extensive clinical testing in patients where safety and efficacy are evaluated
3587549 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
3587550 the events of the last five weeks highlight the profound importance of dns to the proper functioning of the internet and the critical role nominum plays in protecting it
3587551 nominum has a strong track record of delivering software that works the first time
3587552 we were able to upgrade our servers and secure our high speed internet service in advance of the threat without any disruption to our customers
3587553 nominum has done its customers and the internet a great service by working so closely with me the carriers and the rest of the dns community on this common threat to the internet and nominum has delivered on the trust placed in it by its customers
3587554 to know that over a hundred and twenty million users are safe within such a short time after the vulnerability was discovered is excellent and nominum
3587555 my promise to our customers has always been the same to consistently provide the industrys highest quality best tasting beef with a commitment to environmentally sound practices humane animal treatment and personal integrity i stand behind this commitment the best way i know by putting my name on everything we sell
3587556 most of the beef was sold at grocers other than whole foods and recalled this summer an additional 1 2 million pounds were recalled on friday by the processor after illnesses in several states were tentatively linked to ground beef sold at whole foods and other stores

3587570 michael waltrip racing is fully committed to our sponsors the success of our race teams and ensuring michael mcdowell david reutimann and i have the necessary tools to succeed as drivers
3587571 weve asked mike skinner to evaluate areas where we can improve our on track performance
3587572 i thought he did a really nice job of working with red bull and a j allmendinger earlier this year and our no 00 champion mortgage team could use the same experienced insight
3587573 we feel the same way about michael mcdowell as we did when we signed him
3587574 but this is the toughest most competitive form of racing in the world and i know michael and mwr can benefit from skinners input
3587575 i support doing whatever it takes to improve the performance of our team
3587576 no driver wants to get out of the car but i understand that every part of our program needs to be evaluated and that certainly includes me i plan to support mike skinner and our team any way i can and hopefully learn some things that will help when i get back in the car
3587577 there was just something about him that made you realize you were talking to a special kid
3587578 the way he dealt with the situation he was in kind of inspired you and broke your heart at the same time
3587579 but he insisted it was such a special gesture and i will always treasure the look on my sons face at that moment
3587580 when he went it took a special piece of me
3587581 im just glad i met him he was a great kid from a great family seeing how close they were and how they dealt with it really touched me
3587582 he told me that medal means more to him than his mls medal
3587583 im going to frame a j s medal next to my mls medal
3587584 and id love to have an olympic medal to take home and put all three of them together
3587585 central banks need to use interest rates to cope with higherinflation on rising imported raw material prices the realeconomy will recover gradually if an interest rate hikestabilises prices

3587587 i feel like a beginner its totally different different gun different pull different everything
3587588 its like a marathon runner switching to hurdles or a swimmer going to diving the similarity is they both use a pool filled with water skeet and double trap are like night and day
3587589 its the most ive ever trained for an olympics ive been averaging 1 000 rounds a day ive also got mental training as far as trying to learn all the leads and pull points a thousand times a day getting the gun from the hip on top of the shoulder

3587593 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3587594 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3587595 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3587596 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3587597 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3587598 we continue to successfully develop our network brands on the internet online advertising revenues were approximately 20 1 million in the second quarter of 2008 compared with 19 3 million in the second quarter of 2007 year to date online advertising revenues were 36 4 million in 2008 compared with 34 7 million in 2007

3587610 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3587611 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3587612 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3587613 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3587614 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3587615 fuck it i just have one last free week and then it will be like it was in puerto rico no time to play except on weekends
3587616 the reward of a thing well done is to have done it
3587617 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3587618 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3587619 it is a sin we both will burn and rot in hell
3587620 i want to go to heaven once before i go to hell
3587621 our aim was to find a player that could make a difference and dictate the tempo of our team
3587622 in the end we managed to bring dan dickau to avellino he is a serious professional with nba experience
3587623 the warrant charges murphy with the kidnapping sexual battery and murder of 6 year old coralrose fullwood
3587624 all of have been saying since day one we were more concerned about getting it right than doing it fast i look you all in the eyes today and say i think weve done it right
3587625 senator dole was genuinely interested in health care reform but wanted to run for president in 1996 he couldnt hand incumbent bill clinton any more legislative victories particularly after bills successes on the budget the brady bill and nafta

3587627 the meat is marinated ahead of time in a mixture of spices and yogurt then baked
3587628 camp is going well for reggie obviously hes talented but he has to work on his technique with most young corners the technique part is what they have to usually focus on when they come into the nfl but he done well so far in the game the other night he made some nice tackles and nice plays on the ball if he continues to work on technique and details he should have a nice year for us
3587629 i dont think willets and hunters point south and coney island are necessarily without precedent
3587630 the model is taking on big projects the scope and magnitude of which havent ever been tackled before by city government
3587631 hooters not translating as a pun in mandarin rachel is unaware that the word emblazoned across her vest refers to something other than the owl that goggles away in its logo as she takes orders beneath a large sign reading
3587632 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3587633 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3587634 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3587635 its awesome go look at my books tonight and yesterday its august and were killin it just killin it spectacular
3587636 a couple of weeks ago we had a vice squad show up
3587637 about 20 cops the building department the state liquor authority the health department the fire department you name it i was horrified they just took over the bar putting flashlights in customers faces it was four days after our
3587638 the lieutenant came up to me and i said listen man this is a
3587639 im way too modest to say that italian is the new french
3587640 it became approachable for the person sitting at home watching tv and saying i can do that i can make fresh pasta like that it just became cool marios a cool guy people wanted to cook like him people wanted to eat like him
3587641 probably second only to batali as new yorks favorite italian chef
3587642 everybody would love to have that restaurant thats 10 years old at this point and theyre still booked a month in advance
3587643 there is such a thing as the peter principle where people rise to their level of incompetence and it just became clear to me that maybe i was associated with a group that was in that category
3587644 mike bloomberg still counts he matters hes somebody that has opinions has thoughts has ideas and when he finds candidates of like mind hes prepared to support them
3587645 for the most part he likes the status quo in albany
3587646 so are anarchists revolutionary do they believe in a revolution
3587647 i hope so to some extent i hope every anarchist has a goal of revolution
3587648 to organize militant direct action that manifests opposition to both the democratic and republican parties
3587649 we already have a transportation plan that has sworn law enforcement officers has department of corrections staff that will be staffing any critical positions along the transportation route
3587650 personally we would have liked to have seen 6 000 cops thats a number that we know that we can take on anything that is thrown at us but well see how it goes
3587651 i think chief harrington has underestimated the ability of anarchists to cause mayhem
3587652 the problem is going to be how many troublemakers come and it doesnt take many to cause a large scale problem

3587697 the question now is what else russia is prepared to do to make up for those 17 years of humiliation one thing we should pretty much count on is that moscow right now is casting an eye toward iran the most direct route to restoring its influence in the middle east an iranian russian alliance moscow knows would be an israeli american nightmare not to mention a major headache for the global economy russia sitting on eurasian oil exports and iran on the strait of hormuz would put 22 million bbl a day under the control of a very unfriendly alliance will moscow try to team up with tehran

3587712 examine for yourself the cultural connotations of associating one whose husband has died with one who places her body on the open market for the sexual gratification of others a woman is simply assumed to nay damned to be of little virtue and possess no moral compass whatsoever in the absence of a man to make sure the woman is good

3587716 the money i save from instituting some of the practices and employing some of the techniques i learned this weekend will more than pay for the costs of attending the conference
3587717 this was my 2nd conference and honestly cant afford to miss it with all the information and trade secrets that are shared among all the participants even after 28 years in the industry i was amazed at how much the trade has evolved with new technology
3587718 it is neat to have a venue where we can get together and learn new things and share with one another and just to get together with other people who understand what we are talking about it is wonderful the classes are very informative they are very concise and to the point and the instructors are always open to questions
3587719 if youre like me you can read till your eyes bleed and listen to it explained till your brain hurts but aint nothin like watching someone else do it
3587720 it was a pleasure being at your conference its reasonable price for everything that was included i learned many new ideas things and was inspired to try them and implement them in my bench work just the entire experience was super wow did i have a great time
3587721 i want to tell you again how much i enjoyed the expo it was a very positive experience and i feel that i brought plenty of ideas and information back to more than justify the time and expense great job
3587722 i had a wonderful time here at the conference most bench jewelers live in our small boxes and this is a chance to get out socialize and meet new people find out what is happening in the industry meet some wonderful vendors just an all round excellent opportunity i think there was a good mix of exhibitors its wonderful to be able to compare products side by side and then be able to verify what the sales people say with so many jewelers in the room with experience in their shops with those products its just a wonderful opportunity to see a good mix of vendors
3587723 the bench conference was an overall good experience with lots of opportunity to network with other jewelers with a vast knowledge and experience the free sharing of information was excellent
3587724 i enjoyed the most that jewelers can all come together and have camaraderie the time we can be together and sit around and talk and iron out problems we may have its neat to have a venue where we can get together and learn new things and share with one another and just to get together with other people who understand what we are talking about it is wonderful the classes are very informative they are very concise and to the point and the instructors are always open to questions
3587725 just a note to say a big thanks for the great conference this weekend i came away with some wonderful ideas and information plus it was nice to be able to talk with others in the trade
3587726 its nice to see someone put on a conference specifically for bench jewelers

3587748 what is called the music business today however is not the business of producing music at some point it became the business of selling cds in plastic cases and that business will soon be over but thats not bad news for music and its certainly not bad news for musicians indeed with all the ways to reach an audience there have never been more opportunities for artists
3587749 to say the least it was most unfortunate that the bmw was travelling at such an excessive speed
3587750 if it had not been i suspect that the deceased may have cleared it the road
3587751 the deceaseds drunken behaviour towards you was unlawful and insulting but in his state of drunkenness it should have been obvious that there was no chance of pursuading him of his misbehaviour still less that he would acknowledge it
3587752 you are like b1 and b2 only f wit 1 and f wit 2
3587753 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it
3587754 i think drivers do have the ability to just turn off emotions because you just have to get in the car and drive and sometimes the less you think the less emotion you have the better
3587755 sometimes the first rounds makes you really nervous and your hearts beating really fast but you cant let that affect your driving
3587756 for a second you think why do i do this then it just kind of reinforces how much you love to drive so you get back in turn off your emotions and just do it i think the more you do it the more you love it and that allows you to do it because you love it regardless of whatever might happen
3587757 im hopeful that more good things are in store for our team

3587764 so enough of the dumb counter there has actually been a lot of cool stuff happening the past few days we had a day off show right outside albany ny and that was a ton of fun there was a local band that opened the show called enigmatic heart and they were probably one of the most promising bands i have seen in awhile the reason being they are all between the ages of 13 and 16 i believe and they are playing music that is better than 80 of whats on say warped tour i got to talk to a few of them for awhile and it was really cool just trying to give as much encouragement as possible they are not bad but considering how young they are they have real potential to do something awesome if they just put their minds to it and think outside the box keep an eye out for them

3587773 skeptics may take a look at the cd cover and dismiss nikkole as just another pretty face without listening to her music that would be a mistake for both women and men it certainly does not hurt to have the looks to go with the talent in the entertainment industry this lady has cracked the commercial radio market and is in heavy demand for gigs because she is a very gifted singer songwriter producer
3587774 nikkole is superb what an amazing talent we at niu fm are pleased to add such a dynamic artist to our program playlist she is destined for stardom
3587775 nikkole has the range and the potential to be the next big hit she has a great old school soul sultry sound and the listeners in this area love nikkole
3587776 did you just say nice tits well your the first in 2 decades thanks
3587777 weve been losing too many games in the seventh inning and later
3587778 i came in and just didnt get the job done
3587779 were getting him checked out were very suspicious hes not right
3587780 hes not right i know that for a fact i dont know if hes hurt but hes not right
3587781 it was a good win because it was a total team effort we battled from the start it something that we havent done in a long time
3587782 i made a couple of mistakes but i was able to make the rest of my pitches
3587783 we got got at bats good pitching and key hits
3587784 the big thing was that i didnt let that first home run bother me
3587785 it was a good pitch that he hit if you let things like that get to you you never get yourself straight
3587786 it can never hurt especially this time of the year
3587787 he was throwing strikes he was a little bit wilder tonight so maybe he needs to just be a little wild it was an outstanding performance from him
3587788 thats big against a guy whos been dealing like that we got on him early
3587789 we took the lead first and i got more confident on the mound
3587790 i felt out of whack it wasnt until the second or third inning that i got more acclimated
3587791 when he got in trouble he threw the ball well
3587792 our opportunities tonight seem to come with two outs when things got dicey he stepped up and made some good pitches
3587793 i used to do that too but you know you cant waitress forever what are you studying in school any way
3587794 dont be a piece of crap when you grow up look
3587795 do you want your eggs over easy or scrambled honey
3587796 well obviously judging by this haircut it looks like youve gone into the wrong field
3587797 you were doing so well at first i thought you were going to be normal and than all of a sudden bam you have to go and insult the goddamn woman like that
3587798 i told her not to cut it short the bitch didnt listen and than she goes and tries to insult me i am a paying customer
3587799 that was fantastic great job on the anthem thank you
3587800 hes taking a better approach at the plate is in a little better shape and helping the team
3587801 i went down and put in a lot of work and that gave me confidence
3587802 it feels good to help the team on offense as well as defense
3587803 you want to send the home fans home with a smile on their faces
3587804 im not pleased after i got two outs i should have closed it right there but i didnt as a result i put my team in a hole
3587805 id certainly like to be on the other end of it
3587806 the game is dictated by your starting pitcher and the ability or the inability to put zeros on the board after you score
3587807 when he gets ahead of the count and makes sure hes around the plate this is the type of game you see from him
3587808 i felt like ive been throwing the ball well the last few starts but a mistake here or there cost me
3587809 today i didnt have any mistakes i feel really strong and healthy and we have only two months left important months too
3587810 he found his changeup again which had kind of been gone for a little while
3587811 he had his normal slider and his slow curveball that he can throw with two strikes he pretty much had four pitches going all night
3587812 the main thing to me is how we play tomorrow
3587813 the last two series we face kansas city we do the same thing we win the first game and all of a sudden we lose the series i hope these guys remember that the way i do
3587814 other than the mistakes that he made for the home runs he pitched much better
3587815 theres not a ton of results right now but i think im getting closer to where i need to be to help this team win a lot more ballgames in the future
3587816 i think this teams built around home run hitters i just hope people are on base when we hit home runs
3587817 there were two balls that definitely should have been caught and we couldnt find the handle
3587818 until you value yourself you wont value your time and until you value your time you will not do anything with it
3587819 the likelihood of having his deficiency is less than one in a million
3587820 he wont have a perfectly normal body but the warts should reduce in size to the point where he could use his hands
3587821 over the course of three to six months the warts should be come smaller and fewer in number he will be living a more normal life
3587822 i would like to bring him to the us to run tests on where his immune condition has come from but i would need funding and to get him a visa as well as someone to cover the costs of the tests
3587823 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings and in cars its impossible to count them now theres hardly a single building left undamaged
3587824 w ashingtons bloody fingerprints are all over the invasion of south ossetia
3587825 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals
3587826 4 2 of gdp more than a quarter of all georgian public income to military hardware
3587827 georgia could have used the years of saakashvilis presidency in different ways to build up the economy to develop the infrastructure to solve social issues both in south ossetia abkhazia and the whole state instead the georgian leadership with president saakashvili undertook consistent steps to increase its military budget from us 30 million to 1 billion georgia was preparing for a military action
3587828 in addition to the spy drones israel has also been supplying georgia with infantry weapons and electronics for artillery systems and has helped upgrade soviet designed su 25 ground attack jets assembled in georgia according to koba liklikadze an independent military expert in tbilisi former israeli generals also serve as advisers to the georgian military
3587829 the conflict has been sparked by the race for control over the pipelines carrying oil and gas out of the caspian region the russians may just bear with the pro us georgian president mikhail saakashvilis ambition to bring his country into nato but they draw a heavy line against his plans and those of western oil companies including israeli firms to route the oil routes from azerbaijan and the gas lines from turkmenistan which transit georgia through turkey instead of hooking them up to russian pipelines jerusalem owns a strong interest in caspian oil and gas pipelines reach the turkish terminal port of ceyhan rather than the russian network intense negotiations are afoot between israel turkey georgia turkmenistan and azarbaijan for pipelines to reach turkey and thence to israels oil terminal at ashkelon and on to its red sea port of eilat from there supertankers can carry the gas and oil to the far east through the indian ocean
3587830 as far as natural resources are concerned russias hand is very strong it holds 6 6 percent of the worlds proven oil reserves and 26 percent of the worlds gas reserves in addition it currently accounts for 12 percent of world oil and 21 of recent world gas production in may 2007 russia was the worlds largest oil and gas producer as for national champions putin has strengthened and prepared gazprom the state controlled gas company transneft oil pipeline monopoly and rosneft the state owned oil giant that is why in 2006 gazprom retained full ownership in the giant shtokman gas field 7 and took a controlling stake in the sakhalin 2 natural gas project in june 2007 it took back bps kovytka gas field and now is behind totals kharyaga oil and gas field
3587831 a new model of cooperation in the energy sector that would allow foreign partners to share in the economic benefits of the project share the management and take on a share of the industrial commercial and financial risks
3587832 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of august 6th
3587833 much of the city tskhinvali was reportedly in flames friday the regional parliament building had burned down the university was on fire and the towns main hospital had been rendered inoperative by the bombardment
3587834 russian soldiers captured group of american mercenaries on territory of south ossetia group was captured near of zare village
3587835 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
3587836 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
3587837 were killed by their own georgian partners in the peacekeeping forces there is a russian battalion an ossetian battalion and a georgian battalion and all of a sudden the georgians georgian peacekeepers begin shooting their russian colleagues this is of course a war crime i do not rule out that the hague and strasbourg courts and institutions in other cities will be involved in investigating these crimes and this inhuman drama that has been played out
3587838 the actions of georgia have led to deaths among them are russian peacekeepers the situation reached the point that georgian peacekeepers have been shooting at russian peacekeepers now women children and old people are dying in south ossetia most of them are citizens of the russian federation as the president of the russian federation i am obligated to protect lives and the dignity of russian citizens wherever they are those responsible for the deaths of our citizens will be punished
3587839 ok one second i just have to take my pants off
3587840 it had big teeth a big head short legs in front and long legs in back i was raised on a ranch and id never seen anything like it
3587841 id rather be in cuero texas looking for a chupacabra
3587842 theres something going on with these animals and whatever it is its going on right here
3587843 if we run across it again then we might have to do something about it

3588073 you know in 20 years from now youll look at something and say this seems familiar and youll be reminded of this day that you were sitting with me on this bench looking out onto this lake and remember how it was a very special thing that we were brought together
3588074 natural affinity of doves and pigeons in how they disassociate themselves from one another in flight
3588075 to love the ugly world is to find yourself at its center and to let it be enough to refuse to be saddened by it to let it end thats where it all started for me at the end
3588076 criait lun de ces bandits aux citoyens rassembl s sur le trottoir alors que ses compatriotes plus loin allumaient feu par dessus feu mena ant les habitations et les commerces voisins

3588089 yang sebaik baik kamu ialah orang yang mempelajari al quran dan mengajarkannya
3588090 suruhlah anak anakmu mengerjakan sembahyang bila sudah berumur 7 tahun dan pukullah marahilah bila dia tidak mengerjakan sembahyang kalau sudah berumur 10 tahun
3588091 orang yang membaca al quran lagi pula ia mahir kelak mendapat tempat dalam syurga bersama sama dengan rasul rasul yang mulia lagi baik dan orang yang membaca al quran tetapi tidak mahir membacanya tertegun tegun dan tampak agak berat lidahnya belum lancar ia akanmendapau dua pahala
3588092 wahai ibnu masud berilah nasehat yang dapat kujadikan obat bagi jiwaku yang sedang gelisah dalam beberapa hari ini aku merasa tidak tenteram jiwaku gelisah dan fikiranku kusut makan tak enak tidur tak nyenyak
3588093 hendaklah kamu beri nur cahaya rumah tanggamu dengan sembahyang dan dengan membaca al quran
3588094 perbanyaklah membaca al quran di rumahmu sesungguhnya di dalam rumah yang tak ada orang membaca al quran akan sedikit sekali dijumapi kebaikan di rumah itu dan akan banyak kejahatan serta penghuninya selalu merasa sempit dan susah
3588095 dan apabila dibacakan al quran maka dengarkanlah baik baik dan perhatikanlah dengan tenang agar kamu mendapat rahmat
3588096 sesungguhnya orang orang yang beriman itu hanyalah mereka yang apabila disebut nama allah gemetarlah hati mereka dan apabila dibacakan kepada mereka ayat ayat nya bertambahlah iman mereka karenanya dan kepada tuhanlah mereka bertawakkal
3588097 apakah aku pula yang membacakan al quran untukmu ya rasulullah padahal al quran itu diturunkan tuhan kepadamu
3588098 aku senang mendengarkan bacaan al quran itu dari orang lain
3588099 maka bagaimanakah halnya orang kafir nanti apabila kami mendatangkan seorang saksi rasul dan nabi dari tiap tiap umat dan kami mendatangkan kamu muhammad sebagai saksi atas mereka itu umatmu
3588100 ya allah bukakanlah kiranya kepada kami hikmat mu dan taburkanlah kepada kami rahmat dan khazanah mu ya allah yang maha pengasih lagi maha penyayang
3588101 sabbihissma rabbikal ala beliau lalu membaca subhanarobbiyal ala diriwayatkan pula oleh abu daud dan wa il binhijr yang maksudnya sebagai berikut
3588102 aku terlambat datang karena mendengarkan bacaan al quran seseorang yang sangat bagus lagimerdu suaranya belum pernah akumendengarkan suara sebagus itu
3588103 by the rivers of babylon there we sat sat and wept as we thought of zion
3588104 when a man really gives up trying to make something out of himself a saint or a converted sinner or a churchman a so called clerical somebody a righteous or unrighteous man when in the fullness of tasks questions success or ill hap experiences and perplexities a man throws himself into the arms of god then he wakes with christ in gethsemane
3588105 39going a little farther he fell with his face to the ground and prayed
3588106 my father if it is possible may this cup be taken from me yet not as i will but as you will
3588107 could you men not keep watch with me for one hour
3588108 watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation the spirit is willing but the body is weak
3588109 my father if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless i drink it may your will be done
3588110 it opens the lungs washes the countenance exercises the eyes and softens down the temper so cry away
3588111 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3588112 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3588113 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3588114 i would have liked to medal but i got my first personal best of the meet and i think thats a good effort
3588115 i cant be upset with that and im just moving on to the next heat
3588116 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
3588117 i thought the portfolio presentation was a bit much for a room over oreillys holy grail
3588118 he was trying too hard to impress me but i wasnt sure why i thought maybe it was because im female
3588119 you can go into a store and steal a loaf of bread and do a year in jail
3588120 but you can steal months of rent from a landlord and never do any time in jail its a great crime to commit because there are no penalties
3588121 at first i thought he was an attorney i had worked with
3588122 it took me a while to remember who he was but thats how he comes across a smooth talking gentleman in a nice blue blazer and khakis like a harvard man
3588123 he told me he was a doctor and that he could get me a job with a real company
3588124 im a gay man so i know a lot of people who work it real hard and i work with recovering addicts who are always looking for an angle i could tell that getzow was a snake
3588125 he was laughing about it like he was doing it out of spite
3588126 it was very strange he takes this joy out of it
3588127 myles had to hire someone to sit in the hallway for up to 10 hours a day waiting for getzow to come out
3588128 im pretty sure the person had waited there for like five days and they knew he was in the room because they could hear the radio and shower
3588129 i evicted him once in 45 days it was a record
3588130 he was a character one time he was being evicted under a different name and when he walked into the courtroom and realized the judge knew him he turned and ran out
3588131 believe it or not a lot of landlords are struggling and they can be in a hurry to fill an empty unit
3588132 and some guy with charisma comes along and the landlord is willing to take a chance
3588133 its very difficult to track something like that but i would say of the 2 000 people we help every year less than 1 percent are trying to take advantage of the system
3588134 in any case its not our role to judge the people who come to us for help tenants have a right to present their case in court
3588135 in fact what we see more of is serial evictors landlords who continually come up with ruses for one eviction after another
3588136 there are lots of tenants who have gotten themselves into a tight spot for one reason or another theyre elderly they have medical conditions lost jobs things that are beyond their control i see it every day and its very very sad
3588137 there can be a series of gotcha moments such as the landlord accepting money from a tenant that can set the whole process back
3588138 theres a morass of litigation that can cause delays and remember the landlord is paying for an attorney the entire time in addition to losing rent
3588139 even after i received a judgment against him for 11 000 which i know ill never see he came up to me in court and vowed to pay me back as though it were all some kind of misunderstanding
3588140 hes ripped off so many people here and he continues to eat and drink and hang out in this neighborhood and we have to watch him
3588141 if he just put the same energy into a profession that he puts into not paying rent and spending time in court he would probably be a very successful man
3588142 siapa yang tidak memperhatikan urusan kaum muslimin maka ia bukan dari golongan mereka
3588143 sungguh semua manusia akan merugi kecuali manusia beriman beramal saleh
3588144 ada dua pengetahuan paling penting dan mendasar bagi setiap muslim marifatullah pengetahuan tentang allah dan marifatunnafs pengetahuan tentang diri sendiri
3588145 visi kita tentang diri kita tentang a sampai z dari ruang kepribadian kita persepsi kita tentang diri kita cara kita melihat dan memandang diri kita yaitu diri kita yang kini ada dan diri kita yang kita inginkan di masa mendatang
3588146 hai orang orang yang beriman bertakwalah kepada allah dan hendaklah setiap jiwa melihat apakah kiranya yang telah ia siapkan untuk hari esoknya sekali lagi bertakwalah kepadanya karena ia mengetahui semua yang kamu lakukan
3588147 orang mukmin yang kuat lebih dicintai allah daripada orang mukmin yang lemah
3588148 kebenaran yang tidak terorganisir akan dikalahkan oleh kebatilan yang terorganisir
3588149 it seemed like a great idea and everyone else thought it was a great idea too
3588150 because of the possibility of the trees falling in high winds
3588151 even if it comes down to a safety issue which it shouldnt cut them off above the tikis and leave the tikis if thats not the issue
3588152 id like to have an arborist thats actually examined a tree with a tiki carved into it for one thing
3588153 mosab hassan yousef is an extraordinary young man with an extraordinary story he was born the son of one of the most read more
3588154 systematic exploitation of chinese workers in plants producing sporting goods for export to official u s olympics sponsors like speedo
3588155 adidas kodak and mcdonalds alone urged the un and international community to address the genocide or took other actions
3588156 will help promote our economic and social progress and will also benefit the further development of our human rights cause
3588157 is it too much to ask the chinese to keep their word
3588158 this is an extraordinary opportunity for conference attendees to engage in an intimate dialogue with leading thinkers
3588159 these sessions will give business leaders pragmatic and specific insights they can bring back to their companies
3588160 okay whats the difference between a premier account and a business account
3588161 today we put the fire out and immediately after that we started trying to cool down the pipeline as soon as the cooling process ends we will begin assessing the damage and start repairs
3588162 the latest scientific research is that the western idea of individual choice is an illusion
3588163 people who think of a professor before taking a test do better than people who think of a criminal
3588164 itu bukti keberhasilan yakeba dalam dedikasinya untuk penanggulangan hiv dan aids kami memaknai ini sebagai penghargaan atas hasil yang dicapai sejak tahuin 1999 yakeba berdiri sebagai pusat informasi hiv aids dan pemberdayaan odha berbasis kesehatan dasar masyarakat

3588166 los inhabilitados son una pila de ladrones que deber an estar presos
3588167 this is his first true challenge at the professional level and we definitely gave him a challenge throwing him in there
3588168 you got to remember we drafted and acquired him as a guy who could pitch late in games
3588169 so theres a very small margin for error when youre pitching late in a game at the big league level
3588170 there is overwhelming evidence of wrongful conduct on the part of the russia federation
3588171 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time
3588172 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3588173 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3588174 russia has much more to lose than the soviet union had to lose in 1968
3588175 russia has one foot in integration into the international economy and community of states and one foot that is not quite in
3588176 russia is going to have to assure its integration into the wto and the oecd and the g8 and institutions like that
3588177 to undermine our relations to curtail our relations we might as well let the united states deal on its own with some of the issues
3588178 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3588179 there is a text it has been accepted in moscow it was accepted here in georgia i have the agreement of all the protagonists
3588180 the murloc speak a dialect of nerglish aka murloc and this plush utters phrases in this language
3588181 our visit is a sign of the solidarity of our five countries with the georgian nation which has been a victim of aggression
3588182 these nations still remember how in 1939 the soviet army crossed into their territory to purportedly defend the rights of ethnic minorities
3588183 in the baltic states and ukraine independence is still seen as something fragile and not necessarily built to last so if its not defended actively it cant last
3588184 people are certainly afraid that russia could attack lithuania just like georgia and you see that kind of view among politicians
3588185 were georgias closest friend in the region weve suffered the same kind of violence
3588186 if military aggression is being justified by the need to protect russian citizens then this should cause concern for all countries with russian nationals living within their borders
3588187 we cant allow a second munich when the international community climbed down to hitler that led to world war ii to a huge tragedy and millions of victims
3588188 thats not enough who guarantees that you will continue the moratorium lift the death penalty and then expect us extradite turkish criminals or people on wanted list
3588189 youre a great don even though i find you a bit odd
3588190 i love cooking and meeting people and will miss talking to new and old friends
3588191 but our lease is up and weve decided to close and say good bye
3588192 i feel the most important action one can take when trying to lose weight is to keep a food diary
3588193 yes it takes time to write down everything consumed during the day but this in itself can curtail overeating and be vital for self assessment and monitoring today it is easier than ever with computer based tools such as sparkpeoples free food tracker a few clicks and your results are known immediately
3588194 with the latest window worm on the rampage nobody but the lite side staff has even noticed switchback
3588195 by failing to integrate their efforts with offline search marketers are essentially ignoring the very channels that drive users to search
3588196 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3588197 about two days ago i got pretty upset because since ive been here theyve tested me four times and they took blood a lot of blood
3588198 they are taking so much blood i am going to be very weak before the final of the 100 meters
3588199 i said dexter what is it you really want to do
3588200 he said oh dad ill go to college but i really want to go there to play baseball
3588201 our goal was to ensure that he was happy because if hes happy hes going to do well regardless of where it is or what hes doing
3588202 see this here dexter youve accomplished a lot and you will continue to accomplish a lot but until you get this a degree this is big he told us specifically he would and is committed to getting an education
3588203 it seems like stores are promoting their prices and offering really good deals a lot more than in past years
3588204 consumers have been pessimistic for several months primarily because of the strains on their budgets from higher gas and food prices
3588205 you would never know that theres supposedly a bad climate for retail
3588206 back to school has been a difficult period for these retailers
3588207 july was difficult and we expect august to also be difficult
3588208 we went through a rigorous interview process and scott stood out among the other candidates as being a great communicator and providing structure to his team accountability in the locker room and disciplined play
3588209 he fits into our plan of developing our younger players and will connect with our veterans as well
3588210 garth has given me an unbelievable opportunity to coach in the nhl with the islanders
3588211 from my time coaching in providence ive seen firsthand the talented young players in this organization i look at the direction and the vision for this team and see a bright future
3588212 i know a little bit about his character and everything is as advertised it is evidenced by the way his teams have played that he is very structured in the defensive zone
3588213 if you take a close look at what scott has done with young players at providence you dont have that kind of success without patience
3588214 i just felt he was the best fit for our organization just because youre in the nhl doesnt mean youre done developing
3588215 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3588216 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3588217 its his physical ability its his ability to race its his ability to keep focused to get excited when he needs to and to come down when he needs to come down
3588218 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history
3588219 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty amazing accomplishment
3588220 if youre not involved in the sport im not sure you can fully appreciate it
3588221 he is way past anything you have seen he is incredible
3588222 i dont think michael will let his guard down until the last relay race
3588223 i dont think he has a comfort zone at all until the whole meet is over the whole olympic games he will not let his guard down because theres always someone out there
3588224 i can copy him but i dont think i could be as good as phelps
3588225 theyve been resting all week and just gearing themselves up for one race where every time michael gets up on the block he has to gear himself up for his performance that night or that morning
3588226 when i lose a race like that it motivates me even more to try to swim faster
3588227 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3588228 it really hasnt sunk in for me yet what has happened at this meet
3588229 it was great for me to qualify next to natalie coughlin because she takes it out so hard
3588230 and i knew kirsty coventry would be there all the way so i tried not to look at her and just concentrated on what i was doing
3588231 mmm nyari itu loh biscuit itu yang biasa aku beli
3588232 kacian deh momon kesayangankuu tiap pengen mam sesuatu pasti dah gak ada
3588233 i definitely want to win a medal i want to be known as the horse guy in american and be up there in all around
3588234 he told me whatever happens im always proud of you
3588235 its tough on him i did it for him this is his dream of a lifetime come true for him
3588236 for me personally i usually get excited about things too quickly and then if i have a letdown i get pretty angry about it so i taught myself not to handle situations like that to take it a little bit more professionally
3588237 we left home as underdogs were going to come back as heroes we have the heart and soul other countries dont have
3588238 and any time you practice a guy all the way through the offseason at one position practice him the first two weeks of training camp at a position and then put him in a game somewhere else you know its pretty unfair to put a guy in that situation
3588239 you try to learn guard the best you can so maybe youre not paying attention to what everybody else is doing youre just trying to focus on what youre doing trying to do every play just right
3588240 ive been impressed how he battles just a tough mean kid when he plays he doesnt take anything from anybody and thats what you like to see
3588241 some people always say playing o line is boring that when you play defense you get to tackle people to the ground
3588242 but in college the guy who had the most knockdowns in a game got the best grade its a hard game thats the way you have to play it
3588243 i pace i know i pace just waiting to go in i want to go 100 miles an hour because any day in this league you could get the phone call saying this is it
3588244 it was a crazy situation the packers tried to trade me didnt happen they released me late and carolina picked me up and i didnt have a chance to get in and learn the system
3588245 you always want the opportunity to come back and play somewhere
3588246 thats what im going to do im going to jump in with him hes a great corner im always trying to go against the best player i can out there
3588247 nobody price checks item by item they just know when they walk out with a bag of groceries that cost 80 there or you walk out with four bags of groceries that cost 80 here
3588248 he loved tlingit as i remember and wanted to do something good for it and make sure it continued
3588249 we developed a chip targeted at performance and then we took two of those chips and put them on one card people have tried to build bigger chips but the problem has been heat and cost its difficult for them to put two on one board because of space and power limitations
3588250 you progress not through improving what has been done but reaching toward what has yet to be done
3588251 its the only party i can ever remember attending at which were rented for the night and placed in the hosts beautiful pond i didnt know you could rent a swan they come with handlers in case you want to know
3588252 that could be a part of it but the fact is i have thrown a lot of innings
3588253 and if all that happens is i have to be pushed back a few days i dont see that as a major issue
3588254 its better to miss one start than try and fight through it and miss five or six
3588255 the idea is to be healthy the last six weeks of the season
3588256 solace in the fact that they only have one non white starter
3588257 we had a high of about 52 000 closings in 2006 about 49 000 last year and im anticipating about 47 000 this year
3588258 i think theres a trickle down effect of about 3 to 1 so a 1 5 billion drop has a 4 5 billion impact on the economy
3588259 real estate does seem to be the sector that is dragging us down
3588260 there are a lot of direct and indirect impacts as well as fiscal impacts
3588261 brokers who get smaller commissions end up paying less in taxes as their incomes drop for example
3588262 i cant comment on that andersens agent steven heumann said in a brief phone conversation at noon wednesday when asked if the nuggets have contacted him about his client
3588263 tim was a happy man he realized all of his dreams
3588264 when you play play hard when you work dont play at all
3588265 it just kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest i wanted to go 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad
3588266 michael phelps truly embodies the spirit of our go world campaign that celebrates memorable olympic moments and the extraordinary athletes who achieve them
3588267 we congratulate michael on this momentous achievement and wish him the best as he continues his march towards olympic history
3588268 the most curious fact about the detective story is that it makes its greatest appeal precisely to those classes of people who are most immune to other forms of daydream literature
3588269 i cannot play in denver because they question my drive to finish my career off strong and not embarrass my family artest wrote sunday night
3588270 any player wants to win a championship is low risk
3588271 thats not even an option to be a nugget he wrote
3588272 they let me know how they felt about me already
3588273 very exciting and linas kleiza and j r smith are very impressive when i watch them
3588274 carmelo made my son and daughter happy when we found out that he wanted me on his team artest wrote about star carmelo anthony having wanted the nuggets to trade for artest
3588275 he is my sons favorite player it made me feel blessed that he wanted me on his team and i immediately thanked god for that if god put me in denver its no question they would have been a better team
3588276 kiki really wanted marcus said cambys agent rick kaplan referring to new jersey general manager kiki vandeweghe the general manager in denver when the nuggets traded for camby in june 2002
3588277 they just gave away an all star caliber player for nothing kaplan said
3588278 he wants to go to a team thats really committed to winning kaplan said of camby
3588279 its a great acquisition for us clippers coach mike dunleavy who plans to start camby at power forward alongside clippers center chris kaman told the rocky mountain news
3588280 camby really complements our guys hes one of the best all around defenders in the league marcus is maybe even a better fit for us than elton hes coming off a great year and elton played just eight games last year due to injury
3588281 roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3588282 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and his values
3588283 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt
3588284 make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to our backgrounds
3588285 she focused primarily on issues that mattered to working families this was a strategy that was not employed discussed by senior staff or even pushed by mark penn
3588286 even if you concluded it would be a useful line of attack some of us were queasy about it
3588287 its fair to say that most people thought it would really rebound on her
3588288 the middle of america to the middle class in the middle of the last century
3588289 many people believe under the surface that 20 years sitting there with goddamn america would make obama unelectable by itself
3588290 what does that say about his leadership that he never left or complained
3588291 we are in for a real fight but assuming she at least achieves the projections for tuesday and given some breaks it is a fight that she can win
3588292 um exucse me where the hell do you think youre going get the fuck back here you worthless prude
3588293 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed people can change the world
3588294 this is a victory for californias students parents and education community this decision confirms the right every california child has to a quality education and the right parents have to decide what is best for their children i hope the ruling settles this matter for parents and homeschooled children once and for all in california but assure them that we as elected officials will continue to defend parents rights
3588295 i am pleased that the courts have clarified the right of california parents to homeschool their children i have respected the right of parents to make educational decisions they feel are in the best interest of their children i recognize and understand the consternation that the earlier court ruling caused for many parents and associations involved in homeschooling it is my hope that todays ruling will allay many of those fears and resolve much of the confusion
3588296 the worst possible outcome could have happened but we had the best possible outcome to that scenario
3588297 if i werent a designer illustrator i would have been a
3588298 recognizes the staff of a college university and community college library for programs that deliver exemplary services and resources to further the educational mission of the institution
3588299 tribute to a library and its staff for the outstanding services programs and leadership they provide to their students administrators faculty and community
3588300 exemplifies a successful transformation from a traditional research library to an innovative user centered library using technological advances to accomplish its goals
3588301 we have significant collections that we would like to make more widely accessible through digitization
3588302 the digitization technology provided by kirtas the support and service we receive from ristech and the ability of lulu to pull it all together increases both the electronic availability and the availability of the books in print for those who choose print on demand
3588303 we see more and more universities taking advantage of the print on demand option that is enabled through the digitization process
3588304 not only are these institutions sharing their unique collections but they are also creating a revenue stream that allows them to reinvest in their access and preservation efforts
3588305 this is a tremendous opportunity for our customers to obtain books that may not be easy to find

3588353 all of australias major banks increased interest rates by around 0 5 per cent on top of official rate rises in the past 12 months to protect themselves against an increase in their own borrowing costs
3588354 but after announcing a profit of 4 79 billion we have to ask if the bank is putting the needs of a relatively small number of investors over the thousands of families struggling to meet loan repayments and put food on the table

3588417 non ho il compito di farvi credere ho il compito di dirvelo
3588418 va dai sacerdoti e di loro di venire qui in processione e di costruire una cappella
3588419 la signora ha sorriso quando le ho detto che lei ha chiesto che facesse un miracolo
3588420 quel sarto di tarbes chiamato jacquet paralizzato da dodici anni a capo di una giovane e numerosa famiglia
3588421 questo un miracolo che lamministrazione non vuole malgrado il popolo lo voglia
3588422 lopera di lassere aveva risposto alle inclinazioni spirituali di pio ix che cercava di arginare la marea liberale e rivoluzionaria che lo stava sommergendo in italia

3588424 no diet will remove all the fat from your body because the brain is entirely fat without a brain you might look good but all you could do is run for public office
3588425 the devil has put a penalty on all things we enjoy in life either we suffer in health or we suffer in soul or we get fat
3588426 a conservative is a man who is too cowardly to fight and too fat to run
3588427 dont dig your grave with your own knife and fork
3588428 more die in the united states of too much food than of too little
3588429 ive decided that perhaps im bulimic and just keep forgetting to purge
3588430 in the middle ages they had guillotines stretch racks whips and cahins nowadays we have a much more effective torture device called the bathroom scale
3588431 its okay to be fat so youre fat just be fat and shut up about it
3588432 i feel about airplanes the way i feel about diets it seems to me that they are wonderful things for other people to go on
3588433 the one way to get thin is to re establish a purpose in life
3588434 avoid any diet that discourages the use of hot fudge
3588435 the biggest seller is cookbooks and the second is diet books how not to eat what youve just learned how to cook
3588436 gluttony is an emotional escape a sign something is eating us
3588437 if i had been around when rubens was painting i would have been revered as a fabulous model kate moss well she would have been the paintbrush
3588438 food is like sex when you abstain even the worst stuff begins to look good
3588439 the second day of a diet is always easier than the first by the second day youre off it
3588440 govern well thy appetite lest sin surprise thee and her black attendant death
3588441 people say that losing weight is no walk in the park when i hear that i think yeah thats the problem
3588442 as for food half of my friends have dug their graves with their teeth
3588443 to promise not to do a thing is the surest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing
3588444 i am not a glutton i am an explorer of food
3588445 its a very misused term and its a very badly understood term
3588446 and were exposed to that junk in the air in our food in our water supply
3588447 you dont know whats in the teas what ingredients what kind of effects theyre going to have on you and some of them have some pretty radical effects
3588448 the fat cells are what hold all the toxins and getting rid of them through the liver requires nutrients
3588449 lots of berries spinach broccoli then we include the whole grains and nuts and seeds
3588450 raw foods high antioxidants some of these liver friendly nutrients its a very smart thing to do
3588451 a 30 percent restriction in food intake doesnt affect body mass and only minimally reduces activity in deer mice but it eliminates the long term immune protection provided by antibodies
3588452 one wonders whether similar moderate food restriction has comparable immune effects in humans
3588453 more frequent and tend to be chronic in malnourished children
3588454 what weve got here on the table and what the menu really represents is how we want to eat in totality
3588455 this isnt jamba juice where we are dropping something in and boosting something up were talking about foods that exist in nature
3588456 they have a lot of vitamin c a lot of vitamin a more than carrot and they have a calcium too
3588457 when we feel good and happy about what were eating stress levels are lower were more likely to eat an appropriate quantity
3588458 music therapy is an evidence based practice that can affect changes in physical psychological social and cognitive domains through music experiences and the relationship that develops between the client and the therapist
3588459 self help through music is not music therapy although many people do use music for themselves for example for relaxation to improve their moods or to accompany exercise
3588460 involves an interpersonal process through which a trained therapist uses his or her knowledge and skills to address the clients assessed needs and issues
3588461 although many people understand intuitively how to use music for themselves when it is used within a music therapy process by a trained therapist it can be a powerful means to achieving positive physical psychological cognitive and social outcomes
3588462 music is a natural source of distraction when a child is visibly upset the introduction of a novel stimulus turning on some music will at least temporarily divert their attention away from what is upsetting them
3588463 the parents singing voice accomplishes the same thing and adds the element of familiarity the most comforting sound for an infant will nearly always be a parents voice when used regularly music and or singing can become a calming ritual and the infant then learns to associate the music with relaxation or sleep
3588464 music can activate the relaxation response which helps promote deep breathing lower heart rate lower blood pressure ease muscle tension and create less stress that can help cancer patients sleep better and difficulty sleeping is a common problem for cancer patients
3588465 relaxing the body can also help relieve physical pain and people may need less pain medication
3588466 some people can release their emotions through talking but sometimes people need a non verbal release weve had people moved to tears in our special events
3588467 people respond to music you dont have to be sick to respond to music its relaxing comforting and soothing
3588468 all it takes is an additional 100 calories a day or the equivalent of one snack sized chocolate bar and most adults will experience weight creep before they even know it
3588469 dont get sucked into the see food diet mentality that makes you want to eat the candy simply because you see it and not because you are hungry
3588470 we eat more of visible foods because it causes us to think about it more and every time you see the candy bowl you have to decide whether you want a piece of candy or not
3588471 simply thinking of food can make you hungry so when you see or smell something associated with food like the shiny foil wrapped kisses it can actually make you salivate
3588472 sour candy gummy textured candies hard candies and the others that are not chocolate are lower in fat and calories and typically not the candy we overeat
3588473 it is so easy to pop a piece of candy into your mouth mindlessly and not get the full enjoyment you would get if you saved it and ate it when you know you will enjoy it the most
3588474 studies have shown that gum chewing can also help you relieve stress mentally focus on tasks satisfy a sweet tooth overcome the urge to eat candy and help manage hunger pangs to hold you over until your next meal
3588475 if you have to get up to get a piece of candy it is not always worth the effort whereas when the candy is convenient consumption is higher
3588476 if you keep the wrappers on your desk it will remind you of how many you ate and hopefully inspire you to exercise moderation and stop after one or two
3588477 people tend to be disappointed with the degree of weight loss they achieve with these drugs even when they know that modest weight loss will improve their health
3588478 people who are desperate to lose weight are usually willing to try drugs but if they dont see the results they want in two or three months they dont tend to stay on them
3588479 anti obesity drugs can help people achieve modest weight loss but they have to be taken indefinitely or the weight will come back
3588480 patients and their practitioners have to make a bit of a leap of faith if they plan to continue on these medications for several years
3588481 selling anti obesity drugs over the counter will perpetuate the myth that obesity can be fixed simply by popping a pill and could further undermine the efforts to promote healthy living which is the only long term escape from obesity
3588482 im afraid i regard this as a rather cynical money making enterprise on their part
3588483 alli is neither a magic pill nor a quick fix solution and we have certainly never marketed it that way
3588484 the way this product has been marketed from day one has been to educate the consumer about the importance of making lifestyle changes
3588485 although the article describes the weight loss achieved as modest it does recognize that even modest amounts of weight loss 5 10 are beneficial particularly in patients at risk for developing type 2 diabetes
3588486 clinical studies demonstrate that losing and maintaining weight loss of 5 10 significantly reduces serious health risks of obesity like diabetes and cardiovascular disease
3588487 when combined with diet and exercise meridia can achieve 5 10 weight loss
3588488 the downgrades reflect our opinion that projected credit support for the affected classes is insufficient to maintain the previous ratings given our current projected losses
3588489 let me be honest again even with the concepts below weight loss isn
3588490 it seems that normally with sweet foods that we rev up our metabolism to prepare for that calorie load what happens when you put a diet food in your mouth your taste buds taste sweet but then theres no calorie load that comes with it theres some sort of a mismatch here and it seems that it changes your brain chemistry in some way
3588491 use it properly and have a well balanced diet and you really can improve your mood
3588492 not only does your food affect your mood your mood affects the food youll choose
3588493 unfortunately the average consumer isnt eating a healthy enough diet let alone a diet that will put them in a good mood
3588494 but its not by chance that stress has been going up and depression has been going up and obesity is going up
3588495 attempting to treat clinical depression on your own through food is not a good idea
3588496 also treating a bad mood with foods can leave you with unwanted excess weight and negative feelings about food
3588497 ive seen people make dramatic improvements in depression and anxiety within a week of making some simple dietary changes
3588498 they are probably the hottest thing presently in terms of helping the brain heal and helping mood through eating properly
3588499 a small amount of coffee or caffeine may help you feel more energized and alert
3588500 too much may backfire leaving you feeling more stressed and jittery
3588501 a patient with bipolar disorder may react positively to coffee when depressed where as mania could be exacerbated
3588502 both sex and dark chocolate activate the same parts of the brain
3588503 sugar and alcohol elate momentarily while they shoot excessive sugar into the system amp but the resultant insulin response drives the blood sugar to dive low creating brain and ultimate mood changes such as anxiety depression hopelessness and or sadness
3588504 alcohol will help you go to sleep but you will wake up rapidly
3588505 you just want to be very kind and loving to yourself
3588506 theres no question that when we eat something that really pleases us amp presumably it sets off certain reward centers in the brain
3588507 it is not dissimilar to the centers associated with drug abuse and sex
3588508 they dont require much work for the body to break down
3588509 your body is saying do me a favor lets just take it easy i dont want to work hard
3588510 then you can feel good and have selected number of treats as a favor to yourself
3588511 it is addictive to eat that sort of lipid laden diet
3588512 most of us are busy amp and many people put themselves last
3588513 fast food is horrible for the salt content alone never mind the fat and calories but when were stressed were looking for rapid solutions emotionally centering yourself will be immensely helpful
3588514 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3588515 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3588516 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3588517 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3588518 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3588519 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3588520 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3588521 this is the toughest decision any prosecutor has to make
3588522 north carolina is leading the fight for clean air because its critical to our health and our economy
3588523 our petition to the epa coupled with our lawsuit against tva can reduce significantly the air pollution coming into our state from coal fired utility smokestacks
3588524 loss of energy loss of sleep severe tension profound shock and anxiety
3588525 blogging is like masturbating into a mirror while you videotape yourself so you can watch it later while you masturbate

3588528 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3588529 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3588530 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3588531 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3588532 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3588543 now its time for healing up the party after this primary
3588544 weve spent 10 months on this campaign so we can wait a while longer
3588545 obviously its a huge uphill climb but we want to see how the mountain counties come in and see how the voting today turned out
3588546 we decided what we teach our employees would be helpful to our customers too

3588550 not just people food but pet food vitamins and household products
3588551 these products are the lowest priced products in each category plus they not only meet our quality standards for excluding artificial ingredients and hydrogenated fats they also do not contain high fructose corn syrup and avoid gmos genetically modified organisms ingredients
3588552 and we cut out coupons for you and put them next to the item the coupon is good for
3588553 its cheaper to buy the whole chicken rather than chicken parts
3588554 if you dont like cutting up the chicken ask the butcher to do it for you its a service actually ask the butcher to cut the exact size of meat you want you arent stuck with more meat than you actually need
3588555 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race

3588564 you dont know how many reps were going to get
3588565 im anxious to see us play a whole game i think the more time you have together the more comfortable and relaxed you are to play together
3588566 like ive said this is not the time to be talking about whos on the field and whos not on the field were getting ready to go into the season and if were going to go into the season and try to win and seriously be committed to doing it youre going to have to push your ego aside for a year
3588567 i love to compete when im watching film and i see my teammates out there competing and getting after it and making plays something just comes into me makes me want to get out there if my brothers are out there and im not out there its kind of frustrating but im back and feeling good
3588568 definitely i should have made that interception hands down nine times out of 10 i never miss that play but one play doesnt make a game we lost and life goes on you have to move forward
3588569 people can say whatever they want like i said one play doesnt make a game whoever said things im sure they had a couple messed up plays that had an affect on the game

3588585 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3588586 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3588587 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3588588 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3588589 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3588590 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3588591 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3588592 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3588593 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3588594 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3588595 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3588596 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3588597 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3588598 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3588599 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3588600 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3588601 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

3588606 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3588607 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3588608 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3588609 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3588610 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3588611 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3588612 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3588613 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3588614 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3588615 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3588616 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3588617 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3588618 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3588619 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3588620 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3588621 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3588622 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3588623 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3588624 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3588625 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3588626 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3588627 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3588628 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3588629 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3588630 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3588631 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3588632 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3588633 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3588634 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3588635 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3588636 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3588637 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3588638 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3588639 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3588640 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3588641 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3588642 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

3588644 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

3588648 it was one of those pleasant surprises to come off the terrible month that we had in cincinnati and then you get a phone call saying youre being traded to a first place team as a player thats all you could ask for
3588649 its clear weve got to address our bullpen its safe to say its one of our highest priorities the thing thats been a disappointment has been the lack of reinforcements from our farm system we really thought we would be better there but none of those things has happened
3588650 the all star game and the home run derby have nothing to do with it ive been struggling ever since i came back from the ankle injury its just not as strong as it was before
3588651 if we dont make it this year im not going to explode injuries are a part of the game and in 35 years since weve owned the yankees ive never seen a rash of injuries like this
3588652 im a big fan of joes considering the injuries and what hes done with the bullpen without joba it speaks volumes to what hes capable of doing and how smart he is at some point theres nothing you can do
3588653 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3588654 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3588655 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3588656 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

3588659 the russians have said that they do want to be a part of that prosperous and forward looking international community and frankly they are doing great damage to their ability to do that
3588660 there are any number of opportunities for russia to reverse course and to demonstrate that it is trying to behave according to 21st century principles
3588661 but i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here

3588675 of course you know i want to make sure that our education is stressed immensely i want to see we have so much development going on and i want to know exactly why we have it and how it can be improved and certainly protect our environment i still like the idea of downtown revitalization coming up the fifth street corridor there are things that can be done for this city and our citizens
3588676 thats what i taught these kids to do all along get involved
3588677 i have taught the theory of the governmental process for 45 years

3588679 i will give you a very simple instruction easy to understand easy to follow all you have to do is listen and follow my instruction by heart and by mind ready
3588680 alright heres my instruction dont think of a black cat
3588681 now even if i told you not to think of a black cat the picture of a black cat appears in your mind right you cant stop of thinking of a black cat
3588682 i really didnt think there was any such thing as this

3588687 we think well have a good supply for our customers
3588688 some fronts may be followed by chilling southerly winds with hail and or sleet
3588689 since there was no significant broad scale influence on our weather patterns during the next few months it opened the possibility for more variability and variety
3588690 we do not expect any one particular pattern to dominate for any more than a week or two
3588691 occasional polar blasts that bring chilling winds from the southern ocean are also on the menu
3588692 the great warming climate change and the rise and fall of civilizations
3588693 when i began writing the book i expected to focus on europe
3588694 but as i looked further afield i realized that for a lot of the world the medieval warm period meant savage issues related to drought with so much of the world currently suffering from the effects of drought this struck me as a neglected problem
3588695 if you look at the warm centuries with a global perspective the wide incidence of drought is truly striking and offers a sobering message about tomorrows world prolonged aridity was widespread in medieval times and killed enormous numbers of people evidence is mounting that drought is the silent and insidious killer associated with global warming
3588696 in such a tiny minority view now with their point of view theyre almost like the ones who still believe that the moon landing was staged in a movie lot in arizona and those who believe the world is flat
3588697 b oth past and future anthropogenic man made carbon dioxide emissions will continue to contribute to global warming and sea level rise for more than a millennium due to the time scales required for removal of this gas from the atmosphere
3588698 the press is not invited or permitted to cover the event unless express written permission is granted by the harry walker agency inc
3588699 t ell a lie enough and it becomes accepted as truth
3588700 eleven inaccuracies have to be specifically drawn to the attention of the students
3588701 s ome dastardly scientists with environmental and political motives manipulated long term scientific data to create an illusion of rapid global warming other scientists of the same environmental whacko type jumped into the circle to support and broaden the research to further enhance the totally slanted bogus global warming claims their friends in government steered huge research grants their way to keep the movement going soon they claimed to be a consensus
3588702 i have a feeling this is the opening if the lawyers will take the case sue the people who sell carbon credits that includes al gore that lawsuit would get so much publicity so much media attention and as the experts went to the witness stand and testified i feel like that could become the vehicle to finally put some light on the fraud of global warming
3588703 carbon dioxide co2 is 0 000383 of our atmosphere by volume only 0 0275 of atmospheric co2 is man made in origin we are responsible for 0 00001 of this atmosphere if the atmosphere were a 100 story building our man made co2 contribution today would be equivalent to the linoleum on the first floor
3588704 weve been warming up about a degree per century since the little ice age lia in about 1600 weve been warming for 400 years long before human generated co2 could have anything to do with the climate
3588705 o f course its going up it has gone up since the early 1800s before the industrial revolution because were coming out of the lia not because we are putting more carbon dioxide into the air
3588706 r ecent observations of phenomena such as glacial retreats sea level rise and the migration of temperature sensitive species are not evidence for abnormal climate change for none of these changes has been shown to lie outside the bounds of known natural variability 2 the average rate of warming of 0 1 to 0 2 degrees celsius per decade recorded by satellites during the late 20th century fall within known natural rates of warming and cooling over the last 10 000 years 3 leading scientists including some senior ipcc representatives acknowledge that todays computer models cannot predict climate consistent with this and despite computer projections of temperature rises there has been no net global warming since 1998 that the current temperature plateau follows a late 20th century period of warming is consistent with the continuation today of natural multi decadal or millennial climate cycling
3588707 in stark contrast to the oft repeated assertion that the science of climate change is settled significant new peer reviewed research has cast even more doubt on the hypothesis of dangerous human caused global warming but because these ipcc working groups were generally instructed to consider work published only through may 2005 these important findings are not included in their reports i e the ipcc assessment reports are already materially outdated
3588708 a ttemps to prevent global climate change from occurring are ultimately futile and constitute a tragic misallocation of resources that would be better spent on humanitys real and pressing problems
3588709 global climate has always changed and always will independent of the actions of humans and that carbon dioxide co2 is not a pollutant but rather a necessity for all life there is no convincing evidence that co2 emissions from modern industrial activity has in the past is now or will in the future cause catastrophic climate change now therefore we recommend that world leaders reject the view expressed by the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change as well as popular but misguided works such as an inconvenient truth
3588710 a little depressing so far ha it would have been nice to go to aquaboggan today
3588711 possible observations at a specific point in time that may have changed to no longer support the global warming cause so well just keep repeating old data until you believe it
3588712 sea levels are going to rise one foot over the next 100 years but well say 20 feet just to scare them
3588713 all civilization as we know it will be wiped from the face of the planet
3588714 the poor that cant afford to move away from low lying areas may have their homes flooded if theres a really really high tide
3588715 they understand there is a threat but while it exists its not going to be in their lifetime or maybe even in their childrens he said
3588716 people want to live by the sea and a lot of them will take these risks he said
3588717 theyll accept them hoping a solution can be found they think perhaps a sea wall can be built dr hunter said it was wrong to think the problems posed by rising sea levels were years away
3588718 the improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority as such for him scepticism is the highest of duties blind faith the one unpardonable sin
3588719 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
3588720 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
3588721 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child

3588723 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added
3588724 the case is actively being investigated and were monitoring developments closely to determine possible charges
3588725 i just screamed to tom weve got to make a difference
3588726 i think you can be detached from your work day to day in a certain degree its not like this this was emotional because it was close to people we know

3588729 its very frustrating because the longer we wait the more mold well get and the more damage will occur and we just have to wait for help
3588730 they were right in here facing our most damaged room

3588736 for a citizens advisory board to work it needs input
3588737 it needs ideas and suggestions and the one thing to remember is if we can all find a common ground were all going to win

3588742 there has been a lot of talk in this trial about anti muslim sentiment and anti muslim feeling in the community justice bongiorno said
3588743 prejudice sympathy and such things have no part in a criminal trial
3588744 it is important that you determine the case on the evidence you have heard not on any other idea or comment you may have heard justice bongiorno said
3588745 it is important that you dont do any research of your own

3588750 i feel its insulting to women to remove a vulva because of somebodys attitude
3588751 some of these so called civic leaders are a little immature themselves looking at the female creative power i guess its a very deep rooted ancient fear that men have women are able to reproduce
3588752 is so the truth and facts will be allowed to surface without the misuse of our words and biased opinions from mainstream local media
3588753 we will use this opportunity to happily clear up any doubts or uncertainties pertaining to our case the false allegations against us as well as the your black muslim bakery establishment
3588754 with all the biased reporting by the local mainstream can the bakery 4 bey and three other defendants in the kidnapping and torture case still receive a fair trial
3588755 i am not locked up on any charges connected to the death of chauncey bailey i would not be locked up now had the government not used the tragedy of chauncey bailey as a way to divert peoples attention from the false allegations i am presently being locked up for
3588756 i am not surprised when i see and hear the local media and newspapers try to connect myself and the bakery to the death of chauncey bailey as i have stated many times before myself nor the bakery had nothing to do with the chauncey bailey killing
3588757 as i have stated before i was never very fond of mr bailey but one thing he did not deserve was to be killed

3588787 weve asked mike skinner to evaluate areas where we can improve our on track performance
3588788 i thought he did a really nice job of working with red bull and a j allmendinger earlier this year and our no 00 champion mortgage team could use the same experienced insight
3588789 we feel the same way about michael mcdowell as we did when we signed him
3588790 but this is the toughest most competitive form of racing in the world and i know michael and mwr can benefit from skinners input
3588791 i support doing whatever it takes to improve the performance of our team
3588792 no driver wants to get out of the car but i understand that every part of our program needs to be evaluated and that certainly includes me i plan to support mike skinner and our team any way i can and hopefully learn some things that will help when i get back in the car
3588793 i know its tough for drivers like michael mcdowell when they make the big jump to the nascar sprint cup series from other divisions like the arca series or the nascar craftsman truck series but michael has done a really good job for mwr in a sport thats fiercely competitive

3588806 in retrospect i dont know how sincere he was about it

3588815 cyberbullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
3588816 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area

3588818 moreover the vehicle for the cyberbullying at issue here a social networking web site only became mainstream after 2000

3588833 we had heard of tragic hero but had been talking to a lot of other labels and were trying to find the right home for us after talking to tommy and meeting with dave we knew we found our label they have the same excitement and enthusiasm about our band as we do and thats what we were waiting for we are very excited to be a part of the family

3588844 i mean nick xenophon with due respect hasnt yet been sworn in as a senator hasnt yet sat there in the senate
3588845 there are unintended consequences it could kill independent operators in terms of wiping them out and it will consolidate the big oil players senator xenophon told abc radio today
3588846 were still wanting to understand how it wont push petrol prices
3588847 it was always going to be the case with fuelwatch and im particularly unsurprised about the comments from mr xenophon this morning
3588848 of course in the lead up to the vote in the senate we will be taking senator xenophon up on his offer of discussion and if theres anything he can propose that meets his concerns while meeting the fundamental policy aims of the government to get more transparency in the petrol market and get rid of what is effectively collusion in the market we will be happy to talk that through

3588866 generally you want your servers where you can eyeball them
3588867 its the backbone of our business its all our data all our donor information and all our financial information we really needed to have that secure
3588868 quite frankly the room we were in wasnt suitable in terms of cooling
3588869 the power supply is not always the most reliable either
3588870 a non profit is a challenge really like any smaller business because they have the same needs that larger companies do but there are not a lot of resources there
3588871 especially in this case they have to keep track of volunteers solicit donations and maintain security around all that data using a third party like ourselves makes sense because they couldnt afford to do this themselves
3588872 just from a physical standpoint you have to go through a security desk and there are lots of card key access points
3588873 we also run network intrusion detection software to make sure hackers are kept away and have security specialists on staff 24 7 some of that may exist in an office environment but it usually doesnt
3588874 im more worried about the desktops and laptops we have floating around our offices now as something could go wrong much more easily with them
3588875 i have piece of mind having the servers actually out of this environment
3588876 if you are a smaller company you can really benefit from putting your it infrastructure into a secure location
3588877 if we didnt need to spend and arm and leg to retrofit our environment thing might have been different but for now its a piece of the business that we dont have to worry about
3588878 as they grow up theyre going to want that option
3588879 ill be this will fit inside an envelope pretty easily
3588880 what we have done is take two very different approaches to the challenge of creating bulk metamaterials that can exhibit negative refraction in optical frequencies
3588881 both bring us a major step closer to the development of practical applications for metamaterials
3588882 natural materials do not respond to the magnetic field of light but the metamaterial we created here does
3588883 it is the first bulk material that can be described as having optical magnetism so both the electrical and magnetic fields in a light wave move backward in the material
3588884 the geometry of the vertical nanowires which were equidistant and parallel to each other were designed to only respond to the electrical field in light waves
3588885 the magnetic field which oscillates at a perpendicular angle to the electrical field in a light wave is essentially blind to the upright nanowires a feature which significantly reduces energy loss
3588886 what makes both these materials stand out is that they are able to function in a broad spectrum of optical wavelengths with lower energy loss
3588887 weve also opened up a new approach to developing metamaterials by moving away from previous designs that were based upon the physics of resonance previous metamaterials in the optical range would need to vibrate at certain frequencies to achieve negative refraction leading to strong energy absorption resonance is not a factor in both the nanowire and fishnet metamaterials
3588888 its clear my issues of smart growth versus uncontrolled growth and reining in the influences has resonated with the voters
3588889 obviously im happy i appreciate the voters confidence in me
3588890 and the influence is absolutely not true if theres so much influence why did we increase development fees i have done that without exception
3588891 i will continue to fight for a sensible energy policy that lowers gas prices
3588892 fiscal responsibility and smaller government and the enforcement of our current immigration laws
3588893 sometimes the message is more important than the messenger i dont plan on going anywhere i think we need to maintain the ron paul backing libertarian leaning wing of the republican party
3588894 theres nothing like an election to refocus your attention on your constituents so i am very grateful of course to the people who took the time to vote today
3588895 we wish to apologize for this mistake and are currently analyzing our approach to ensure there is a more vigorous review process put in place prior to printing the sample ballot for future election

3588898 our mcp technology platform has the capability to deliver thousands of completely new inorganic molecules from one cost effective manufacturing process

3588901 degrees of freedom that shorten new material system development cycles and will enable disruptive new product applications
3588902 building on the outstanding work of professor peter burke at uci rf nano has developed low cost manufacturing processes and extended its leadership position in the application of carbon nanotubes to high performance analog electronics
3588903 oxantium is pleased to be the lead investor for this round of investment in rf nano
3588904 rf nanos technology will enable a new generation of robust high bandwidth wireless devices as rf nano harnesses the fundamental promise of carbon nanotubes the semiconductor world will be forever changed
3588905 we continue to be enthusiastic investors in rf nano they have built a strong team with deep industry experience focused on delivering against the tremendous potential for utilizing carbon nanotubes in rf applications
3588906 initial feedback from major players in the rf marketplace confirms our belief in the game changing nature of rf nanos product pipeline
3588907 as we have stated in the past we are focused upon reaching profitability this transaction along with other organizational adjustments which have been recently made reduces our net cash expenses by approximately 500 000 per year or approximately 20 as a management team we have been investigating for some time options to reduce our expense level in order to minimize the amount of required external funding and accelerate our ability to achieve profitability from operations in that light we felt it appropriate to focus on our revenue generating instrumentation related products and technologies realizing meaningful cost savings via this transaction with aspera as an alternative to curtailing some or all research and development activities on the scientific applications in order to achieve the cost savings was a much better alternative for our shareholders additionally as the granted licenses are non exclusive we retain the ability to partner with others in these areas or to further develop the technologies ourselves
3588908 in addition to the financial benefits of this transaction we are now poised to devote 100 of our efforts towards exploiting the opportunity for our instruments to be key enablers of breakthrough projects occurring in the areas of stem cell research neural regeneration and biosensing and the increased use of live cell assays for drug discovery and development from an operational perspective the bioforce organization is squarely focused upon exploiting the market opportunities for our nano enabler and cyto enabler molecular printing systems and other instrumentation oriented products and services this is important as we look to expand our presence in the academic research community as well as initiate sales to the commercial sector

3588910 we now know that hivcide i was clearly superior to the triple drug combo cocktail in all parameters we observed
3588911 the novel mechanism of action of hivcide i defines a new class of anti hiv drugs this enables that it can be combined with the existing cocktail in such a combination a much greater level of effectiveness could be achieved compared to what is possible today
3588912 if our preliminary results can be duplicated in humans it is quite possible that hivcide i either alone or in combination with the current combo cocktail may provide a functional cure for hiv aids

3588918 i explained to the ladies last spring that we have become a competitive team in our conference this preseason poll exemplifies how other teams perceive us
3588919 our players realize that the preseason poll isnt near as important as the final season results our focus is to finish the regular season ranked first or second going into the kcac conference tournament
3588920 this is what i expected i will pay more attention to where we finish come november
3588921 we return some very good players and have a real strong recruiting class its just a matter of stepping on the field and putting things together now its going to be another very competitive year and we are looking forward to it
3588922 wayne just got out to a pretty big lead and in the first couple frames i didnt throw the ball well because of nerves
3588923 wayne hurt himself in the sixth but still managed to throw some strikes he struck in the 10 th and i knew what i had to do its very exciting very overwhelming for me
3588924 my only strategy was to stay focused and relaxed when youre bowling a hall of famer and champion like wayne webb you need to throw a lot of strikes

3588936 desde abajo se ven peque as barracas sobre la colina pero no se ve toda la vida que hay dentro de la favela estos retratos miran a la ciudad asfaltada en lugar de ser nosotros quienes les observamos a trav s de los medios de comunicaci n son ellos los que nos observan
3588937 ahora mismo tengo frente a m una gran foto pegada en una casa con cuatro ventanas abiertas veo a la gente dentro haciendo su vida la instant nea empieza a quedar un poco tapada por la ropa tendida y toda esa vida me parece m s interesante a n que la propia imagen

3588942 la biblioteca digital europea brindar un modo r pido y f cil para que la gente acceda a los libros y al arte europeos tanto en su pa s como en el extranjero
3588943 sin embargo y aunque los estados miembros han registrado grandes progresos en lo que respecta a la difusi n de contenidos culturales en internet son necesarias mayores inversiones p blicas y privadas para agilizar la digitalizaci n mi objetivo es que exista una biblioteca digital europea llamada europeana y que el p blico pueda acceder a sus ricos contenidos antes de acabar el a o
3588944 it is time for us to give a round of applause to doug
3588945 this is his night and we need to unite behind his nomination
3588946 while we congratulate doug on his victory tonight i want each of you to know that our campaign did make a difference this is not how we wanted it to turn out but the ideas we promoted in this campaign ending earmarks cutting the size of government reforming washington think about it for a minute these ideas defined the debate in this campaign our ideas defined this campaign
3588947 we made almost 20 000 volunteer phone calls since thursday night in just the past five weeks we walked about 70 precincts across the district i cant thank you enough for all the work you did i am truly honored to have had your support
3588948 we lost this battle but ultimately i believe candidacies like the one we ran will end up winning the war the voters of this district indeed the entire country want a smaller government toward that end i hope that all three candidates in this race their staffs and volunteers included will come together now to help elect doug id like to propose all three campaigns participate in a giant precinct walk sometime next week to benefit the entire republican ticket
3588949 when it was painted bright pink it was totally unacceptable
3588950 its not the councils job to deliberately offend people and by leaving it there we would deliberately offend people
3588951 this takes us back to the beginning of the last century when public artworks were censored back in britain at the beginning of modern sculpture
3588952 i feel its insulting to women to remove a vulva because of somebodys attitude
3588953 some of these so called civic leaders are a little immature themselves looking at the female creative power i guess its a very deep rooted ancient fear that men have women are able to reproduce
3588954 the crossbench senators and the government are coming from the same direction
3588955 we want to see more transparency and competition in the fuel market
3588956 the only people opposed to that transparency are the opposition theyll oppose fuelwatch which means well have discussions with the other senators as weve begun to do and were always going to need to do
3588957 all legislation in the current environment is requiring discussion and negotiation to get through the senate and im particularly unsurprised that fuelwatch would be any different
3588958 the number of independents in wa has gone down by no more than in any other state and territory in australia and indeed independents have reduced in numbers around the world so theres no evidence theres any link between fuelwatch and a reduction in independents at all
3588959 he has to put his hand up and say that fuelwatch is dead
3588960 people feel as if they have just eaten a great meal and later on you tell them there was a fly in it
3588961 the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3588962 open innovation the new imperative for creating and profiting from technology
3588963 a classy consistent wine of the first order starts off with delicate floral and melon aromas the honeysuckle component persisting on through the long finish its the wines minerality rather than this floral sweetness that is its highlight round and just viscous enough closing with mineral and white pepper
3588964 energy shortages most notably in south africa but also in north america and chile forced supply down artificially helping to boost prices but that is a problem that has been in the works of being fixed since the 1st quarter once it is done supply will rise to meet the growing demand and be a signal for profit taking
3588965 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3588966 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3588967 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
3588968 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
3588969 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3588970 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3588971 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3588972 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3588973 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3588974 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3588975 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3588976 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3588977 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3588978 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3588979 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3588980 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3588981 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3588982 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

3588984 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
3588985 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro

3588995 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos

3588997 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3588998 i dont know what happened after the first set i just lost the match overall it was a good game but i just dont know what happened

3589009 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3589010 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida

3589015 si usted fracasa fracasamos todos los ind genas del mundo
3589016 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3589017 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3589018 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3589019 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3589020 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
3589021 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
3589022 we must indeed all hang together or most assuredly we shall all hang separately
3589023 contra el saqueo y la contaminaci n por la soberania alimentaria
3589024 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 y la declaraci n de las naciones unidas esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
3589025 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 ratificado por ley no 1257 y actualmente la declaraci n de las naciones unidas ratificada por ley no 3760 esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
3589026 las personas privadas extranjeras que operan en el pa s como es la empresa manquiri subsidiaria de la minera americana coeur dalene como en el presente caso y que tienen adem s instancias encargadas de velar que el desempe o de sus inversiones es la tarea de opic no derive en da os a las comunidades ind genas y originaria son bien acogidas sus iniciativas de soluci n de conflictos que permitan alcanzar una real y efectiva restituci n de los derechos vulnerados o en riesgo de ser vulnerados
3589027 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales
3589028 en el marco de sus atribuciones y competencias conferidas por la constituci n pol tica del estado y la ley no 1818 en lo que toca a preservar el respeto a los derechos humanos de los pueblos ind genas reflejados en el ordenamiento jur dico nacional y los instrumentos internacionales reconocidos por bolivia
3589029 la empresa va a tratar de resolver este conflicto muy r pidamente para no da ar m s su reputaci n los miembros del ayllu no deber an someterse a una negociaci n que no tiene condiciones justas y deber an exigir que opic tome la responsabilidad por los incumplimientos de sus pol ticas por parte de la empresa minera en cuesti n
3589030 kalau ada orang meragukan itu malah bagus karena wacana ini akan semakin bergulir masyarakat bisa lebih kritis

3589032 we expect more than 20 percent growth in profits for 2008 and at least 20 percent growth in profits for 2009
3589033 it depends on the rebel resistance how fast we can proceed with the rehabilitation phase
3589034 we have to clear the area and declare it safe first
3589035 a lot of the farm animals were stolen plants and farms destroyed
3589036 what began as a simple graceful photo to wish luck to the spanish basketball team in the olympic games has finished with accusations of racism and discrimination in the foreign press
3589037 the hayes family is comfortable with dr kraus recommendation to not conduct an autopsy
3589038 we are overwhelmed with the outpouring of support and love from isaacs dear friends colleagues and fans from every corner of the world and we thank each and every one of them for their kind thoughts and prayer
3589039 while he was an iconic figure to many to us he was husband father and friend we will ever miss his love wisdom humor and the familiar comfort of his voice
3589040 we are not interested in becoming crorepatis millionaires but in making others crorepatis millionaires
3589041 im at a nursery down on highway 12 and they have crape myrtle trees on sale yes thats right can i buy some i can how many
3589042 i dont know jospehine maybe she doesnt have any money to buy food
3589043 im sure she does or at least she did when she was a baby
3589044 michael waltrip racing is fully committed to our sponsors the success of our race teams and ensuring michael mcdowell david reutimann and i have the necessary tools to succeed as drivers
3589045 weve asked mike skinner to evaluate areas where we can improve our on track performance
3589046 i thought he did a really nice job of working with red bull and a j allmendinger earlier this year and our no 00 champion mortgage team could use the same experienced insight
3589047 we feel the same way about michael mcdowell as we did when we signed him
3589048 but this is the toughest most competitive form of racing in the world and i know michael and mwr can benefit from skinners input
3589049 i support doing whatever it takes to improve the performance of our team
3589050 no driver wants to get out of the car but i understand that every part of our program needs to be evaluated and that certainly includes me i plan to support mike skinner and our team any way i can and hopefully learn some things that will help when i get back in the car
3589051 we just walked in there and somebody told us that she was going to come
3589052 new jerseyans recognize they need the experience of senator mccain
3589053 these are difficult times and the russians have to understand that that kind of conduct was not acceptable in the 20th century and its certainly not acceptable in the 21st century
3589054 we have to bring back prosperity keep taxes low and make sure we create new jobs
3589055 convicted of an offense involving or touching such office position or employment
3589056 we felt all along that the waiver was appropriate given the overall circumstances of the case
3589057 although we felt rones actions were inappropriate we felt she was a candidate for waiver the judge obviously felt differently
3589058 at the end of the day this is a misdemeanor conviction
3589059 i dont think the statute was meant to have this type of effect the penalties are more severe than for some people who have served time for felonies and have come out of prison and run for office
3589060 it seems highly unusual for the court to be involved in this way
3589061 but the council runs the risk of impugning its own reputation you want to circle the wagons and defend your own but they also have to look at the negative perception of politicians in new jersey this could contribute to the perception that its corrupt politicians protecting each other
3589062 every bomb we hope its going to be the last
3589063 they try to support us they understand us they come and say that you know we are really sorry and we are your friends and we are we are
3589064 we need the whole country to be saved and all georgians to be alive
3589065 we said people are dying we cant sing and dance here
3589066 we have access to the gymnasiums to tracks to what americans would call a field house ball fields a pool and a weight room
3589067 theres also housing for the coaching staff of the high performance center personal coaches and support personnel
3589068 i like kobe bryant everyone in my school likes him
3589069 im pretty excited about their coming but in terms of impact the construction sites have been pretty annoying to the whole school
3589070 students at beishida have to go outside to play football or basketball
3589071 people are excited to have the team here but theyre not as excited about things being closed
3589072 its really not enough compared with the work the school has been doing day and night over the last three to four months
3589073 you need to look at the bigger picture you cant just describe the importance of a specific amount of money we contribute to the beijing olympics we raise the profile of the university in the news which we see because you are here and the fact that the u s delegation is here boosts the sports related curriculum
3589074 they would do it anyway regardless as part of their daily work
3589075 its a reflection of how competitive the games have become
3589076 there is a text it has been accepted in moscow it was accepted here in georgia i have the agreement of all the protagonists
3589077 mr saakashvili can no longer be our partner and it would be better if he went
3589078 the russians can use whatever public rhetoric they want against saakashvili but as long as he is the elected president they will have to deal with him
3589079 i want to make very clear that the u s stands with the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and its people
3589080 allies reiterated in very strong terms the full respect necessary for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia
3589081 and that is more than a phrase in a period of time when that territorial integrity is not respected by russia
3589082 0 bin are actually colder by a 2 1 margin
3589083 ang dami ko pang gagawin dito sa batangas im not running im not even entertaining it pagtakbo sa 2010 vp elections
3589084 sweet naman ni bong thank you thank you pero all i can say is that he can plan his political career if he really wants to run for vice president wala siyang dapat na i worry sa akin
3589085 i have a deep love for the sound of vintage martin guitars from 1928 to 1945 that was the sound i was going for and that was the design i chose to start with that was my textbook
3589086 acoustic guitar is a monster as far as getting the sound and volume out of it but this lucas guitar is something else its the best old sounding new guitar ive heard
3589087 avec nous a va tre diff rent on va te laisser de la place
3589088 great white fear of the dark phallus big black barack
3589089 great white fear of the dark phallus big black barack
3589090 wow what is going on there must be very exciting
3589091 ive already said that in accordance with the united nations code we are trying to force georgia which started the aggression to peace we find this tactic very effective and the only possible one i want to remind you that history has seen many examples of pacification by the aggressor in this way western countries did it seventy years ago and you know the tragic consequences of it i mean the lessons of the munich agreement of 1938
3589092 we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country we are in the process of the destruction of world order as it was established after the end of the cold war and it is so obvious that the world has to react there is no way georgian people would ever live with occupation and annexation
3589093 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the twenty first century
3589094 the collective punishment of the population of gaza which has been instituted for months now has failed
3589095 the intriguing thing is someone went to such trouble to do this for a stranger
3589096 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3589097 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be the biggest environmental disaster of all time
3589098 its not going backwards it is actually recognising that we are with nature not against it we have gone working against nature for too long
3589099 it is a political document it is an agreement of principles and i think we have full coincidence of principles
3589100 there are any number of opportunities for russia to reverse course and to demonstrate that it is trying to behave according to 21st century principles
3589101 but i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3589102 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3589103 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3589104 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3589105 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3589106 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3589107 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political
3589108 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3589109 the increase in oil and commodity prices is damaging corporate profits
3589110 its very hard for the boj to move despite the increase in prices
3589111 the boj is concerned about the downside risks to overall economic activity the boj cannot raise interest rates at the same time it cannot cut the policy rate
3589112 iphones get people thinking about smartphones i want to buy them apple a drink
3589113 they mobilise themselves without a need for a central location to do so distribute the targets discuss the attack approaches come up with a plan on the coordination and you have everyone participating
3589114 a bunch of youth groups posted something that was almost a manifesto that called on supporters to wage an information war against georgia
3589115 in the ongoing russian versus georgia cyberwar we have an indication of lists of georgian governmental sites actively distributed across russian web forums
3589116 by posting on blogs and forums instructions that essentially say this is what were going to do but we dont know whos behind that
3589117 georgian hackers or pro georgian hackers launched distributed denial of service attacks against ria novosti
3589118 especially in russia every time something happens there are attacks name any crisis there in the past year and i can point to a spike in attack traffic
3589119 countries visionary enough in the long term sort of tolerate hacking activities unless of course they target the countrys infrastructure in order for the country to later on mobilise them based on nationalist sentiments
3589120 what the attackers learned is that security researchers are actively monitoring their conversations and so in the russo georgia campaign the conversation wasnt happening at the usual underground corners but rather on mainstream forums
3589121 theyve also learned how to better utilise the masses to participate in the attack and that combination of tactics would improve the quality of the campaign
3589122 anyone picking a political fight with russia today can now expect to deal with multiple forms and sources of electronic attack not only from the russian military but also from the russian governments unofficial civilian hacker assets
3589123 a cyberwarfare campaign by russia is seriously disrupting many georgian websites including that of the ministry of foreign affairs
3589124 we developed a chip targeted at performance and then we took two of those chips and put them on one card people have tried to build bigger chips but the problem has been heat and cost its difficult for them to put two on one board because of space and power limitations
3589125 its good to see amd ati back in the high performance game
3589126 the new card looks like it will be able to deliver the goods to high end gamers a lucrative and desirable market moreover amds single card but dual gpu 4870 x2 can if early reviews are on target out perform dual card configurations from nvidia
3589127 the payoff is that this puts amd in an enviable position of having both the highest performance video card and the less expensive solution an experience they havent enjoyed for a while
3589128 im running for president of the united states because i want to help with family values and i think that family values are important when we have two parent families that are of parents that are the traditional family
3589129 people are going to be quite busy with this load
3589130 you can be assured people are using the viewer to share information with partners customers and internally given the popularity of the office suite and how much businesses tend to use access
3589131 given that the vulnerability is web based and graphical you definitely want to pay some special attention to that one
3589132 it allows attackers to invite people for audio or video conferencing by impersonating a victim
3589133 we are looking to make a name and a statement for this team in 2008
3589134 we were really excited to get on the field it has been a month since we were on the field and we have been biting at the bit and tired of practice
3589135 i am very pleased with what we accomplished today we came out swinging the bats well and got a strong pitching performance by jennie right now things are good but theres no time to celebrate
3589136 we have a theme for every game todays was attack attack attack from the very beginning dont wait sometimes we have to wait a few innings before we get going we wanted to get after them the first inning

3589142 i got the ball about 40 yards out and took a touch and just went for it usually i wouldnt take an outside shot but the keeper was off her line and i just hit it good things happen when you take chances
3589143 i think its fantastic that we bounced back from the first 15 minutes against norway
3589144 you look at the first 15 minutes of that game to the last 15 minutes of this game and many things have happened the whole team and myself has gained confidence every minute weve been together

3589178 they are taking so much blood i am going to be very weak before the final of the 100 metres
3589179 he knows about it so its a bit strange he would complain
3589180 hes possibly exaggerating about the four tests but certainly he is part of the program he knows he will be tested more often
3589181 the point is its a good thing if hes been tested a lot
3589182 hes a favourite for the 100 metres so why not
3589183 blood tested once and urine tested once since ive been here
3589184 its what im doing to show my love for my sport
3589185 it comes with the territory past champions have tested positive but an olympic champion needs to carry himself clean to be clean and to be able to prove hes clean
3589186 i hadnt given it any thought until he contacted me and after looking at the old regulations i wondered why anyone would want to go through that

3589205 its still too early to say how thats going to develop though but theres always the potential of a humanitarian crisis and we will just pray that the churches will be ready and able to step into situation like that to help if its needed

3589212 the purpose of this camp is to teach students conversational english and whats excellent about this idea is that people who come over as teachers dont have to be professional teachers to be a part of this camp in fact its better if they dont speak any chinese whatsoever because that forces the chinese students to have to speak english
3589213 we had basic official classes in the mornings but in the afternoons we would have activities with the students during those times is when students would come up to the teachers and get to know them better and the conversation would turn to spiritual things thats when we had the opportunity to share about our personal faith in jesus christ
3589214 the radio is very important in many parts of the world especially in africa putting these kinds of radios into peoples hands not only helps them to hear the message of christ it also gives them some interesting opportunities to make life just a little bit easier

3589230 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3589231 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3589232 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it

3589235 we do not want to believe that the united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
3589236 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
3589237 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored

3589254 in 2006 95 percent of the 60 plus infant deaths are related to unsafe sleep environments
3589255 to claim that there is no chance of an adult overlaying a baby would be irresponsible but so would it be irresponsible to claim that an infant could never be killed while traveling in an automobile

3589270 he administered an enema to himself eight times in one day to the point that some of his intestines ulcerated and an abrasion broke out on him
3589271 he was merry a good devil a good doctor and a very bad author by not reading his books one can be very content
3589272 my mother wanted to stop him from eating that fruit but what the devil kind of harm do you expect it to do to me he ate it leaned his elbow on the table to eat a compote of cherries coughed gently my mother asked him a question since he remained silent she raised her head looked at him he was no more

3589281 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
3589282 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
3589283 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
3589284 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
3589285 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
3589286 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
3589287 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
3589288 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
3589289 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
3589290 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed

3589292 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
3589293 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
3589294 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
3589295 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
3589296 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

3589310 la clave es combatir las causas y reforestar con rboles de hoja perenne especialmente en la precordillera
3589311 look darling this is where i used to live innit cool
3589312 the west coast has really gone off on the hops
3589313 were a little bit more toward an english style we try to cover the range of beers as a brewery you try to cover the range as much as you can
3589314 the steelheads run by us three or four times a year good fishing
3589315 its a really good style its an in between style its certainly not a stout its dark but its light feeling its not heavy like a stout it has a smoky character but not too much
3589316 you cant see through it thats really well balanced its not too roasty not too chalky
3589317 it has a very strong malt character and hop balance
3589318 the malts make it more palatable too you dont burn your palate on the hops the alcohol is pretty well masked which makes it very drinkable
3589319 the red is a good malty red but we use west coast hops so it has that american feel to it
3589320 it has a very nice aroma with the caramel malts
3589321 the citrus hops work very well with a very heavy malt background
3589322 there are so many beers out there everybody is looking for something special and unique it makes it very much worthwhile we work really hard here
3589323 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3589324 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3589325 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3589326 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3589327 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3589328 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political
3589329 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3589330 born out of the daily frustrations of trying to stay up to date with all the important news headlines that surround wall street and the rest of the financial world
3589331 the site is much more innovative convenient and easier to use than the typical and quite boring yahoo and google finance
3589332 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3589333 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3589334 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3589335 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3589336 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3589337 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political
3589338 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3589339 one thing these ratings are lacking is an overall rating at this stage of the game eas still tweaking the game and its ai which affects the overall ratings to the point where theyre not ready to be confirmed
3589340 i think any bloke whos honest about their lives can point to times in their lives when theyve got it wrong
3589341 i know what he would have done if i left he would have partied too thats what i wouldve wanted him to do so thats what i did with some friends
3589342 i wasnt really thinking there would be someone driving by with a video camera on the roof filming me either
3589343 vier menschen haben einen grausamen tod erlitten warum ist noch unklar
3589344 es sieht nicht so aus als ob die frau dazugeh rte
3589345 im tense about it because ill be lying awake worrying about it all night
3589346 its been three years and i need to get back in here
3589347 the tourist areas of town have been open for business for a long time
3589348 but getting people back into hard hit neighbourhoods is one of the challenges we still face
3589349 people wont come back unless there are jobs for them while companies arent going to move here unless there are people to work for them
3589350 the worst affected are people in the lower income brackets who dont know how to navigate their way through the system where the rules seem to change from day to day
3589351 unfortunately this is a state program and i simply cant get rid of all the bureaucracy
3589352 but i can streamline the processes and tighten deadlines to make the program run faster
3589353 this will not be a city of half a million people again for a very long time for new orleans the best way forward is to let go of the past and look to a different future
3589354 new orleans has all its eggs in one basket and we need to move away from that
3589355 we have to give people a reason to come here
3589356 if we show them the neighbourhood is alive and we are pursuing a path of sustainable development that is a step in the right direction

3589364 i just dont have a choice we simply dont know what type of swelling there would be or if there would be any residual effects the next day once you start wheeling and dealing on the knee

3589370 f r uns war die teilnahme am wettbewerb eine art marktforschung
3589371 its been a rollercoaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident
3589372 you play for pressure you play to have all the games count
3589373 ever since i was a little boy i wanted to be in the world series that hasnt happened to me yet when i go to boston i feel like theres a legitimate chance for that to happen this year
3589374 im not lucid right now im saying funny things give me a half hour and ill talk
3589375 i was shocked because i figured after i cleared waivers a couple weeks ago nobody wanted me
3589376 its going to take some adjustments i was throwing my blue indians socks in a box and a guy said they wear red socks over there
3589377 this trade is more about clearing room to give some of our other players an opportunity giving paul a chance with a contender and providing us some payroll relief
3589378 it just seemed like the right time to add this kind of stabilizer
3589379 you never want to get caught short on starting pitching in august and september because theres very little you can do about it
3589380 was an opportunity without dipping into our farm system to add a veteran starter we can trust
3589381 everything has been done out in the open i have a reputation i do not want the fans of cleveland or honest caring people to think that i cheated
3589382 i wasnt a red sox fan this offseason put it that way
3589383 it will take a quick adjustment but im eager to play for terry francona and with a talented team with a chance to win it all
3589384 quimporte que ce soit un prologue ou une course en ligne il ne fallait pas que la rosa soit la seule quipe de l le ne rien remporter cette ann e

3589400 we need to be on the offense in more effectively selling our area
3589401 and we cant view this parochially we have to see what we can do for each other
3589402 this would be another tool for us to attract industries and opportunities for work here
3589403 but we need someone who can react quickly and close a deal
3589404 we should take it one year at a time to see how it progresses

3589452 denise says it is a declaration of war explosive stuff a national security issue thinks the book should be withdrawn asap
3589453 ive never been involved in a game like that before as a pro going wire to wire with no penalties or turnovers
3589454 those are the two things that stand out to me about tonights game and thats what we continue to emphasize around here winning edges
3589455 thats something our line takes a great deal of pride in keeping our defense fresh
3589456 converting on third and 1 is like making a statement tonight was nothing i havent seen from michael bennett before he just works hard and doesnt complain hes consistent and before you know it hes going to give you that big run
3589457 everyone in this room already knows how good michael bennett is
3589458 hes fast hes strong and hes got good vision fundamentally this was a very good game for us no penalties or turnovers thats what you want we didnt do the little things that get you beat in this league
3589459 we got into a good rhythm and when other guys came in they did a great job too
3589460 we had a good running game going tonight were going to watch the film today and there will be a lot to build on i thought we looked pretty good out there
3589461 it feels good to say i played my first game as a pro
3589462 just like i expected the speed of the game in the nfl is a lot faster
3589463 you really wont know until you sit down and watch the tape but id say it was ok
3589464 its only one game but our line has taken an extra step
3589465 we kept converting on short yardage tonight and we did it convincingly where you dont even have to bring out the sticks to measure
3589466 they were all young last year and they kind of got thrown into the fire and did really well now theyre a year older and adding jeff faine at center really helps the offensive line should be one of the strong points of our team all season long

3589500 its been versatile over the seasons but we keep the rock thing for her and it truly works

3589532 the police fire pension fund is the 800 pound gorilla in the room
3589533 everyone knows its there everyone knows it needs to be addressed
3589534 we need to see if there are ways to eliminate or reduce our obligation by eliminating other services
3589535 if were spending money on less important services then we need to stop doing something in order to put that money toward solving this problem
3589536 the thing that concerns me the most is that city staff feels beat up by the media attention and other things that have gone on
3589537 we need to take a look at that and get more focused on what we want to do we have limited financial resources
3589538 if you look at what is required right now you are hiring the ceo for the city
3589539 this issue has had a long and interesting history but the outcome speaks for itself in finding a win win solution for all parties involved
3589540 this decision is a great result for hutt city residents the boulcott golf club and all ratepayers in the wellington region
3589541 i would like to echo the thanks to hcc from our councillors for coming to the party with a good contribution that has enabled this to be a positive decision for everyone
3589542 the level of danger right now in my book would be about a nine and why is because you cant see visibly a crosswalk kids can be crossing anywhere and the chance of a child getting hurt or hit is extremely high right now
3589543 with a crosswalk here you can see that crosswalk all the way up the hill and you know that theres a crossing there so you know you can stop for kids but without that you dont see that so the drivers i think just keep going

3589570 asta e chestia ca atunci cind citesc bloguri sint foarte indulgent pe bloguri nu ma deranjeaza in asa hal greselile de ortografie sau truismele nu stiu de ce poate pentru ca e mai importanta pentru mine autenticitatea
3589571 primarily adult related or too mature for a general audience
3589572 kasi nga maiintindihan ko kung bibigyan ako ng sitcom e kasali ako sa isang sitcom pero biglang host sabi ko bakit ako pinagho host tapos kahit medyo nakakatawa yong pagkaka host iba pa rin talaga siya
3589573 ang sabi naman sa akin madali lang pero hindi mahirap sa hosting pero napagod ako noong first taping day ko ibang iba siya iba ang makipag usap sa camera na alam mo dapat ang sinasabi mo trying to entertain your audience so sana naman magawa ko siya ng mabuti
3589574 iba nakakapagod tawa ka nang tawa ano ka pasigaw iba yong hosting no tapos isa pa sa mga pinu project ko dun is kapag may mga nangyayari gusto ko may ibang adlib talaga na para sa akin comment ko talaga yon marami marami akong pinaggagagawa na nakakapagod
3589575 happy ako dahil sa akin ipinagkatiwala ng gma 7 ang show na yon di ba
3589576 sana hindi ko naman sila ma disappoint im doing my best im doing my best para ma entertain ko yong mga tao sa pagho host
3589577 when i got the script serious ang drama sabi ko kay direk mac alejandre direk mac gawin natin iba gawin nating parang ano love to love up to some extent kikiligin ka kahit papaano may kikiligin ka di ba para iba naman kasi lahat ng gay role ko puro screaming fag loud ito hindi lalaki na in love sa isat isa
3589578 normally i do mga bading roles mga once or twice a year lang kapag tv di ba ayaw ko rin namang mangyari yon
3589579 pero sa susunod na magbading ako hindi ko na lang gagalingan di ba ang pangit naman noon di ba
3589580 it depends on what kind of offer i will get what kind of projects i will not be sexy for the sake of just being sexy i will not do that kasi kung kailangan at sinabi na mag topless ginagawa ko naman basta okay okay sa akin
3589581 basta hindi lang maging pangit sa reputation ko hindi lang maging pangit sa career ko ayaw kong magmukha na ginagawa ko na lang yon para mapag usapan ayaw ko ng ganun basta kailangan gagawin ko
3589582 matagal pa yon lalo na mas maganda na ang katawan ko ngayon o baka may iba pang dumating
3589583 i just take it day by day im 24 and happy naman kami sa kung anong meron kami ngayon pero siyempre you have to stable in all aspects spiritually financially everything
3589584 sana siya im praying for that sana siya na talaga
3589585 hindi ko kailangang magmakaawa sa inyong lahat para sabihing may talent naman ako

3589588 all that the father gives me will come to me
3589589 usually kasi tito boy parang kung ano yung wala ka yun ang gusto mo yun ang gusto mong malaman kung anong meron doon i feel blessed to have a family that i have siguro a lot of the things na meron ako ngayon o mga pinaghirapan ko ngayon o binibigyan ko ng sipag or you know something that i worked on hard i can say na i have what i always wanted to have so kung anuman merong dumating sobrang blessing
3589590 double triple five times ten times more pressure yung nararamdaman ko ngayon five times more pressure pa yung nararamdaman ko ngayon like for example napanood ko yung vtr ng lola ko elaine cuneta nung sinabi niya na sana mas mabigyan ako ngayon nung katulad kay sharon
3589591 thirty years niya her mom lahat pinaghirapan yon first time ko pa lang ngayon tito boy and nakaka pressure talaga
3589592 i think im working pretty hard i like the work i love the work i dont like it i love it
3589593 how hard do i love or how hard do i fall
3589594 how hard do you fall i fall very hard im in deep crap i got into trouble ah mahilig kasi akong magmahal e
3589595 dati gusto kong mag ang tv pero yun ang pinaka first dream ko nung bata ako
3589596 yung buhay ko naman kasi parang pelikula siyempre may malulungkot side na nakakainis na side that comes with it pero more than anything its a wonderful life
3589597 i dont have yung love unconditional yon papa ko siya gabby kahit anong mangyari kahit 13 years kaming hindi nagkita papa ko siya so i love him because hes my father
3589598 si papa kasi nabigyan siya ng pagkakataon na parang kaming lahat parang ako na pinapanood ng tao through the years yung lahat ng pinagdadaanan niya so nakita siya from binata talaga na typical na lalaki na siguro masasabi nyong maraming chicks or something
3589599 ngayon na meet ko na rin yung wife niya si tita ginbee yatco and yung sister ko sa kanya
3589600 and then si dad kiko naman sobrang committed siya sa lahat ng ginagawa niya and yung desisyon niya pinag iisipan niyang mabuti
3589601 he spends time with his family with the kids he has a lot of ano advice to give yun naman yung talagang nakita ko kung ano yung meaning ng naghahatid sundo rin kasi siya yung nagsusundo sa school sa akin dati
3589602 at saka hindi rin madali for anyone na siyempre nung pinakasalan niya yung mom ko may anak na 11 years old so alam kong hindi yun madali para sa isang lalaki malaking bagay sa akin yun and im very thankful na siya mismo ang nagturo sa akin kung ano ang pagmamahal kasi parang hindi nga madali and the more i get older the more na nare realize ko na yung capacity niya para magmahal sobra
3589603 there will always be one sharon cuneta i look up to her and siya yung inspirasyon ko talaga all the time ang dami kong natututunan from her and sana kung anuman yung mabibigay ko right now sana ma accept ng tao magustuhan ng tao and sana maging open sila na maibahagi ko sa kanila kung anuman yung natutunan ko sa kanya
3589604 isang gabi actually morning na biglang may pumasok sa kuwarto ko natutulog ako that time and akala ko panaginip parang may nagsasalita na something like ganyan ganyan ganyan kahit anong mangyari itago mo yan huwag mong wawalain and then biglang narinig ko sumara na ang pinto
3589605 pagkagising ko akala ko talaga panaginip lang pag tingin ko sa kamay ko nandun na yung ring when i looked inside its an important ring form the past pero its the reason here why im here it reminds me na kahit paano sa pelikula kahit papaano meant ako na nandito ako ngayon and its a wedding ring ng mom at papa sharon and gabby nung 1984
3589606 dad i love you penge ring wedding ring ninyo ni mom para dalawa para kasali ka rin
3589607 ako rin nag aabang well sana pero kung hindi siguro may rason din kung bakit hindi nangyari siguro maganda privately muna kami magkita kita abangan na lang po natin
3589608 nanonood siya ng pba sa bahay and pag nakikita niya akong pumapasok sa kuwarto actually pinipilit lang ata siya ng lola ko pero pinapatay niya yung tv para panoorin akong kumanta tapos ayan meron siyang tiyani na gusto niya every each hair na matatanggal ko sa chin niya may barya
3589609 i love you i love you pa ang cute cute ng baby sister ko thank you for visiting me in tagaytay i always love you
3589610 dad for 13 years na naging anak mo ako at naging dad kita thank you sa lahat ng natutunan ko thank you thank you for the unconditional love
3589611 mita dahil po sa kanya nandito ako ngayon gustung gusto na niya na mag artista ako pero galit na galit si mama dati mita salamat sa training mo hawak hawak ko yung mga brush mo tsaka mga rollers mo yan ang mike ko dati ngayon mita o tunay na
3589612 im living my dreams and sana maging proud din siya sa akin siyempre and kung anuman yung binibigay sa inyo ni mom na pagmamahal and ang daming achievements sana ma equal ko yon sana maging proud siya dahil at least naging kumpleto ang pamilya ko
3589613 i will not be here without you everything that i do its because you inspires me ikaw talaga ang gusto kong mapanood all the time and you are who you are i just look up to you you have done so much and by example have taught me a lot sana kung ano ang namana ko sa iyo sana maganda ang kalabasan
3589614 hindi ko kailangang magmakaawa sa inyong lahat para sabihing may talent naman ako

3589640 hindi ko kailangang magmakaawa sa inyong lahat para sabihing may talent naman ako
3589641 okey naman kami ni mart oo aaminin ko nagkaroon kami ng something ni mart noon pero ayon na rin nga sa lie detector test mas matimbang pa rin si aljur
3589642 oo nagseselos ako nagseselos ako sa mga babaeng malapit sa kanya kasi si aljur aminin natin guwapo talaga siya at maraming nagkakagusto sa kanya kaya hindi maiiwasang hindi magselos at saka talagang hindi ko siya pinapansin kapag nagseselos ako
3589643 actually bago matapos ang araw sinisigurado kong okey kami nilalambing lambing ko rin siya siyempre makikita mo yun mararamdaman mo sa mga mata niya nangungusap
3589644 wala lang ine explain ko lang sa kanya na wala naman talaga na sa kanya lang talaga ako nakatingin
3589645 grabe hindi ko nakeri yun kami ni marky naging close kami sa zaido siyempre kami kami ang magkasama pero walang something walang ligawan never kaming lumabas text text pero text lang na magkaibigan
3589646 actually si marky best friend ko napakabait na survivor kaya may tiwala ako sa kanya
3589647 sanay naman na kami mag kissing scene kaso sabi ni direk don cuaresma mag rehearse daw kami
3589648 okey naman yung nag rehease kasi ang goal nga pakiligin ang mga tao so natural naman na lumabas at mas maganda
3589649 hindi ko kailangang magmakaawa sa inyong lahat para sabihing may talent naman ako
3589650 siyempre ano e hindi lang siya happiness parang nagiging source of joy for the moment hindi lang siguro for the moment pero matagal siyang magli linger kasi its a movie na halos walang naniwala sa amin
3589651 actually ako ha to be honest on a personal note hindi ako ma convince that we can make this work its not sarah maybe the story sobrang typical ng story e boy meets girl girl meets boy mayaman mahirap how can you make it work e sa panahon ngayon dapat lahat ng bago mai offer mo e yun pala ang kailangan ang kailangan lang pala ng audience ay isang lumang formula kumbaga saan ka huling nakakita ng movie na kumakanta ang audience di ba yun lang parang nakakatuwa na hindi pa pala nawawala sa audience na naghahanap sila ng ganoon
3589652 they are incomparable yung mga nakita mo sa one more chance hindi mo siguro maaasahang makikita yun sa a very special love malayo sila
3589653 ako ewan ko hindi ko alam its one project mahirap pang magsalita kung kaya na nating magsalita ang success naman nito ang laking part din ni sarah honestly hindi ko alam kung kayang gawing basis yun
3589654 nag side trip man ako from the love team naging successful naman track record wise ang ganda ang saya pero ayoko siyang isipin na parang puwede ang sarap din namang isipin na baka kaya ko na pero siyempre youre only as good as your last project
3589655 hindi ko pa alam pero kung may follow up siyempre hindi mawawala yung mga sabi sabi pero sabi ko nga sana huwag muna kasi nakakatakot dalawa lang ang ine expect ng mga tao its either mapantayan or malagpasan kapag hindi nagawa either of the two ibig sabihin you failed so nakakakaba pero sabi ko nga kung magkakaroon man ang gusto kong gagawa same team ni direk cathy garcia molina
3589656 kasi yung mga title mararamdaman mo lang sa promo pang promo lang yata yan
3589657 ako kasi i dont mind the title i dont mind the labeling of other stars pero siyempre ako marami pa kong kailangan matutunan
3589658 hindi rin naman ako confident kung bigla na lang akong mag full blast sa heavy drama so in this way nakakatulong sa akin nagbe benefit ako dahil natututo ako nagkakaroon ako ng experience ang labeling at pagbibigay ng title wala sa utak ko yun ang gusto ko yung career path na gusto kong magawa at maabot
3589659 well it would be nice kung magawa ko muna yung movie ko with ate vi vilma santos tuloy na siya hinihintay lang kung kailan magsisimula pero tuloy na tuloy na ang project
3589660 yun ang wala pang balita nasa kamay nila yun wala sa akin hanggang ngayon nasa itaas pa nasa kamay pa nila ang bola sabi ko nga at the end of the day whatever task they have given you gagawin at gagawin mo
3589661 ill be happy to be working again with bea new director new set of people sabi ko sa yo ang trabaho kapag tiningnan mo ayoko ng trabahong yan ngayon pero hindi mo alam ang mga nakapalaman sa trabahong yan baka yun ang mas importante
3589662 hindi ko kailangang magmakaawa sa inyong lahat para sabihing may talent naman ako
3589663 the end result is something very new and very different our strength in it security will remain but our business has transformed into a broader based technology provider that still retains our niche customer experience
3589664 highlighting the unified technology solutions that we now distribute we call this unified value distribution
3589665 this is something that everyone needs to consider now there is also a lot of focus on distribution costs which means you have to look at the sensible products to take on and the costs association that comes with that
3589666 unified communications is really starting to engage this year security is not going away nor is storage you also have to secure your storage and the switches around all this involves networking too
3589667 diversification is great but you have to be careful with the speed in which you do it
3589668 you cant do it too fast you need to get the capabilities at the moment we need about eight more staff before the end of the year largely in sales
3589669 hindi ko kailangang magmakaawa sa inyong lahat para sabihing may talent naman ako
3589670 hindi ko kailangang magmakaawa sa inyong lahat para sabihing may talent naman ako
3589671 noong time na yun kasi bago tawagin ang pangalan ko nagre reminisce na ako yung pinagdaanan ko
3589672 yung sa umpisa pa lang ng auditions hanggang sa competition na mismo lahat ng mga sakripisyo talagang nagpa flashback na lang siya sa mind ko pati yung mga taong i have worked with sa gma 7 sobrang na touch ako sa naitulong talaga nila sa akin
3589673 i stopped nga for this mabigat sa loob ko yung sakripisyong yon pero alam ng parents ko isa rin ito sa mga pangarap ko sa buhay ang ganitong opportunities minsan lang talaga dumarating
3589674 para sa judges it can be too emotional so kailangang ilagay ko sa tama
3589675 sa voice quality iba talaga ang voice ko kung ikukumpara kina jayann at ram ang voice ko is husky but i can still hit high notes more on husky side na parang jaya sabi nga nila yung boses ko raw panlalaki mababa ang register pero kayang mapaglaruan para tumaas
3589676 pianist ang father ko and at the same time a politician mayroon din siyang pangarap e sabi niya magre retire na raw siya so ako na lang ang magpapatuloy sa dream na yun buong pamilya namin mahilig sa music
3589677 siguro preferred lang ni kid ang rock ayaw niya siguro sa soul at ballad e yun ang ginagawa ko ganoon na lang siguro yun
3589678 kung pamimiliin ka naman kasi dalawa na lang yung pipiliin mo and i guess its kids opinion lahat naman may opinyon
3589679 wala rin naman silang magagawa kung maraming tao rin ang nagkakagusto sa akin respetuhin na lang sana nila yung paniniwala ng ibang tao
3589680 dyusko ano ba yan may talent naman ako hindi ko kailangang magmakaawa sa inyong lahat para sabihing may talent naman ako narating ko naman ito siguro dahil i have shown my talent
3589681 nang mag join ako rito alam ko nang mabi bring up ang ganyang issue lalo kung marami ang sumusuporta sa akin sa text votes my dad din kasi is a politician at alam natin kapag ganyan may impression na sa politicians pagdating sa kampanyahan parang gagamitin lang ang powers para makuha yung gusto pero naipapakita ko naman ang magagawa ko at ang talent ko kaya siguro marami rin ang sumusuporta naipapakita ko naman kahit paano di ba
3589682 hindi ko kailangang magmakaawa sa inyong lahat para sabihing may talent naman ako
3589683 ito muna talaga yung tema namin just like the first one that we did puro mga cover songs lang din ang ginamit namin secondly eto rin yung madali nang gawin e kapag existing na yung mga songs youll just have to sing it your own way your own version at saka yun na nga convenient sa akin lahat ng mga ito somehow familiar songs so it would be easier for me to record it
3589684 nagsimula kami actually nung late last year then we finished when i got back here lahat ng recording dun ginawa tapos meron lang little curing na ginawa namin dito
3589685 since it did good why not do another one ano rin naman e wala rin naman akong bagong album so might as well do it you know tsaka hindi naman talaga ako laging nandirito hindi ako permanente rito it would be nice if theres something they her fans can listen to while im not around
3589686 it will come soon hopefully next year you know when im not that busy
3589687 hopefully babalik kami ng october with another casino we just cant tell kung ano yon
3589688 naka break kami nung natapos kami sa flamingo nag tour na lang muna kami ng society of 7 umikot ikot muna kami hanggang sa mahilo kami
3589689 umikot ikot kami sa u s nagpunta kami ng atlantic canada marami kaming shows sa west coast so pagkatapos nun eto na nandito na ako para magpatuloy yung utak ko na nagtatrabaho
3589690 if not okay lang yun lang its not something na talagang pinagpupursigihan ko good reviews doesnt really sometimes it really takes a lot of luck just like what happened to charice and arnel pineda of the journey you know theyre like youtube wonders you know sometimes maispatan ka lang ng ganung tema youre on your way hindi pa nangyayari sa akin e
3589691 alam mo sa totoo lang ayoko talagang mag expect hindi ako yung taong eto ang gusto kong gawin tapos hindi nangyari madi disappoint hindi naman ako yung klase ng tao na pag merong bagay na hindi nangyari sa akin e madi depress na ako kung may mangyari why not
3589692 kung hindi man mangyari meron pang ibang magagandang bagay na dapat kong tuunan may iba pang mga bagay na puwede ko pang gawin
3589693 sa ngayon tinutuunan ko talaga tong album na to hanggat nandirito ako pero ganun pa man e kasi dun las vegas ako nakatira e dun kami nabubuhay ngayon e hindi ko maaaring iwan kung ano yung ginagawa ko dun
3589694 isa pa lang yung anak namin ng husband ko noon pa man nag usap na kaming mag asawa kasi actually ako yung laging nagsasabi kay noli her husband noon na ako yung nagpu push ng idea na nakikita mo ba yung sarili natin na magpatuloy ang buhay natin sa ibang lugar
3589695 sabi ng husband ko bakit mo sinabi yang idea na yan wherein mahusay ang buhay natin dito sa pilipinas maayos naman tayong pamilya meron naman tayong bubong sa ibabaw ng ulo natin
3589696 hanggang sa malaki na yung dalawa naming anak it was actually middle of 2002 na nagbabalak na talaga kami kumbaga nag give in na siya sa idea ko na manirahan na sa ibang bansa and we were looking at canada as a place to migrate to
3589697 ako yung time na yon sabi ko okay na na experience ko na yung ganitong klaseng career nalaman ko na kung anong klase yung ganitong buhay na naging isang singer naging isang recording artist naging isang concert performer sabi ko i guess this is enough
3589698 kasi lumabas lang naman ako sa music industry dito sa philippines ng 1997 really really late
3589699 and then nag ano na nga kami ng mga papers ready na talaga kami we were already ready hanggang sa we had this phone call na late 2003 there was an invitation for us to go the u s and see a show sa las vegas there was an offer sa aming mag asawa for a business sa u s magmula noon parang unti unti nang nag iiba yung course nung tina travel naming mag asawa hanggang finally we found ourselves in america instead of canada
3589700 ano pa lang kami doon magpa five years pa lang kami e di ba doon kailangan mong mag ano ng five years bago ka mag apply ng citizenship e wala pa naman kami limang taon magli limang taon pa lang although resident kami doon
3589701 so hindi ko talaga masabi na babalik ba ako dito in a matter of two years or three years hindi ko masabi but kung babalik ako dito malamang yun yung time na mga retiring age na kaming mag asawa ang sama ano
3589702 you know what bakit ka naman hindi mag iisap ng retirement kung may sapat ka nang pera para masuportahan mo yung ano kasi alam mo sa amerika lahat dun kailangan mong i prepare yung sarili mo for your retirement e
3589703 so youll never know malay mo pumalpak yung economy ng amerika wala rin naman akong pupuntahan kundi dito but then again sa ngayon okay ang buhay namin dun
3589704 dapat to nangyari na to nung 2003 i think siguro we were busy actually siya yung talagang matinding busy ako rin naman although what makes me busy naman kasi hindi lang naman career ang inaasikaso ko i still have my personal life to attend to
3589705 this is really something im very excited ano to ito yung im pretty sure hindi naman sa nagbubuhat ako ng bangko pero ito yung something na alam kong inaabangan ng mga tao
3589706 isa yun sa magandang part na somehow pasasabikin namin yung mga tao dun sa u s muna mauna bago dito sa pilipinas
3589707 hindi ko kailangang magmakaawa sa inyong lahat para sabihing may talent naman ako

3589717 it has been able to very cleverly use the flawed australian self regulatory system to maintain its dominance in the market this linked with astute financial management is delivering results that many other telcos can only dream of
3589718 this new environment will generate a completely new range of business opportunities but like all other incumbents telstra with its legacy of old system telecoms networks was not well positioned to participate in this new environment
3589719 it is not only an enormous technological undertaking it also involves a complete change of culture staff is confronted with a massively disruptive learning curve middle management in particular is on a very difficult course
3589720 the people element of the transition is the most difficult to manage many of these middle managers are near retirement age and may not be keen to embrace the new world
3589721 with that vision established the company is putting an infrastructure strategy in place that has ftth as an end goal totally independent of any nbn very significant fibre investments are already being made under the companys normal maintenance program
3589722 in the three years since the discussion began regarding an nbn the amount of fibre in telstras network will have very significantly increased and it would not be too difficult for the company to fairly quickly switch on a half way house known as fttn

3589737 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3589738 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

3589774 we are looking at every strategic option for the iden network including improvements investments partnerships or divestments
3589775 saying they want to sell it is one thing somebody wanting to buy it is another
3589776 i think they are stuck with it they wanted to merge and now they are really merged
3589777 the company decided to cancel the offering because the terms being offered were not economically attractive due to unfavorable market conditions
3589778 it was probably also due to market reaction to its equity
3589779 i never worry about omar because i know how bad he wants to get back to practice
3589780 he doesnt want to get behind because there are some younger guys in that receiving corps who wont mind getting the chance to catch some balls in practice
3589781 omar is the type that doesnt really say hes hurt
3589782 im going to hold the job down until he gets back but i know its going to be sooner rather than later
3589783 one day brian will look good and then the next it might be tienne
3589784 its a chance to let these young guys get in game like situations and see how they respond
3589785 we are not really worried about positions because we feel we can go in there and do the job no matter what position we are in
3589786 i just feel like our tempo and our togetherness as a team will take us past a lot of teams that we play
3589787 everybody is together and theres no upperclassmen against the lower classmen or anything like that thats a big part of any team having that togetherness

3589796 now more than ever it no longer make sense to perpetuate a system that requires or permits terminating carriers to apply different rates for different traffic based on arbitrary distinctions

3589799 in light of the public safety communitys support for revised rules the commission believes that voluntary remand and vacatur of the order would serve the interests of justice
3589800 the commissions motion is an appropriate course of action at this juncture and for that reason rca did not object to the relief requested by the fcc
3589801 rca looks forward to working with the commission and the public safety community to ensure that any revised e 911 location accuracy standards adopted by the commission are well reasoned and serve the intended purposes
3589802 quite frankly 4g represents a great opportunity for us because we see that as capacity expansion higher data rates imply capacity expansion not just combining speed and download capability
3589803 so i think overall we see it as kind of wait and see and if market trends shift and change then thats something that will be easily accessible to us
3589804 i think the world is going there the world phone will be a reality
3589805 i think youll see some interesting developments here over the next six to twelve months
3589806 youve got to go out there and make the most of your opportunities
3589807 a lot of times you only get that one shot so youve got to take advantage of it the overtime gave a lot of us guys more of an opportunity to show what we can do
3589808 its kind of tough to get into one with limited carries but you get out there and you get as many carries as you can and you start to feel a little more comfortable
3589809 all you can do is go out and do the best you can and hope for the best you have to do something spectacular to be a starter obviously you know theres a price you have to pay you have to work hard to get what you want just having patience and keeping a good head about everything is the best way to go about it
3589810 a guy that comes in undrafted he played a season or two in nfl europe and now hes having great success if you want it bad enough youll stick at it and do what you have to do to make it
3589811 hes a young guy who has got some quickness and has pretty good vision
3589812 i look at it like im still at the bottom right now because thats the best way for me to go about it
3589813 if youre still on the bottom you know you have a lot to fight for i dont want to get complacent saturday was a great game but i have to put that behind me and look forward to this week

3589818 hes just a good solid football player whos got an edge to him in a good way
3589819 he gets knocked around a lot and just kind of plays with some reckless abandon you just wonder how he plays as recklessly as he does but thats what makes him special
3589820 surgery is reconstructive so its about a year of rehabilitation
3589821 its like an acl tear so i would have probably just be getting back now or maybe not even until the season started
3589822 you wake up in the morning and you feel it
3589823 if you get hit on it obviously youre going to feel it thats about it its always going to be there but its not always going to be killing me
3589824 i think he really was in line to have a good sophomore season and that knee injury set him back and of course he didnt have a lot of time to heal up we had to get him back out there because he was one of our better players
3589825 but hes one of the all time tough guys he sets a great example for the rest of those linemen when you see him in there you know that hes playing with a lot of pain and discomfort but hes just another one of those guys that you cant run out of the lineup
3589826 there are a lot of guys when youre on the field you just look around and you feel good about having them out there with you
3589827 you get a certain level of comfort when you look over and see that because you know youve got a tough guy on the field with you
3589828 i said to myself that looked a lot like no
3589829 when you hear it from a guy like mr dorsett it touches you
3589830 there will be only one tony dorsett and thats why its such an honor that tony took the time to personally pay tribute to leseans accomplishments
3589831 he is one of the greatest running backs to ever play the game
3589832 walking past his retired jersey every day my teammates and i know the high standards he set at pitt
3589833 comparing him to me no he is lesean let him be lesean
3589834 actually i dont see anything from last season that reminds me we won it all
3589835 thats last season we are focused on this next season
3589836 right now i dont have the trophy around here in the office and all i see are notes and things about this upcoming year im just trying to be ready for our boys to get going in practice
3589837 we have so many guys committed who just want to win and win the right way
3589838 i dont think its going to change the way we go about training and go about playing the games i think within the team we have a lot of leaders who want to do things the right way and the coaches will keep us on track
3589839 weve had about eight months now since our last game in cary and we had a great spring season and even a better summer together
3589840 i think well be ready for that thats attached to us now
3589841 i know for the team its kind of the same its back to work
3589842 people who knew genna and steve you almost didnt know that something was wrong
3589843 we thought shed be the female lance armstrong and would beat it
3589844 as bad as it was for her we thought she could beat it
3589845 you see the pictures and you see guys hugging steve and his sons are in the background
3589846 everybody was asking if youve come off your high but in life heres somebody who is like a brother to me having to bury his wife a few days after we won it thats reality
3589847 you play for pressure you play to have all the games count
3589848 ever since i was a little boy i wanted to be in the world series that hasnt happened to me yet when i go to boston i feel like theres a legitimate chance for that to happen this year
3589849 everything has been done out in the open i have a reputation i do not want the fans of cleveland or honest caring people to think that i cheated

3589860 im probably as guilty as anyone of not giving nascar enough credit for all of the safety initiatives they have introduced to our sport in the last five years
3589861 ill tell you all it takes is to be involved in an accident like we had at the end of the race at watkins glen to send you a reminder
3589862 there is no doubt this is the safest race car in the world we dont think of road courses as places where hard wrecks like that can occur but everything in the car worked like it was designed to do
3589863 i appreciate nascar bringing safety to the forefront and keeping it there

3589876 they have been together since the itunes festival but not many people knew about it only their close circle of friends and family peaches dad knew about the wedding and he is perfectly happy

3589896 leroy is definitely one of the best hes got the right combination he hits with tenacious power he runs to the ball he can blitz he can cover
3589897 it wont always be pretty but we can do it
3589898 a lot of stuff julian makes look easy but for leroy it just is easy anything you go from coverage blitzing open field tackling hes that good

3589900 everybody has an ability they excel at and thats what makes us a good group
3589901 im blessed to play with these guys and learn from them
3589902 but weve got two big names and theyre the two

3589905 but every time i have to open it up for him it gets done
3589906 lofa and i tell him were going to continue to rag on him until he gets his first three interceptions

3589909 obviously you want it to happen but well see what happens
