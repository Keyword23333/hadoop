2140234 early policy decisions of the amya board guided the skippers of radio controlled yachts to register their boats with the organization and to have written class rules and a class secretary as requirements for establishing a class of boats for amya sanction
2140235 in winter of 1970 71 the amya president designated ralph newman of clarence ny to head up the effort for the star 45 by spring 1971 the position was transferred to h whitney pete cutler of brookside nj

2140238 from amya model yachting 7 spring 1972 throughmya model yachting 17 winter 1974 the class underwent fairly consistent growth with the 20 boat minimum reported as being reached in fall of 1972 and class size varying between 15 and 33 boats until fall of 1974 during this period there was one event held by the mid ohio stormbirds in which a star 45 was reported as sailed no other events for star boats were announced in model yachting and no class column appeared in model yachting which undoubtedly contributed to the lack of organized competition and the lackadaisical growth pattern over the period

2140242 the 1975 accr was competed for by a 7 boat fleet in springfield virginia
2140243 class population had grown to 44 boats by spring of 1975 and the 1976 accr was scheduled for july 18 1976 at lake alcyon pitman new jersey under the stewardship of the tristate model yacht club

2140245 by the end of 1977 amya had ceased publishing class population statistics partly because the manual record system made it difficult and partly because some thought that showing small class numbers somehow would reflect poorly on classes that werent growing
2140246 published class records are sketchy until model yachting 41 fall 1980 reports a 9 boat accr won by bill rader who was to become class secretary a year later in model yachting 44 fall 1981 the class secretary reported that 200 stars had been registered since 1970 but the number of current active skippers on the amya roles was not given

2140401 thariqah jalan hidup nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dimana beliau shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan para shahabat berada di atasnya yang selamat dari syubhat dan syahwat
2140402 ahlus sunnah itu orang yang mengetahui apa yang masuk ke dalam perutnya dari makanan yang halal
2140403 tidak diragukan bahwa ahli naqli dan atsar pengikut atsar rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan atsar para shahabatnya mereka itu ahlus sunnah
2140404 mereka pada mulanya tidak pernah menanyakan tentang sanad ketika terjadi fitnah para ulama mengatakan tunjukkan nama nama perawimu kepada kami kemudian ia melihat kepada ahlus sunnah sehingga hadits mereka diambil dan melihat kepada ahlul bidah dan hadits mereka tidak diambil
2140405 siapakah ahlus sunnah itu ia menjawab ahlus sunnah itu mereka yang tidak mempunyai laqab julukan yang sudah terkenal yakni bukan jahmi qadari dan bukan pula rafidli
2140406 mereka para ulama menamakan ahlul jamaah karena jamaah itu adalah ijtima berkumpul dan lawannya firqah
2140407 pada hari yang di waktu itu ada muka yang putih berseri dan adapula muka yang muram
2140408 adapun orang orang yang mukanya putih berseri adalah ahlus sunnah wal jamaah sedangkan orang orang yang mukanya hitam muram adalah ahlul ahwa wa dhalalah
2140409 jika sampai khabar kepadamu tentang seseorang di arah timur ada pendukung sunnah dan yang lainnya di arah barat maka kirimkanlah salam kepadanya dan doakanlah mereka alangkah sedikitnya ahlus sunnah wal jamaah
2140410 jika dikatakan ahlus sunnah maka yang dimaksud dengan mereka itu adalah asyariyah dan maturidiyah
2140411 ketahuilah bahwa pokok semua aqaid ahlus sunnah wal jamaah atas dasar ucapan dua kutub yakni abul hasan dan imam abu manshur al maturidi
2140412 adapun al firqotun najiyah yang terpilih adalah orang orang yang rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam berkata tentang mereka
2140413 ahlus sunnah adalah abu hasan dan abu mansyur al maturidi dan orang orang yang mengikuti jalan mereka berdua mereka berjalan di atas petunjuk salafus shalih dalam memahami aqaid

2140415 in legal terms copyright governs the right to make copies of given work
2140416 the u s copyright act states that a copyright exists once an original work of authorship is fixed in any tangible medium of expression from which it can be perceived reproduced or otherwise communicated
2140417 while the digitization of creative works has expanded the options for consuming copyrighted material copyright owners have begun to exploit similar technological developments to control those options
2140418 people have long been able to photocopy texts tape record music and videotape television shows such leakage as copyright lawyers call it has existed since the first day a reader lent a copyrighted book to a friend with the rise of digital media the leak threatens to turn into a gush
2140419 once something is released into tangible format or copy capable format rest assured it will get copied

2140423 effs investigation revealed that this land is your land appears to have been in the public domain since the early 1970s
2140424 when you buy or for that matter steal and idea that first took form in my head it remains where it grew and you in no way lessen its value by sharing it on the contrary my idea becomes more valuable since in the informational space between your interpretation of it and mine new species can grow
2140425 the continued enjoyment of technological progress and productivity gains from the manufacture of that equipment is linked to the satisfactory resolution of digital copyright disputes

2140433 i appeared at a unity breakfast and supported the winner of the primary judy topinka the 2006 primary was not perfect but it was reasonably clean and fair
2140434 this time andy mckenna thought he could get away with a crooked primary and he was right
2140435 i repeat what i said during the primary steve sauerberg is a joke and an embarrassment to the republican party and to the people of illinois
2140436 loyal republicans called me on election day because of their frustration and exasperation at being unable to get a straight answer from sauerberg on basic issues of human life
2140437 i had no answer for mike psak when he asked me why republican leaders were intent on rigging the primary and denying him a first time candidate a fair chance to run for office what sin has psak committed that he should be degraded and locked out of the primary process
2140438 if my life stands for anything it stands for truth for ethics and for constant battle against corruption of the public trust
2140439 because my life has been about truth telling integrity and honoring the public trust i am not able to forfeit those ethical precepts and my personal integrity to support what i know to be a crooked cabal that corrupted the republican primary and continues to undermine the republican party
2140440 the emperor caligula made his horse proconsul of rome and the mckennas father and son combinecrats all made steve sauerberg a candidate when manifestly he is not
2140441 i will not stand by in silence and bless this corruption and perversion of the public trust with a profane profession of unity
2140442 the doctor who said he was going to bring illinois values to washington has ended up capitulating to moderate values at pbs in manhattan before any votes are cast on tuesday
2140443 sunday february 3rd on the ultra liberal now program on pbs had sauerberg confessed he is a moderate not a conservative
2140444 nine months ago i called sauerberg slippery steve because of his slipperiness on abortion gun control and other conservative issues
2140445 now sauerberg has admitted he is not a conservative at all but merely a democrat moderate running as the combine candidate in the republican primary on the eve of the primary election slippery steve has abandoned republicans once again
2140446 which supporters will he betray next second amendment sauerberg should be required to wear a warning label before he appears at any future republican functions
2140447 i am the only serious viable republican candidate in the primary
2140448 sauerberg is not a republican hes a mckennacrat combine candidate who has been anointed to be the designated loser for dick durbin other than running for the senate what has sauerberg done over the prior 25 years to show he is a conservative republican nothing
2140449 the governor is obviously taking this legal challenge to his authority very seriously
2140450 for many years rick pearson of the tribune has had a very unnatural obsession with me
2140451 judge palmer is just another crooked fixed cook county judge who is manipulyed by the sonnenschein law firm
2140452 the illinois supreme court was very angry at me because as a law student i worked to successfully remove two judges on the court for taking bank stock bribes in the ray klingbiel roy solfisburg bank stock caper
2140453 rick pearson wont tell his readers the truth about me but i will tell the internet the truth about him the rumor on the street is pearson takes money to slant his stories
2140454 i did not run for congress in 1986 and mr pearson is aware of that truth i have testified under oath but pearson prefers to publish the same old lies and in the past wgn tv has also been used as a conduit for pearsons slime
2140455 pearson is known as a stooge of the billionaire mckenna family and the republican party and he is a valet of the combine that corrupts and controls chicago politics
2140456 pearsons latest story was prompted by my radio advertising openly attacking the combine for the first time in illinois political history the combine is terrified of my campaign
2140457 when andy mckenna pulled his dirty endorsement maneuver in december he did not tell any of the legitimate media only pearson was advised of mckennas scheme
2140458 pearson does correctly quote me as stating i am very proud of the enemies i have made because i have relentlessly and successfully exposed corruption and arrogance in our federal and state court systems
2140459 as i have done in the past i treated mr
2140460 in the meantime i promise the people of illinois that we will win on february 5th and we will remove both mckenna and pearson from their malignant positions
2140461 i spoke to the attorney for the cbec moments ago today wednesday and he seemed surprised that the changes which he premised were not in effect

2140487 the chicago board of election commissioners cbec sent out hundreds of thousands of postcards showing voters how to use finger voting
2140488 then they told their employees to have voters use a stylus to avoid the fixed votes programmed into the machines
2140489 in any other city newspapers would be full of editorials criticizing such lassitude and corruption breathless tv reports would question the fraud etc
2140490 for forty years i have been fighting election fraud in illinois and working to end corrupt voting in chicago i will keep fighting for good government and reform even if the media want to bury the story
2140491 on february 6th everything changes we are going to end combine control of the election process
2140492 it is time for mr sauerberg to bring down the curtain on his catastrophic and cadaverous campaign for office
2140493 we now see a recurring pattern of deception in his behavior
2140494 originally sauerberg proposed a health plan which on closer inspection was not a health plan at all
2140495 sauerberg then told the sun times he wanted to abolish medicare
2140496 sauerberg advocated converting medicare into a welfare program where means tested recipients would receive vouchers similar to food stamps
2140497 the deceptive pattern which is now evident is that sauerberg has repeatedly professed to be protecting the public while in reality and on closer inspection he was actually advocating and advancing plans that would strip the public of basic protections in our current health care system
2140498 what remains to be asked is why did the sun times change its internal headline on a published sunday story from sauerbergs advocacy of favors end of medicare to its revised web site of favors health insurance vouchers
2140499 is there a conflict of interest because some members of the sun times news group endorsed sauerberg is the newspaper chain trying to avoid embarrassment we have a full blown media crisis on our hands but the tape will resolve the question of who said what i say release the tape
2140500 republicans are naturally suspicious of the print media but i have never seen the kind of print media deception and distortion that has occurred in the way liberals have tried to portray sad sack sauerberg as a serious candidate for the nations third highest office now we have a highly respected newspaper changing headlines and clarifying reports by one of its reporters it is time for the sun times to come clean or leave the impression that its own staffer dave newbart misrepresented sauerbergs views i dont think that is the case truth will tell
2140501 i think the media are trying to sell republican voters a designated loser a pig in a poke for dick durbin to roast in november

2140511 the time is right for our conversations to address sustainability
2140512 composition becomes a different kind of service discipline serving as a reminder of the conditions of our students neighborhoods jobs and cultures as well as an indication of their hopes and fears for the future
2140513 academic discourse can be such a placeless discourse the constant flow of monographs and articles and papers so many composed as if by disembodied entities detached from any specific locale
2140514 who we are and what we have to say is in so many ways interwoven directly and indirectly consciously and unconsciously with our local environs
2140515 looking into the near future is something owens considers an essential component of sustainability based thinking
2140516 the flaw rests in the fact that the in junction to think globally act locally proposes a false gap between cognition and behavior
2140517 need to explore the relationship between the local and the global

2140523 the combination of learning how to look experimenting getting feedback from technologies interacting with audiences and having the tools for revision taught me something to construct visual meanings and compositions with confidence this is what good learning practices are supposed to do engage us in an exploratory process that allows us to experiment
2140524 visual rhetoric like verbal rhetoric is a system of ongoing dialogue among rhetors audiences and dynamic contexts
2140525 critical dialogue with other students with the teacher and with like minded foks in cyber space
2140526 teach students to look critically and reflexively at media forms and to conceive of themselves as designers of their own histories and cultures this kind of approach to pedagogy both acknowledges the fundamental role that technologies play in our understanding of critical literacy and drives the use of new communication technologies toward student centered learning goals

2140538 i worked for and was inspired by u s senator paul douglas who wrote most of our basic consumer protection laws banks were powerful then but today they have become even more powerful and increasingly exert a stranglehold over congress
2140539 banks are so powerful they got senator hillary clinton in a kerryesque turn of phrase to admit in a recent debate that she voted for a bankruptcy reform law she hoped would be defeated banks forced through a bankruptcy reform law that was engineered to prey on the most helpless in our society victims of uninsured and unexpected medical bills bankers have become ghouls not the warm and fuzzy organizations featured in their ads

2140577 if you ask leaders in anbar or people whove lived in baghdad they will tell you that they have great memories of the village i honeymooned there or took my family there youll hear this resounding message over and over again
2140578 the feeling among the investors was pretty good some of them either got married or honeymooned there and they really had a feeling that this is important to the iraqi people and very much want to be a part of iraqs revitalisation

2140705 pendekatan multikulturalisme ini sangat penting dikembangkan agar kita tidak mengalami kehilangan orientasi dan kebingunan eksistensial dalam menata kembali pluralitas budaya dan agama inti dari multikulturalisme adalah kesediaan menerima kelompok lain secara sama sebagai kesatuan tanpa mempedulikan perbedaan budaya etnik jender bahasa ataupun agama multikulturalisme memberikan penegasan bahwa dengan segala perbedaannya itu mereka adalah sama di dalam ruang publik multikulturalisme menjadi semacam respons kebijakan baru terhadap keragaman dan komunitas komunitas yang berbeda itu diperlakukan sama oleh negara
2140706 multikulturalisme memberikan nilai positif terhadap keragaman kultural konsekuensi lebih lanjut adalah kesediaan untuk memberikan apresiasi konstruktif terhadap segala bentuk tradisi budaya termasuk agama berbagai kultur yang beragam justru memperkaya kehidupan sosial tentu sebaliknya agama juga menganggap keragaman tradisi kultural memperkaya pemahaman keagamaan
2140707 dalam upaya membangun hubungan sinergi antara agama dan multikulturalisme minimal diperlukan dua hal pertama adalah mengembangkan keberagamaan humanis posdogmatik keberagamaan yang menembus sampai pada dimensi hakekat atau esensi beragama secara individual beragama tujuannya untuk mencerahkan diri sehingga kedamaian sejati terus bersemayam secara sosial bertujuan untuk mewujudkan kesejukan ketentraman dan keharmonisan bersama untuk ini diperlukan reinterpretasi atas doktrin doktrin keagamaan ortodoks yang sementara ini dijadikan dalih untuk bersikap eksklusif dan opresif reinterpretasi itu dilakukan sedemikian rupa sehingga agama bukan saja bersikap reseptif terhadap kearifan tradisi lokal melainkan juga memandu di garda depan untuk mengantarkan demokrasi terbangun dalam masyarakat beragama dalam masyarakat multikultural yang memprasyaratkan adanya kesalingpahaman satu bentuk budaya dengan budaya yang lain keberagamaan humanis posdogmatis lebih menguntungkan ketimbang sikap keberagamaan yang menekankan pada simbol simbol kekerasan kebencian hujat menghujat dan kafir mengkafirkan banyak faktor yang menyebabkan terjadinya hal yang sangat patut disayangkan itu yang di antaranya adalah faktor teologi diharapkan melalui tulisan singkat ini dapat menggugah kita untuk mengembangkan pendidikan tersebut di kalangan umat yang mau tidak mau harus melakukan transformasi menjadi masyarakat demokratis

2140719 untuk itu seharusnya orang tua tidak memberikan penyedap rasa pada makanan yang dikonsumsi serta membatasi anak anak untuk membeli jajanan di luar
2140720 bahkan susu formula saja yang mengunakan dha dan dhhhha itu juga menggunakan penyedap rasa buktinya anak anak biasanya tidak akan mau kalau susunya diganti dengan susu merek yang lain
2140721 jika tidak bisa dihindari sebaiknya konsumsinya dikurangi atau setelah memakan makanan yang menggunakan penyedap rasa sebaiknya langsung mengkonsumsi bawang putih atau penetralisir lainnya

2140730 when you go through an lbo a leveraged buy out like the one performed by silver lake you have 4 5 years to treble your value
2140731 my expectation is well exceed that four year customer count in the first year
2140732 those ten customers have all been pulled in through telesales but as we ramp the business so were going to be dealing with larger implementations
2140733 larger customers are going to go saas that is going to be an enterprise value sale thats going to have to take place
2140734 the biggest problem for conventional software vendors and probably why burtons former employer oracle isnt going saas is that initially a big hole appears
2140735 people shy away from putting that cash to work in building a saas business because of the effect itll have on the stock price

2140747 tidak ada isteri bagi non yahudi mereka sesungguhnya bukan isterinya

2140892 he pipped me a couple of times but only because i had nasty cramps
2140893 you cant rely on luck in the olympic games i think its our duty to the nation keep him out of the team
2140894 well you could clip his heels and then if that doesnt work i could elbow him off the track
2140895 blimey the selectors must be scrapin the barrel if theyve picked two slow coaches like you
2140896 bloomin brilliant thats one gold medal for britain in the bag

2140914 alf my boy ive been forced into it you know the orphanage playing field weve been renting that piece of land for 25 years but now the owners putting it up for sale and a big business man wants to get his paws on it to build a factory the owner says we can have it for five thousand pounds but all we have to spare is one thousand then somebody mentioned that the bookmakers were offering odds of five to one against you winning the greystone mile and like an idiot i bet our thousand pounds on you
2140915 the bookie wont give it back if a runner scratches from a race the money is lost
2140916 i hate people betting on races it makes folks greedy runners have been known to be nobbled or bribed to lose you get gangsters involved and no end of trouble athletics is a sport not a blooming business

2141555 i got involved with project uplift my freshman year back then you couldnt become a volunteer without partnering with someone older unless you were at least a sophomore but i attending the training session interviewed and picked out my little sister when i was a freshman that way i was able to meet lele right away my sophomore year and truly get involved in the program as early as possible
2141556 i have always enjoyed children but helping kids that have had it tougher than most really touches my heart when i heard about project uplift through friends i knew immediately i wanted to get involved
2141557 lele and i work on her homework a good bit we always have dinner together she loves to play outside or on my computer at the disney web site weve had a slumber party that was super fun weve carved pumpkins and celebrated halloween weve gone to surf side water park you name it and weve probably done it
2141558 lele has taught me to be strong you really cant imagine what all a child can handle and especially so well shes been through a lot but shes still happy and smiling all the time shes taught me to be thankful for everything ive been given you never know how lucky you are until you see someone that has to struggle like youve never had to and just like being with any child shes taught me patience
2141559 i hope that ive shown lele how to be a responsible caring adult i try to be a stable source of love and help in her life when she gets in trouble at school i try to tell and show her that she cant act like that but that there are other ways of handling our frustrations and temptations
2141560 the benefits in our program are not just for the children the kids get another or sometimes their only source of affection and someone they hopefully look up to the volunteers learn what its like to have someone need them they learn how to deal with children i hear people say a good bit that theyve learned how blessed their own lives have been and to boot volunteers can get class credit letters of recommendation and a wonderful program to gain experience from
2141561 as for working in the project uplift office ive learned exactly what all has to go in to run a program like ours there is much red tape that has to be walked closely beside and much work that has to be performed to make sure everyone is happy and given all they need to benefit from this experience ive definitely learned that non profit may be the hardest line of work out there but probably the most rewarding
2141562 i would encourage others to get involved because there are many children just in our area alone that need effective role models a ton of children are barely getting by and they need our help not only does volunteering help the one getting the attention but it also affects the lives of those giving parts of themselves to others at the same time
2141563 there are so many wonderful things about project uplift if i had to name one thing its the fact that everyone involved in the program honestly wants to help the lives of less fortunate children all of the staff is so caring and work tirelessly to provide the best they can for the children and volunteers involved every volunteer that ive ever met gives a great deal of themselves to their little brother or sister its not always easy working with these children every case is different and everyone has a lot on their plate but the volunteers ive seen interacting with their kids are very loving it looks like theres no where else theyd rather be
2141564 if you are interested please take the next step and attend a training session i hate hearing people say they dont have enough time for our program everyone is busy but when you see how little it takes to brighten a childs day its totally worth it
2141565 if people knew this beautiful site was here they would come and see it

2141576 we have failed to comprehend that the result of the technology that originated in the years of the arms race between the soviet union and the west has resulted in using satellite technology not only for surveillance and communication systems but also to lock on to human beings manipulating brain frequencies by directing laser beams neural particle beams electro magnetic radiation sonar waves radiofrequency radiation rfr soliton waves torsion fields and by use of these or other energy fields which form the areas of study for astro physics since the operations are characterised by secrecy it seems inevitable that the methods that we do know about that is the exploitation of the ionosphere our natural shield are already outdated as we begin to grasp the implications of their use
2141577 it is easily conceivable that some russian satan or lets say iranian or any other satan as long as he owns the appropriate means and finances can inject himself into every conceivable computer network into every conceivable radio or television broadcast with relative technological ease even without disconnecting cables and intercept the radio waves in the ether and modulate every conceivable suggestion into it

2141657 honest officer i just wanted to see how he glittered up his gun
2141658 thank you for letting me read your novel i stayed up till nearly midnight reading it i must admit i found the first chapter a bit unbelievable that someone could be so pathetic but then i was hooked and read it at one sitting im not saying you can rival jk rowlings who is apparently charles dickens reincarnated but i see no reason why your novel should not be published
2141659 well when i first read your synopsis i admit it sounded a bit like countless other romantic type novels but i have to say i was pleasantly surprised the basic story is pretty simple but imo you did manage to make it more interesting by bringing samanthas past and problematic youth into it i feel it is this part that makes the book more interesting to read than others of the genre i think you did your best writing in transmitting the emotional push and pull between samantha and pierre this is clearly your strength as a writer
2141660 i have just finished reading your lovely book and i must say that i enjoyed it very much i think that you have a wonderful plot and that you built your characters beautifully i loved the way and i think that i said this to you after the first 80 pages that you got my interest straight away i also loved the way that you built the tension both from the safety angle and also the romantic angle all in all a great story all in all i think that it is a great book and i laughed quite a few times and cried a couple thank you so much for trusting me with this and i feel confident that this will be the first of many good stories that you get published
2141661 what can i say its hard to believe you are a novice writer or should i say rather an unpublished writer you are certainly no novice i love the way the characters and plot unfold through the book you have a flair for allowing information through at the right time not all at once i am not just saying this because you are a vt pal but because i have huge respect for you as an artist you are so creative if a publisher turns this down i think he she needs a trip to specsavers and ill pay the 10 charge it is inspiring and i am privileged to have read it at this stage of its history well done i wish you all the best with your writing going from strength to strength this book proves you have what it takes and more
2141662 well what can i say other than i really enjoyed it it would be a book that i would say to my five sisters i have just read a real good book by a woman author called elodie you should buy it and read it and no youre not borrowing mine
2141663 i enjoyed your novel and couldnt wait to see what happened next all in all id have paid to read the darn thing so you did great
2141664 im 3 4 of the way through your book and i love it it really sucks me in to he point that i feel that i am there do you know what i mean thats the difference between books and films your imagination can help fill in the spots for you job well done girl my teacher days have found a few grammar errors but hey who cares you are on a winner
2141665 the reports were especially disturbing in ohio the critical battleground state that clinched bushs victory in the electoral college officials there purged tens of thousands of eligible voters from the rolls neglected to process registration cards generated by democratic voter drives shortchanged democratic precincts when they allocated voting machines and illegally derailed a recount that could have given kerry the presidency a precinct in an evangelical church in miami county recorded an impossibly high turnout of ninety eight percent while a polling place in inner city cleveland recorded an equally impossible turnout of only seven percent in warren county gop election officials even invented a nonexistent terrorist threat to bar the media from monitoring the official vote count

2141674 wahai ibu allah telah menyembuhkan penyakit putramu dan kini ia sudah dapat melihat kembali semua itu berkat doamu yang tiada henti hentinya
2141675 saya telah mengunjungi syam mesir dan jazirah masing masing dua kali ke basrah empat kali menetap di hijaz mekah dan madinah selama enam tahun dan tak dapat dihitung lagi berapa kali saya mengunjungi kufah dan baghdad untuk menemui ulama ulama ahli hadits
2141676 ketika muhammad bin ismail dating ke naisabur aku tidak pernah melihat seorang kepala daerah para ulama dan penduduk naisabur memberikan sambutan seperti apa yang mereka berikan kepadanya
2141677 barang siapa hendak menyambut kedatangan muhammad bin ismail besok pagi lakukanlah seebab aku sendiri akan ikut menyambutnya
2141678 pergilah kalian kepada orang alim yang saleh itu ikuti dan dengarkan pengajiannya
2141679 barang siapa berpendapat lafadz lafadz adalah makhluk maka ia adalah ahli bidah ia tidak boleh diajak bicara dan majelisnya tidak boleh di datangi dan barang siapa masih mengunjungi majelisnya curigailah dia
2141680 adalah kalam allah bukan makhluk sedangkan perbuatan manusia adalah makhluk dan fitnah merupakan bida
2141681 iman adalah perkataan dan perbuatan bisa bertambah dan bisa berkurang adalah kalam allah bukan makhluk sahabat rasulullah saw yang paling utama adalah abu bakar umar usman kemudian ali dengan berpegang pada keyakinan dan keimanan inilah aku hidup aku mati dan dibangkitkan di akherat kelak insya allah
2141682 barang siapa menuduhku berpendapat bahwa lafadz lafadz adalah makhluk ia adalah pendusta
2141683 lelaki itu bukhari tidak boleh tinggal bersamaku di negeri ini
2141684 aku tidak akan merendahkan ilmu dengan membawanya ke istana jika hal ini tidak berkenan di hati tuan tuan adalah penguasa maka keluarkanlah larangan supaya aku tidak mengadakan majelis pengajian dengan begitu aku mempunyai alas an di sisi allah kelak pada hari kiamat bahwa sebenarnya aku tidak menyembunyikan ilmu
2141685 di antara ciptaan tuhan pada masanya imam bukharilah agaknya yang paling bijaksana
2141686 aku menulis hadits yang diterima dari 1 080 orang guru yang semuanya adalah ahli hadits dan berpendirian bahwa iman adalah ucapan dan perbuatan
2141687 saya hafal hadits di luar kepala sebanyak 100 000 buah hadits sahih dan 200 000 hadits yang tidak sahih
2141688 hadits pertama yang anda kemukakan isnadnya yang benar adalah begini hadits kedua isnadnya yang benar adalah beginii
2141689 yang mengagumkan bukanlah karena bukhari mampu memberikan jawaban secara benar tetapi yang benar benar sangat mengagumkan ialah kemampuannya dalam menyebutkan semua hadits yang sudah diputarbalikkan itu secara berurutan persis seperti urutan yang dikemukakan oleh 10 orang penguji padahal ia hanya mendengar pertanyaan pertanyaan yang banyak itu hanya satu kali
2141690 saya tidak pernah meriwayatkan sebuah hadits pun juga yang diterima dari para sahabat dan tabiin melainkan saya mengetahui tarikh kelahiran sebagian besar mereka hari wafat dan tempat tinggalnya demikian juga saya tidak meriwayatkan hadits sahabat dan tabiin yakni hadits hadits mauquf kecuali ada dasarnya yang kuketahui dari kitabullah dan sunah rasulullah saw
2141691 wahai para penenya saya sudah banyak mempelajari hadits dan pendapat juga sudah sering duduk bersama dengan para ahli fiqh ahli ibadah dan para ahli zuhud namun saya belum pernah menjumpai orang begitu cerdas dan pandai seperti muhammad bin ismail al bukhari
2141692 di kolong langit ini tidak ada orang yang mengetahui hadits yang melebihi muhammad bin ismail
2141693 khurasan belum pernah melahirkan seorang putra yang hafal hadits melebihi muhammad bin ismail juga belum pernah ada orang yang pergi dari kota tersebut menuju irak yang melebihi kealimannya
2141694 biarkan saya mencium kaki tuan wahai maha guru pemimpin para ahli hadits dan dokter ahli penyakit ilat hadits
2141695 andaikan pintu pujian dan sanjungan kepada bukhari masih terbuka bagi generasi sesudahnya tentu habislah semua kertas dan nafas ia bagaikan laut tak bertepi
2141696 setiap bulan saya berpenghasilan 500 dirham semuanya dibelanjakan untuk kepentingan pendidikan sebab apa yang ada di sisi allah adalah lebih baik dan lebih kekal
2141697 perlu dipertimbangkan para ulama meninggalkannya atau para ulama berdiam diri tentangnya
2141698 saya meninggalkan 10 000 hadits yang diriwayatkan oleh perawi yang perlu dipertimbangkan dan meninggalkan pula jumlah yang sama atau lebih yang diriwayatkan perawi yang dalam pandanganku perlu dipertimbangkan
2141699 aku bermimpi melihat rasulullah saw seolah olah aku berdiri di hadapannya sambil memegang kipas yang kupergunakan untuk menjaganya kemudian aku tanyakan mimpi itu kepada sebagian ahli tabir ia menjelaskan bahwa aku akan menghancurkan dan mengikis habis kebohongan dari hadits rasulullah saw mimpi inilah antara lain yang mendorongku untuk melahirkan kitab al jami as sahih
2141700 aku susun kitab al jami ini yang dipilih dari 600 000 hadits selama 16 tahun
2141701 aku susun kitab al jami as sahih ini di masjidil haram dan tidaklah aku memasukkan ke dalamnya sebuah hadits pun kecuali sesudah aku memohonkan istikharoh kepada allah dengan melakukan salat dua rekaat dan sesudah aku meyakini betul bahwa hadits itu benar benar sahih
2141702 tidaklah kumasukkan ke dalam kitab ini kecuali hadits hadits yang sahih dan kutinggalkan banyak hadits sahih karena khawatir membosankan

2142034 toyota motors corporation like many other organizations distribute internal newsletters to foster a sense of community among their employees toyota internal newsletters is for passing information trends and entertaining bits as external company newsletters but with a greater sense of intimacy and perhaps less formality the employees get engaged in some friendly competition by touting top performers in the company newsletter it acknowledges staffs birthdays weddings anniversaries and achievements in the pages of a crisp internal publication it also sharpens teams industry knowledge via useful factoids up to date articles and analytical editorials toyota corporation use newsletters to keep staff and customers informed of current events and happenings within the company
2142035 the study by specialist journal irs employment review found that while organizations do now use an extensive range of communication methods including online systems handbooks newsletters and memos team briefings executive briefing sessions and road shows tended to work best face to face engagement is the critical measure by which organizations are able to inspire and mobilize their people to accelerate reaching company objectives engaged employees are motivated to succeed take pride in their company are committed to the success of the corporation and are extraordinarily persuasive brand advocates the programs are developed in the context of empirical discovery reflected in an employee engagement index

2142039 bulletins can be used to give immediate information to employees that cannot wait for the next issue of a newsletter or they be a substitute for a formal publication if the company doesnt feel that the expense is justified bulletins are useful only if they are distributed quickly and are seen by all interested employees they can simply be posted on notice boards or more effectively given to individual employees and used as a starting point for a briefing session if they contain information or sufficient interest to merit a face to face discussion

2142072 and the shapes of rocks when the sunrise hits them
2142073 about fifteen years ago i was walking here at about this time one morning
2142074 but it was extremely cold and windy it was during the fall
2142075 i had bundled up pretty good but i had not prepared for the amount of wind i encountered at the top it was as if a train had hit me when i passed over the summit freezing coldi it was still quite dark from the clouds and sunrise wasnt for another half hour i had no idea if it would be any easier to go down the way i came so i just kept going this was before cell phones so i knew i was being stupid but it was too late to do anything about that i also was just getting through a messy divorce so the experience of fighting the wind actually felt kind of redemptive
2142076 i walked over the summit and was picking my way headfirst down this bunch of rock steps right here when i felt this weird nausea come on really suddenly i have a strong stomach so i felt confused by it and when the dizziness hit me i went into a kind of shock and couldnt feel my legs i tried to sit down it was happening so fast i cant even tell you how fast this all came on this ringing started in my ears and then a dry pop like a twisted towel flicking my ear drum the ringing became so severe i remember trying to cover my ears
2142077 when for what felt like a minute everything around me was completely lit up like it was high noon it must have been a fraction of a second because i still wasnt even sitting down but everything glowed white it crossed my mind that it was beautiful but it was so terrifying because the shadows of the pine trees were dancing maniacally around my feet and my head was spinning i tried to take a breath when i realized i was suffocating something seemed to press on my chest when i tried to inhale but before i could worry too much about it boom boom ba boom boom
2142078 a bomb dropped or thats how it felt the ground shook which is no small thing when everything around you is solid rock
2142079 how far away from it were you did you see the tree fall
2142080 but then i looked up and saw that the tree was on fire lying on its side and the wind had completely stopped i suddenly felt amazing inside like my life had completely changed in a way i never could have understood then but it turns out to have been true
2142081 well thats another story but the tree burning there and the wind so quiet all of the sudden i just knew everything was exactly as it was supposed to be i didnt even feel cold anymore i just sat down right there on those rocks and enjoyed it like a bonfire a sort of surreal bonfire of course but i felt so good all over my breath seemed to be coming from my feet and my hair felt like it had nerve endings in it as the breeze started picking up again my hair kind of played in it
2142082 no its hard to explain the rain started falling and the wind picked up again and the tree kept burning and i didnt move a muscle i think i sat there for an hour it might have been only five minutes i dont know but i didnt want to leave when i got home i called my lawyer and said i dont need anything from the settlement i just need to move on and that was that
2142083 have you heard anything about the floods that have happened here
2142084 down at the bottom they start in four mile canyon and wash right through here
2142085 in the past sometimes when it rains here huge walls of water come rolling through some people have been caught in it and washed away when i walk here through the rain i wait until its been raining a while in case there might be any flash floods
2142086 just wondering i see you out here all the time want you to be safe have a good one

2142089 disrupting the cyclical processes of nature at an accelerating pace
2142090 maybe not concerning climate and the exotic tulips you have but when it comes to scientific standards and culture there are many similarities that foster the debate on sustainability as well it is open non hierarchic and critical which provides a good basis for cooperation
2142091 people have so much energy commitment and such an enormous willingness to make sacrifices to help and support the diseased friend or relative at the same time i see how we as a humanity on the global scale are destroying our own habitat seemingly not able to work together and care about this global patient the planet we live on
2142092 i see we are embarking now on the next stage of our own development as humanity the core vision and purpose of the natural step reflects what we see as the needs of society as the sustainability debate goes forward there is a pressing need for a more consistent way of dealing with the challenges of sustainable development we need much more competence in all organizations to deal with the complexities of finding sustainable solutions
2142093 people are generally intellectually and emotionally intelligent we are social we have empathy we love our children and we generally want to look forward to something compelling in the future what is so difficult when it comes to sustainable development which is all about applying those inherent human qualities
2142094 the sustainability discussion concentrates on expert knowledge and disagreement and thus a lot on details
2142095 every expert has a lot of information on one specific subject and he or she tends to go more into depth with his or her studies going below surface into drill holes these drill holes of knowledge and information make people drift apart in subcultures of science what is needed is a shared structured overview of what is needed to make full use of the knowledge in the drill holes by connecting them
2142096 mrs anderson is a patient with cancer cancer is the problem which many experts each on their own specialty oncologist surgeon nurse are trying to solve the vision is to bring back health and cure the patient by working systematically together this is what tns tries to achieve with sustainability issues bringing all knowledge together in structured way starting with developing a birds eye view on the problem at stake the vision we hold for the future is a sustainable society what conditions do we need to meet to achieve sustainability
2142097 what shall we do today to get where we want to be tomorrow concerning sustainability this is called backcasting tns is working on the level of principles instead of the level of details because we cannot actually see the future in detail so now when we are backcasting we can systematically move ahead towards a common goal compare working on sustainable development with a game of chess making strategic moves forward playing the game by the basic principles of checkmate and a unified theory you can get to checkmate in many ways and you have to sacrifice some pieces but you know where you are heading you have a strategy and adapt it to new circumstances when necessary every step in the game the goal and principles of the game stay the same
2142098 you had certain principles in mind when you moved there as everybody who is planning to move to a new place and house the principles that guide you are for example about your budget the distance to your working place whether you like a garden or not et cetera you would never screw up your basic principles about where you want to get to and end up in some expensive castle in poland if you want to work in arnhem and you only have a limited budget
2142099 the d is often forgotten because the end purpose is not clear and people tend to choose between two evils but using the a b c d methodology works in practice as shown in the following example about ikea from several years ago ikea wanted low energy light bulbs these at that time contained a considerable amount of mercury which is toxic to the environment but on the other hand the low energy light bulbs use less energy than regular light bulbs ikea asked scientists which of the two was best from a sustainability point of view what would be worse to use more energy or to produce more toxic waste the scientists were equally divided in two groups in their answers but then a business person came along who knew the answer neither he insisted on getting light bulbs that where low in energy use nd low in mercury it turned out that not one of the big companies like philips and osram could do this however a small factory in china turned out to be able to produce light bulbs with only 1 3 of the amount of mercury compared to the others this factory got the job to produce low energy light bulbs for ikea and money to develop light bulbs not using mercury in the future however they were surprised by the request of ikea for they did not have the necessary production capacity to produce in large amounts the big companies started thinking again about the problem because they were not happy about losing the order
2142100 one main thing is using the framework and bringing it to people companies and communities who want to learn about the natural step with the objective of producing and living more sustainable by doing this people can make better use of all the existing tools for sustainability and demonstrate what they are good at i dont go much into debate with people who are not listening or communicating because this takes a lot of energy which is better used to work with people who do want to work on sustainability tns is also engaged in setting up a new research program together with several swedish universities and international partners we call this program real change and it is a proposal for an international trans disciplinary cross sectoral and cross cultural research program its aim is to connect scientific theory methods and applications for strategic sustainable development this means working with scientists from different universities and disciplines and partners from society together sharing the same tns systems approach of sustainability these new forms of scientific and social cooperation are like a flower where the core is sustainable development and the tns framework and the different petals are organizations people and projects working with it
2142101 i do not try to convince people it is a learning dialogue how can we bring together all knowledge on the level of the general principle how can we share the same big picture this is what i like to make clear so that everyone talks on the same level and has the same goal
2142102 we can also give examples from communities in developing countries who worked successfully with tns the generic principles of the framework are the same the framework worked quite beautiful in for example a tribal village in africa the people there after having learned about the science principles and system conditions started singing about it to link it to their own situation and gain a deeper understanding
2142103 hopefully this will change now we dont have the resources to invite people to work for us it works the other way round people have to ask for us and they must have the organizing capacities to set up a new tns office and be able to provide for funding in their country themselves right now tns international is ready to expand and work together with people taking new initiatives

2142112 pada saat yang tepat itu semua dapat dibicarakan untuk mendapatkan penyelesaian terbaik tetap dalam koridor hukum dan keadilan
2142113 meski sebagai manusia dan layaknya pemimpin yang lain pak harto memiliki kekurangan dan kesalahan itu tak menghalang halangi kita untuk memberikan ucapan terima kasih dan penghargaan atas jasa dan capaian beliau kepada negara dan bangsa
2142114 presiden menanyakan kepada ketua tim dokter kepresidenan tentang kondisi kesehatan pak harto ketua tim yang menjelaskan kondisi pak harto membaik presiden tidak menyarankan apa apa tetapi hanya mendengarkan dan meminta terus dipantau secara ketat

2142157 again the verbs form describes someone who continually lacks external evidence of the faith he routinely claims

2142459 dunia ini penuh perhiasan dan perhiasan yang paling indah ialah wanita yang solehah
2142460 ada empat wanita mulia yang juga penghulu segala wanita di dunia mereka itu ialah asiah binti muzahim isteri firaun maryam binti imran ibunda isa khadijah binti khuwailid isteri rasulullah saw dan fatimah binti muhammad puteri kesayangan baginda
2142461 janganlah kamu nikahi wanita kerana kecantikannya kelak kecantikannya itu akan membinasakannya janganlah kamu nikahi wanita kerana hartanya boleh jadi hartanya akan menyebabkan kederhakaanmu sebaliknya nikahilah wanita yang beragama sesungguhnya wanita yang tidak berhidung dan tuli tetapi beragama itu adalah lebih baik bagimu
2142462 perempuan yang solehah mestilah taat dan memelihara kehormatan dirinya ketika ketiadaan suaminya dengan perlindungan allah
2142463 jika seseorang wanita menunaikan solat lima waktu berpuasa sebulan ramadan memelihara kehormatannya mentaati suaminya nescaya dia dapat masuk ke mana mana saja pintu syurga menurut kehendaknya
2142464 mana mana isteri yang meninggal dunia sedangkan suaminya redha kepadanya nescaya isterinya akan masuk syurga
2142465 sebaik baik wanita itu ialah wanita yang melahirkan anak yang penyayang yang memelihara kehormatannya yang mulia pada kaca mata ahli keluarganya yang menghormati suaminya menghiaskan dirinya hanya untuk suaminya tercinta memelihara diri daripada pandangan orang lain yang mendengar kata kata suaminya dan mentaati segala perintahnya apabila bersama suaminya dia memberikan apa saja yang diperlukan suaminya dan dia tidak pula menolak ajakannya serta tidak merendah rendahkan atau menghina kedudukan suaminya di hadapan orang lain

2142483 todays 75 basis point cut in the fed funds rate to 3 50 percent is a very good step in the right direction to boost the economy and send a clear message to both the market and to consumers this strong rate cut will help lower mortgage interest rates and lessen the burden of adjustable rate loans that are resetting in the current environment it also could help stimulate business investment in the wake of market uncertainties we commend the federal reserve board on its bold action but at the same time we urge it to keep a close watch to see if additional action is needed
2142484 the federal reserve made a bold move tuesday by announcing an emergency rate cut but experts predict a tepid reaction in south floridas rattled real estate market which has already shrugged off cheap mortgages over time the feds interest rate cuts should lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses alike sparking economic activity the cost of revolving credit card debt for millions of americans should fall but the rate reductions do little for what ails the u s economy a housing sector in a deep funk and credit markets in turmoil because of uncertainty over who holds how much exposure to complex financial investments in south florida even if the lower rates translate to cheaper borrowing costs on adjustable rate loans not a sure thing the housing market will remain too overpriced for most buyers experts said because the benefits of rate reductions arent felt immediately the full effect of the feds action wont be known for months the immediate effects were psychological helping to put confidence into global stock markets that were in full retreat

2142580 weve heard promises about it in every state of the union speech for the last three decades but each and every year we become more not less addicted to oil a 19th century fossil fuel that is dirty dwindling and dangerously expensive
2142581 the amount of energy that you have to use to get that oil out of the ground is such that it actually creates a much greater impact on climate change as well as using much more energy than even traditional petroleum
2142582 its a meritocracy we are going to support resources that diversify petroleum supplies that bring more production to this hemisphere and that meet our long term obligations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
2142583 and i think its an open question as to whether or not the canadian resources are going to meet those tests
2142584 america imports about one third of its oil from canada and mexico and no one need worry about a reliance on friendly stable neighbours and partners in nafta
2142585 what he wants to do clearly is to eliminate oil sources like the oilsands he is very aware of them and the process thats generating them
2142586 that is a threat to the oilsands and canada has to take this much more seriously
2142587 how are you going to convince me that the carbon footprint is less by developing the oil in iraq and shipping it to the coast and refining it there

2142591 traditionally printers could be a little protective about involving others in their work but i see a great deal of positives in having designers working alongside printers to achieve the best result from a job i think my appointment shows a growing trust in the contribution designers can make to finished print quality

2142595 the clay first deformed as a rubble of blocks and then as these moved their faces had slipped against each other and a continuous surface had formed with many smooth bumps as it passed over the separate blocks in the sliding faces
2142596 the residual strength is something for an engineer to have in mind in site investigation if there is evidence that at some past time there were large displacements of many feet on an old slip surface and it is found now to be a slick surface then the strength must be expected to be much less than cs

2142644 the printing industry is traditionally thought of as being male dominated but these dinners show that there are a number of hugely talented women working in our industry some in very high positions of authority including company owners
2142645 these events give women an opportunity to meet others in the industry often these women deal with each other every day but dont always get to meet in person
2142646 their major role is that they make it affordable for printnz to put these events on and provide quality speakers and entertainment
2142647 the events have been very successful they are a celebration of both our industry and the people that work in it
2142648 those that have attended certainly mark them on their calendars for the following year they are also a great networking opportunity for the suppliers into the industry and give a different point of contact for many businesses
2142649 were trying to create a new phrase because digital printing has a few bad connotations such as the quality is not there or its only used for really short runs these things used to be true for digital printing but they are not true for hyper printing the machine is checking and scanning every print whereas offset has a degree of colour change across a 10 000 copy run
2142650 weve had digital gear in the past but the imagepress is the first time i can say ive looked at a digital machine and thought i dont think i could do that on offset until now
2142651 when i saw the imagepress i saw quality without compromise i didnt see that with the others with this machine you can have your cake and eat it too
2142652 we have invested in a brand new flood coater from cellcoat a leading uk company with over 30 years of experience in supplying laminating and coating machines to the print finishing industry world wide
2142653 the cellcoat roller coater is equipped with the latest on board plc and frequency controlled twin doctor blades to produce smoothly coated sheets without orange peel veins
2142654 it is also fitted with three lamp uv curing as well as an ir oven curing tunnel allowing us to offer a range of new uv and aqueous coated products which can be applied either on one or both sides
2142655 the main advantages for our customers will be that lamatex will be able to offer the one stop shop for all laminates and coatings this will minimise turnaround times as all coating embellishment can be handled under one roof making outsourcing work easier for our clients
2142656 on their arrival to new zealand we treated our guests to a trip out to glenfalloch high country station and lodge which is the base for methven heli ski in the winter we wanted to give our guests a unique kiwi experience and show them what new zealand has to offer
2142657 we want to highlight the success and achievement of companies and keep our industry striving for excellence
2142658 the bar of excellence continues to lift and we have created this new point of difference to give appropriate recognition
2142659 to achieve a gold medal requires excellence and not at the expense of any other piece thus we can have multiple golds in any category
2142660 it is only once a gold has been awarded that there is any competition and that is for the supreme award and by default to gain the best of category we simply want to be able to make each category winner stand out a little more and give them something extra special to celebrate their success
2142661 we are encouraging people to do new and innovative things and to submit entries to be judged as excellent it is all about highlighting the really great aspects and stories from the new zealand print industry

2142817 the minister for the department of environment and climate change decc verity firth needs to act immediately to correct misleading statements made to the media last week by her department
2142818 last week we disclosed that the decc had twice refused our freedom of information application for details of private native forestry property vegetation plans pnf pvps
2142819 the ncec would hardly be wasting our resources engaging the environmental defenders office to act for us in this matter if all the information was on a public website
2142820 last week we saw the premier stand down a minister for not providing accurate information to the public
2142821 minister firth should act immediately to ensure that statements issuing from her department are true she may also want to address the issue of transparency in government her departments assessment that it is not in the public interest for community environment groups to access this information is reminiscent of the way the old forestry commission behaved it is a sad state of affairs that the environment department has now become the problem
2142822 under the now sacked pmh council in principle approval was given for the land so be sold for this purpose however this decision was not made by the council at a council meeting as such it never appeared on the council agenda papers with an opportunity for the community to comment similarly it appears no decision was made by council to delegate to staff the decision to sell the land so the in principle decision may be invalid
2142823 since the news about the proposal broke the community has made it very clear it does not support the proposal and does not support the pmhc selling land to the proponent
2142824 our legal advice is that given there are serious questions surrounding the in principle sale decision the council administrator can withdraw that support
2142825 we understand that the council has also sought legal advice and look forward to them making that advice public
2142826 the community will be able to hear more about this and other reasons that this proposal is unsustainable and unsuitable for the times we live in at a forum organized by the environmental defenders office the ncec and rapp residents against power pollution to be held this thursday the 12 enviro short film competition now closed
2142827 we have grave concerns about the implementation of the private native forestry code of practice by the department of environment and climate change decc
2142828 in just 10 months they have approved 108 492 hectares of forests in nsw for logging
2142829 the grounds on which the department refused the freedom of information request were spurious and very ill considered
2142830 the logging approvals they issue operate for up to 15 years and suspend the operation of the threatened species laws
2142831 decc has made getting a logging approval a tick the box exercise and some areas that were protected under the previous regime are now being opened up for logging
2142832 concerned members of the public have no one to turn to
2142833 logging results in a net loss of carbon from forests
2142834 it seems the department is completely out of touch with the community and think the public has no legitimate interest in this matter
2142835 their health is central to our ability to survive the global warming that is already in the system
2142836 i can only speak in superlatives he meant the world to me i worshiped him i would do anything he said because i trusted him implicitly when i was with him i felt like everything was going to be okay he had a hot line to jesus there was a kind of aura and mysticism about him while others in the church thought he was aloof i felt i was let in to be the chosen he was the center of my universe and my connection to god

2142838 a complete assault of the human not only is there psychic physical trauma but also a murdering trauma of the spirit
2142839 they have betrayed the deepest levels because it involves a representative of god who is our protector lt was a spiritual seduction
2142840 to tell others what happened would be a sin because it would bring shame on the church
2142841 spiritual life used to be as easy as breathing now it takes all my strength to approach god and pray

2142844 to whom do i belong to whom am i obligated to whom am i accountable who do i obey and who do i have to make happy the congregation the chairperson of the board the vestry or my denomination
2142845 i always felt as though somehow the church was supposed to take care of us because we were clergy i dont know where that came from or why but i figured that if i were looking for a job i thought somehow the church would guarantee me a position i believed that i shouldnt be out there all by myself
2142846 karen and i wanted to thank you and your workmen for doing a fantastic job on installing our fence its a great improvement to our property and feel the money was well spent we will vocally recommend you to all of our friends and neighbors

2143077 the ground breaking study from the australian national universitys brendan mackay into the importance of eucalypt forests in carbon storage is good reason to re visit the regional forest agreements
2143078 the state and federal governments review of their forestry agreements are well overdue
2143079 it confirms our view that older mature forests with bigger trees are providing a unique environmental service to the community and the economy
2143080 clearly the ongoing destruction of our high carbon storage forests is madness in the face of melting polar icecaps
2143081 we are calling on the nsw government to include climate change and green carbon storage as part of their review of the integrated forestry operations approvals which along with the rfas dictate how and where logging can occur in our publicly owned forests
2143082 the report also has implications for the private native forestry code of practice where the government rejected our view on the importance of conservation of older forests and the largest trees

2143149 me parece muy preocupante todas las amenazas de grupos terroristas deben ser tomadas en serio y hay que actuar sobre ellas sin embargo lo fundamental aqu es enfrentar el tema mapuche en su integralidad
2143150 no hemos tomado el tema ind gena con la seriedad que corresponde
2143151 normalmente lo que hemos hecho como se ha hecho en todos los pa ses de latinoam rica es que uno se preocupa del tema ind gena cuando esto estalla cuando hay problemas ah se toman dos o tres medidas de emergencia resuelto el problema uno procede a olvidarse de las promesas que se han hecho
2143152 entiende que hay una cantidad de promesas incumplidas a trav s de muchas d cadas y que ellos creen que deben ser respondidas
2143153 lo que queremos es poner absolutamente toda la potencia del estado tras una soluci n integral y puesta en marcha de todos los planes que durante muchos a os se han hecho pero que est n truncos o a medio ejecutar o que no se han ejecutado de la forma correcta

2143169 kesediaan tajol rosli juga memberi ruang untuk perbincangan lebih lanjut di antara pucuk pimpinan kedua dua parti
2143170 cara ini peralihan kuasa sebenarnya menyelamatkan umno kerana dengan langkah ini umno mendapat satu perubahan secara total ini adalah langkah terbaik untuk memulihkan parti
2143171 apa yang diumumkan hari ini melegakan ramai dan bagi pemuda kami nak lihat ke depan kami nak pastikan parti kuat transformasi perubahan yang diperlukan dan lebih penting lagi untuk mendekati rakyat dan menunaikan janji janji semasa pilihan raya
2143172 kami dalam pemuda menyokong dan sekarang pemuda hendak melihat ke depan nak buat kerja nak rapatkan barisan proses pemilihan berjalan dengan biasa dah diharapkan ia berjalan tanpa menjejaskan kestabilan kekuatan dan keharmonian parti umno itu sendiri
2143173 anggota anggota umno perlu bersama sama di semua peringkat bagi memastikan perpaduan diutamakan anggota umno perlu mengelak apa apa sengketa yang berpunca daripada pertandingan dan berpuak puak dalam parti perlu beri kedua dua pemimpin ini sokongan penuh dalam menangani cabaran cabaran yang dihadapi kesan daripada masalah masalah ekonomi global
2143174 umno sentiasa ada tradisi yang baik dalam hal ini ia dapat memberi gambaran yang jelas tentang masa depannya dan juga kepada satu peralihan kuasa yang tersusun pada masa akan datang
2143175 tidak ada apa yang perlu disedihkan atau kecewa ini adalah sebahagian daripada keputusan parti ia adalah sesuatu yang akan mengukuhkan parti
2143176 presiden mempunyai jiwa yang besar dengan menyerahkan jawatan dalam tempoh tertentu dan najib pun ada jiwa besar kerana sanggup tunggu 23 bulan dari sekarang untuk terima jawatan itu beliau sendiri meminta supaya tidak ada pencalonan dilakukan untuk jawatan presiden dan timbalan presiden
2143177 dalam situasi sekarang presiden akan serahkan parti dalam keadaan yang padu dan kompak supaya mudah untuk datuk seri najib menjalankan tugas bila menghadapi pilihan raya umum akan datang
2143178 kalau tak umum macam macamlah nanti orang bercakap terima kasih di atas pengorbanan yang sanggup dilakukan oleh najib kerana menunggu pada masa tertentu saya berharap kestabilan politik akan berlaku dan berharap kedua duanya bergabung untuk menjalankan tugas dengan baik
2143179 inilah yang dikatakan ada satu kesefahaman yang tulen yang tidak palsu diantara presiden dan timbalan presiden kita dan saya percaya ini dapat menyatukan anggota umno untuk bergerak ke arah pilihan raya umum yang akan datang dengan sokongan padu kepada pemimpin

2143181 pada masa sama calon guru lepasan ipta masih dikehendaki menduduki inventori sahsiah keguruan insak dan temu duga walaupun sudah melepasi syarat kelayakan kemasukan seperti ditetapkan melalui ujian inventori pemilihan pendidik malaysia medsi serta temu duga khas
2143182 kementerian pengajian tinggi khususnya pensyarah ipta berasakan proses pemilihan guru ini seolah olah menafikan pendidikan dan latihan diberi mereka yang berpengalaman di fakulti pendidikan
2143183 begitu juga isu membabitkan wakil fakulti pendidikan ipta secara langsung dalam penentuan unjuran keperluan guru sekolah menengah ia kerana pada tahun sebelum ini data pengiraan unjuran pengambilan pelajar kurang jelas tidak meliputi keperluan guru untuk sekolah swasta serta tidak mengambil kira jumlah pelajar tidak memenuhi standard kualiti ditetapkan
2143184 kini hanya universiti putra malaysia upm dan universiti malaya memiliki jumlah purata pensyarah melebihi 30 peratus berkelulusan phd
2143185 kita memerlukan lebih banyak pensyarah sebegini sebagai langkah untuk melahirkan mahasiswa yang berkualiti pada masa hadapan sebagai langkah untuk memenuhi permintaan pasaran pekerjaan
2143186 kita harus memiliki strategi serta perancangan yang berkualiti dalam usaha untuk melahirkan mahasiswa yang berkualiti pada masa akan datang
2143187 melalui seminar ini kita harap dapat melahirkan universiti yang berkualiti setaraf universiti terkemuka antarabangsa
2143188 kita juga akan mengkaji semula sukatan pelajaran di setiap ipta supaya ia menepati kehendak pasaran pekerjaan

2143192 wij zijn een libertair centrum dat links ge nspireerd is maar omdat we gesteund worden door de vlaamse overheid asossieert men ons blijkbaar met separatisme of fascisme en komt men hier een soort kristalnacht organiseren dit is erg verontrustend

2143203 en el caso de este sistema que vamos a crear lo que se asegurar es el derecho a que los pueblos sean informados sobre los proyectos a que los posibles da os que generen los proyectos en las comunidades sean reparados y a que se establezcan sistemas de participaci n econ mica de las comunidades en los beneficios de lo proyectos
2143204 todo esto significa generar reglas del juego para que proyectos de inversi n se puedan hacer con tierras ind genas o adis no implica que no se puedan hacer pero los que logren esta certificaci n van a tener la seguridad como una especie de resoluci n de impacto ambiental

2143315 both cid and cid courses were very challenging with an emphasis placed on good design practices it is an essential qualification for any designer who wants to excel in his field by producing designs consistent with all manufacturing and assembly requirements at all times it is good to know that when a design is passed to the manufacturer assembly house and test department it meets with all the requirements set out by each of these
2143316 it is great to have a qualification to back up the knowledge and skills that i have gained while working at quantum cad while it wasnt easy cid is the first step in becoming an experienced designer and has given me the confidence to take the next step
2143317 the course covered what every pcb designer should know even though the test was multiple choice it was by no means an easy exam the questions were structured and delivered in such a way to test the pcb designers knowledge and experience in their field of pcb design having completed and gained the cid qualification i now feel it will now give me the legitimacy to call myself a professional pcb designer
2143318 there are only 53 pcb designers in the uk who are certified cid which makes it an incredible achievement for martin personally and for quantum cad too

2143389 combined with the availability of financial assistance for pet owners in need los angeles now has the tools in place for successfully ending the euthanasia of healthy and treatable animals
2143390 as with so many important accomplishments this spay neuter law is not the end of the story but rather just the beginning

2143452 saya perhatikan ketika demam bola sepak euro 2008 baru baru ini ramai pelajar yang melepak di kafe francais sehingga awal pagi ini boleh mengundang masalah keselamatan
2143453 jadi saya terfikir kenapa tidak dibawa kafe ini ke dalam kampus dan membolehkan mahasiswa menikmati suasana serupa di dalam kawasan universiti mereka yang terkawal
2143454 jadi pihak ipta kalau hendak laksanakan kena pastikan harga yang ditawarkan oleh kafe francais ini munasabah mungkin dengan mengenakan sewa yang rendah
2143455 if his removal was linked to other reasons besides performance then the name of academics have been tarnished
2143456 some may allow the cafes to open while some may not
2143457 i suggested this earlier as i have noticed many students staying out late at these cafes
2143458 tweety you sister has decided to leave camp and move to la
2143459 she said she was staying here for the summer she said she wasnt moving to la she said it herself why is she doing this
2143460 ok come on back in its time to go back to bed
2143461 you arent by chance planning on quitting camp today and moving to la are you
2143462 and you dont by chance have a pet phyduck that you let out this morning to pee do you
2143463 youre not going to understand the idiosyncrasies of the movie because you don t know the comic book thats half the fun of the movie
2143464 we express our loss of confidence in her as a consequence we question not only her moral authority but also her ability to govern given the mounting garbage of lies and obfuscation that she is constrained to build to cover up the increasing stench of corruption in the government
2143465 we conclude that president macapagal arroyo refuses to serve the peoples demand for truth about a matter of great public interest
2143466 we see in this refusal despite ample chances and many sound reasons a clear basis for our people to find her complicit with and in fact at the center of the corruption and cover up of the nbn deal
2143467 we should not stop with just focusing on one individual the president as senior officials we should look at the system itself which breeds this kind of practice where you have a parallel government where you have government by golf where important decisions are made outside the halls of government outside of formal decision making processes but in golf courses and hamburger joints
2143468 it is easy to point a finger but where is the proof
2143469 having been once holders of significantly high positions in government they should be the first to know that accusations are merely loose talk if not backed by substantive evidence
2143470 from respected government officials now they have simply become rumormongers what a sad turn of events
2143471 we only wonder why they insist on making it appear that the president has not done her share in the search for truth
2143472 by doing the actions we called for the president would have shown her respect for the system of checks and balances of our democracy by cooperating fully with the senate to give our people the full picture of the corruption and cover up of the nbn zte deal
2143473 even as we issued our statement however the presidents spokespersons were summarily dismissing these demands later her advisers even criticized and threatened us for making these demands the president is very poorly served by these spokespersons and advisers
2143474 does not serve the truth if neri still invokes executive privilege and does not testify and if all records of the nbn zte project have still not been submitted to the senate
2143475 has the greatest stake in the senate investigation coming out with the truth or the people will conclude she hides behind lies and uses the power of her office to smother the truth
2143476 we are not going to get united or divided or pulled into the easy black and white distinctions that are being made as to whether it is time she should go or not
2143477 when you say loss of confidence there are specific actions that are taken by the person who has lost the confidence of the governed and we would rather keep it that way we are not here to make threats we express what we think is appropriate for today
2143478 the question about timeline seems to be premised on having a particular goal and the goal that is proposed is the ouster of gloria macapagal arroyo id like to say that the constitution specifies the time when she is supposed to leave which is is the next elections may 2010
2143479 we are not in a position to say this is our timeline because we really have not agreed on how she will leave we all have our different preferences some of us want her to leave immediately others say teka muna wait let us find out the best way for the economy and the people and for the government for her to leave
2143480 i would like to think that the worst is coming
2143481 it will not be interrupted by students going home to the provinces because they will bring back to the provinces what they have learned in the cities
2143482 first of all the worst is not measured only by rallies so let us not dismiss this entire movement as though it were just a question of how many people you can bring together to makati or plaza miranda
2143483 there will be no vacation no letup until the entire truth is uncovered
2143484 when these students go home they have larger audience of ordinary people to whom they can explain what is happening this is not a matter of dissipation by disappearance in metro manila to think that way is to assume that everything is happening only here
2143485 examine their conscience to discern if their continued service in this administration is not in fact helping prop up a regime that at best abets large scale corruption lies and cover ups and at worst is a party to them
2143486 dalil untuk itu tiada bagi allah itu tempat ialah bahawa allah telah

2143493 dan sesungguhnya kami telah menciptakan manusia adam dari tanah liat kering yang berasal dari lumpur hitam yang diberi bentuk

2143496 rabbana saminaa wa athana wahai tuhan kami kami memperhatikan dan mentaati

2143511 tengah memulai untuk mendata jumlah sistem operasi baru walaupun google tidak pernah menggambarkan seperti yang diungkap weiner tak pelak google akan menjadi pesaing microsoft dalam menawarkan level serupa dari fleksibilitas dan kekuatan baik bagi para konsumer maupun pembuat konten
2143512 tunggu sebentar tidakkah orang ini mengerti apa itu sistem operasi
2143513 kebahagiaan bukan datang dari kemampuan menempati posisi hub atau keystone tetapi dari dalam diri sendiri
2143514 kita berharap oracle e business 11i 10 akan dipakai utamanya oleh konsumen konsumen baru
2143515 kita berharap hal ini dapat mengurangi kendala yang selama ini ada dimana oracle bukan pemain penting dalam bisnis aplikasi
2143516 sampai saat ini 80 sampai 85 persen pengguna oracle telah menggunakan e business suite kita mengharapkan mereka akan melakukan upgrade ke versi terbaru
2143517 klien kami kebanyakan menggunakan aplikasi keuangan padahal bidang ini hanya sepersepuluh dari total fitur yang ada dalam aplikasi bisnis oracle
2143518 kami hanya mengimplementasikan 75 persen dari keseluruhan fitur yang ada
2143519 karena mampu menumbuhkan kemampuan yang diharapkan dengan cara yang lebih aman
2143520 sistem ini akan makin mempertinggi kualitas kesehatan para penderita sakit yang harus menjalankan operasi
2143521 sulitnya pada robot adalah menerapkan gerakan pada waktu yang tepat dalam hitungan milidetik agar tidak jatuh
2143522 robot robot itu adalah pejalan kinematis mereka berjalan selangkah demi selangkah dan memperhitungkan setiap sudut setiap milidetik
2143523 namun sangat kikuk manusia tidak berjalan seperti itu mesin mesin besar itu menghentak bagai robot kami mau membuat robot yang berjalan seperti manusia
2143524 dengan sensor warna itu g rush bisa membedakan pearl miliknya dan bukan
2143525 kualitas rata rata peserta juga meningkat robot otomatis kebanyakan sudah bisa jalan kalau tahun lalu kebanyakan masih manual saja
2143526 robot robot yang diciptakan mahasiswa mahasiswa di ajang ini bisa jadi bukti bahwa kita punya sdm berkualitas baik
2143527 pemenang di masing masing zona itu nantinya bisa dikirim ke tingkat nasional dan gairah robotika semakin hidup
2143528 kita harus mengantisipasi perkembangannya jangan sampai bablas sekarang saja korporat sudah mulai menggelar e learning massal seperti garuda dan bi mereka sudah bicara reduce cost bisa tiga kali lipat
2143529 sehingga mereka berpikir lah kita sudah bisa mencari kerja dengan sertifikasi ini
2143530 kalau voip dulunya itu sebenarnya punya regulasi tapi lalu karena ada kontra dimana mana ya jadinya digantung padahal teknologinya terus jalan
2143531 nah nantinya kalau ada apa apa tinggal kita lempar ke komunitas dan mereka pasti cepat melakukannya karena konten e learning kita masih sedikit dan harus dikembangkan seperti konten dalam mem protect material animasi dibuat seperti apa dan yang lain jadi seperti partner goverment lah
2143532 mereka pembelajarannya distance leaning dan sudah bukan antar pulau tapi sudah antar negara negara kecil disana sehingga karakteristiknya mirip dengan kita
2143533 the emerging technologies for teaching and learning a new paradigm of learning
2143534 melihat keadaan ini dan perkembangan tik yang pesat tidak mungkin pendekatan pembelajaran menggunakan cara konvensional
2143535 bayangkan dengan karyawan sebanyak itu kalau pakai sistem pembelajaran konvensional berapa kelas yang harus disediakan belum infrastrukturnya
2143536 untuk menarik karyawan kita beri hadiah misalnya untuk responden terbaik
2143537 kita adakan launching formal agar karyawan tahu bahwa ini hajat perusahaan dan bukan sekedar program dari departemen hr saja
2143538 kalau di bni kami ada learner award dengan hadiah laptop
2143539 nanti kalau sudah berjalan baik ya hadiah hadiah itu dihapus bisa bangkrut perusahaan kalau terus menerus
2143540 banyak faktor yang perlu diperhatikan terutama bagaimana mengubah paradigma atau mindset pegawai agar mereka mau mengakses sistem ini
2143541 umumnya bagian pengembangan sdm perusahaan skala menengah dan besar sudah memikirkan penggunaan e learning secara efektif untuk pelatihan karyawannya begitu pula lembaga pendidikan
2143542 penerapan e learning di indonesia sudah pada taraf yang lumayan dari segi awareness semangat dan penerapan e learning ini semakin bertumbuh di kalangan industri dan institusi pendidikan
2143543 walaupun penerapan e learning di indonesia masih dalam tahap pemula dalam dua tahun terakhir ini perkembangannya sangat pesat

2143654 flour supplied to the market in punjab is cheaper than those given to us because the punjab government has extended subsidy on it the flour given to the nwfp and markets outside punjab is prepared from the wheat which the millers acquire from the open market on comparatively high prices this means that consumers in the nwfp have to pay at least rs1 2 higher than the people of punjab and sindh
2143655 of 2 1 million tons the provincial government only procures 0 25 million tons and leaves the consumers at the mercy of punjab flour mills

2143925 a congregation of faithful men in which the pure word of god is preached and the sacraments be duly ministered according to christs ordinance in all those things that of necessity are requisite to the same
2143926 the view of the cross as the sacrifice for the sins of the world is a barbarian idea based on primitive concepts of god and must be dismissed

2143928 as the church of jerusalem alexandria and antioch have erred so also the church of rome hath erred not only in their living and manner of ceremonies but also in matters of faith
2143929 to ordain any thing that is contrary to gods word written
2143930 enforce any thing to be believed for necessity of salvation
2143931 men who have public authority given unto them in the congregation
2143932 it appertaineth to the discipline of the church that inquiry be made of evil ministers and that they be accused by those that have knowledge of their offences and finally being found guilty by just judgment be deposed

merupakan input dan li dan ri adalah merupakan output chipertext pada setengah putaran pertama input blok rc 5 plaintext dan blok output chipertext adalah l n konsep dasar untuk menganalisa cara memecahkan rc 5 dilakukan dengan dengan meganalisa struktur rutin enkripsi dimana konsep ini berusaha menemukan kunci rahasia dan tabel pengembangan key s proses iterasi yang dilakukan untuk mendapatkan kunci rahasia dan tabel pengembangannya didekati dengan perhitungan l n 1 b pada range 0 b w 1 pada setengah putaran yang terakhir l n terdapat 4 variable dalam persamaan kedua diantaranya r n dan r n 1 hal ini dapat diketahui dari chipertext jika kita mengetahui informasi tentang l n 1 akan membantu bagaimana mengetahui subkey s n yang digunakan untuk proses chipertext untuk mendapatkan hubungan persamaan dari keempat variable diatas terhadap proses rotasi r n 1 mod w pertama kita asumsikan kasus khusus dimana b r n 1 mod w 0 pada kasus ini bit r n 1 b pindah keposisi bot 0 setelah rotasi pada awalnya r n 0 dan r n 1 b diketahui jika kita dapat menghitung l n 1 b selanjutnya dapat diperoleh s n 0 bit yang kurang penting dari kekuatan dari penyandian bergantung kepada jumlah kunci yang digunakan 3 beberapa algoritma enkripsi memiliki kelemahan pada kunci yang digunakan untuk itu kunci yang lemah tersebut tidak boleh digunakan selain itu panjangnya kunci yang biasanya dalam ukuran bit juga menentukan kekuatan dari enkripsi kunci yang lebih panjang biasanya lebih aman dari kunci yang pendek jadi enkripsi dengan menggunakan kunci 128 bit lebih sukar dipecahkan dengan algoritma enkripsi yang sama tetapi dengan kunci 56 bit semakin panjang sebuah kunci semakin besar keyspace yang harus dijalani untuk mencari kunci dengan cara brute force attack atau coba coba karena keys pace yang harus dilihat merupakan pangkat dari bilangan 2 jadi kunci 128 bit memiliki keyspace 2128 sedangkan kunci 56 bit memiliki key space 256 artinya semakin lama kunci baru bisa ketahuan beberapa cara telah dikembangkan oleh seorang pemecah enkripsi untuk menganalisa keamanan block cipher dalam memecahkan chipertext jika sebuah key memiliki n bit kemudian terdapat 2 n kemungkinan key yang akan diuji ketika ukuran key lebih besar dari ukuran blok akan terdapat peningkatan kemungkinan pemecahan enkripsi test statisktik bisa digunakan untuk menganalisa prilakuk blok chipertext blok chipertext yang memiliki tingkat keamanan yang tinggi akan berprilaku seperti suatu permutasi yang random acak dari sebuah key yang random juga jadi dari informasi dengan statistik diatas sangat sulit untuk memecahkan sebuah enkripsi dengan key dan permutasi yang acak kecuali dengan analis yang sangat mendalam rc 5 menggunakan konsep seperti yang diuraikan diatas yaitu memiliki jumlah key yang dapat divariasikan dan jumlah rotasi yang dapat ditentukan untuk mendapatkan tingkat keamanan yang diinginkan disamping itu proses pengembangan key key expansion dilakukan secara acak yang akan menghasilkan key hasil pengembangan yang juga acak key hasil pengembangan inilah yang akan digabungkan dengan plaintext jadi secara statistik sangat sulit memecahkan kode enkripsi rc 5 yang menggunakan jumlah key yang semakin banyak walapun banyak pihak yang sudah berusaha memecahkan algoritma ini pada tahun 1995 kaliski dan yin 7 berhasil memecahkan rc 5 hanya satu tahun setelah dipublikasikan mereka melakukan pemecahan dengan menanalisa struktur dasar rutin yaitu rotasi data idependent pada tahun 96 knudsen dan meier melakukan perbaikan pemecahan yang dilakukan oleh kaliski dan yin dengan menganalisa secara hati hati hubungan antara input dan subkey kemudian pada tahun 1998 biryukov dan kushilevitz melakukan perbaikan konsep pemecahan yang dikemukakan oleh knudsen dan meier mereka mempelajari lebih komplek dan melakukan suatu perkiraan yang umum rotasi data dependent dari enkripsi dan pemecahannya mereka memperkirakan untuk memecahkan rc 5 dengan 12 putaran dengan data 64 bit dibutuhkan waktu penyelesaian 2 dari uraian dan tabel diatas dapat disimpulkan bahwa rc 5 dapat dipecahkan dan membutuhkan waktu iterasi pemecahan yang cukup lama tergantung jumlah putaran yang digunakan seperti yang terlihat pada tabel diatas berdasarkan syarat dibaris kedua dan ketiga semakin tinggi jumlah putaran yang dilakukan semakin lama proses pemecahan dimana jumlah putaran ditentukan saat prose enkripsi jumlah putaran juga menentukan tabel pengambangan key yang digunakan jadi semakin banyak jumlah kata kunci dan putaran yang digunakan maka semakin lama waktu yang dibutuhkan untuk memecahkan enkripsinya dan tingkat keamanan semakin tinggi algoritma memiliki keuntungan keuntungan dalam implementasinya hal ini dapat digunakan oleh pemakai untuk memilih atau sebagai pertimbangan dalam memilih menggunakan rc 5 5 keuntungan keuntungan yang dimiliki rc 5 adalah sebagai berikut rc 5 menggunakan metode enkripsi simetrik sehingga key yang sama digunakan untuk proses enkripsi dan dekripsi rc 5 dapat diimplentasikan dengan hard ware ataupun soft ware dimana rc 5 menggunakan dasar operasi komputasi yang biasa digunakan pada konsep dasar mikroprosesor rc 5 mempunyai kemampuan proses enkripsi dan dekripsi yang cepat besar nya kemampuan ini diperlihatkan dengan cara kerja beroreantasi pada kata rc 5 dapat disesuaikan untuk bermacam macam prosesor yang memiliki panjang bit data yang berbeda contohnya untuk prosesor 64 bit dapat dipakai untuk rc 5 dengan panjang kata yang diolah lebih panjang atau disesuaikan dengan kemampuan prosesor tersebut rc 5 memiliki struktur yang iterative dengan variabel jumlah rotasi putaran sehingga pengguna secara eksplisit dapat memanipulasi trade off antara kecepatan dan tingkat keamanan rc 5 mempunyai variabel panjang key word yang dapat divariasikan sehingga pengguna dapat memilih tingkat keamanan yang dikehendaki sesuai dengan aplikasi yang digunakan rc 5 sangat sedehana sehingga mudah untuk diimplementasikan pengembangan rc 5 didasari kepada keinginan untuk mendapatkan tingkat keamanan yang tinggi agar sulit dipecahkan ada beberapa pengembangan yang sudah dilakukan diantaranya 7 konsep pengembangan ini memasukan jumlah putaran r i k yang didapat dari kunci rahasia k konsep putaran yang digunakan tergantung kepada jumlah key yang digunakan jadi semakin banyak jumlah key konsep pengembangan ini memasukan jumlah putaran f r pengembangan yang terbaru dari rc 5 disebut dengan rc 6 konsep dasar pengembangan ini menggunakan putaran fungsi kuadratik berikut ini terhadap 5 bit bagian atas pada kondisi nyata semua algoritma enkripsi data yang ada masih dapat dipecahkan kuncinya oleh para kritoanalis hal ini menunjukan bahwa tidak ada algoritma enkripsi data yang sempurna termasuk juga disini algoritma rc 5 untuk enkripsi model rc 5 masih terdapat beberapa kelebiha dan kelemahan yaitu diantaranya kesulitan mengetahui sebuah nilai dalam table pengembangan key karena prose pengembangan key dilakukan secara random algoritma enkripsi ini dapat diimplementasikan dalam bentuk hard ware karena pada dasarnya algoritm in menggunakan operasi yang dapat dilakukan oleh perangkat keras seperti prosesor hal ini telah dibuktikan oleh e chitalwala 1 t el ghazawi 1 n alexandridis 1 1 the george washington university washington dc 2 george mason university fairfax tingkat keamanan dari enkripsi yang dilakukan dapat dipilih dengan menggunakan jumlah kata kunci yang digunakan hal ini terlihat bahwa jumlah kata kunci akan menentukan jumlah pembagian algoritma rc 5 dapat diserang dengan menggunakan analisa dari bagian table pengembangan kunci rahasia salah satu kelemahan umum dari metode enkripsi simetrik adalah masalah manajemen kunci hal ini juga terdapat pada rc 5 dimana penerima harus memiliki kunci yang sama untuk membuka chipertext yang dikirimkan kepadanya hal ini juga merupakan suatu kelemahan yang dapat dimanfaatkan oleh penyerang bruce schneier applied

2144038 menjelang wafatnya abu musa berpesan wahai anakku ingatlah tentang kisah si pemilik roti dikisahkan ada seorang laki laki yang beribadah dalam padepokannya selama 70 tahun tidak pernah turun beranjak kecuali satu hari saja ketika itu ada setan yang datang menyerupai seorang perempuan kemudian ahli ibadah ini hidup bersama perempuan tersebut selama 7 hari 7 malam setelah itu terbukalah tabirnya dia pun keluar dan ber taubat setiap kali dia melangkahkan kaki untuk melakukan sesuatu ia selalu shalat dan bersujud suatu malam ia berlindung ke sebuah toko di sana terdapat 12 orang miskin karena merasa sangat lelah akhirnya ber istirahat di sela sela antara dua orang lelaki miskin tiba tiba seorang rahib datang dia diutus mendatangi orang orang miskin ini setiap malam dengan membawa roti yang banyak lalu memberikannya ke setiap orang di antara mereka itu satu roti besar rahib itu melewati laki laki yang bertaubat tersebut mengira bahwasanya dia juga orang miskin akhirnya dia pun memberinya satu roti besar pula ada satu orang miskin yang belum kebagian roti lalu bertanya kepada rahib mengapa anda tidak memberi aku roti rahib yang membagikan roti itu menjawab sungguh malam ini aku tidak memberimu sesuatu apa pun laki laki yang bertaubat itu memperhatikan roti yang dipe gangnya lalu memberikannya kepada si miskin yang tidak kebagian dan sangat membutuhkan karena lapar dan lelah keesokan harinya laki laki bertaubat itu meninggal kemudian ibadahnya selama 70 tahun ditimbang dengan kemaksiatannya selama 7 malam ternyata lebih berat keburukan nya yang 7 malam dan kebaikannya memberi sepotong roti ditimbang dengan kemaksiatannya selama 7 malam dan lebih berat kebaikannya memberi roti abu musa berkata wahai anakku ingat ingatlah kisah si pemberi roti itu

2144132 guide for writing the historiographic essay the historiographic essay is an important and critical literary form in its own right providing the reader with a sense of how the topic s he is interested in has already been approached and treated by previous historians an awareness of the historiography on your topic is an essential prerequisite to undertaking research and writing using both secondary and primary sources knowing the kinds of approaches and interpretations already employed by others as well as the still unanswered questions on the topic can help direct your research and writing the writing of a historiographic essay is also an excellent learning exercise since in order to write one it is necessary to become immersed in the intellectual processes of historians as they modify and revise ourview of the past your historiographic essay will focus on the topic you have chosen for your research from the books and articles you have already chosen for your annotated bibliography you should identify the major interpretive works research their authors and their historiographical schools of thought and write a 4 to 5 page historiographic essay your essay will include endnotes or footnotes and a bibliography for those sources you will consult and cite in the writing of the essay you will also consult scholarly reviews of the works your cite to see that you are on the right track for example if you do a term paper on the popular response to the reformation you would write a historiographic essay based on the major proponents of the various interpretative schools you would most likely consult the works of steven ozment a g dickens and peter blickle who hold that there was a significant amount of support among the people and robert scribner gerald strauss and euan cameron who believe most people were neutral or hostile to reformation at first after reading pertinent passages in works by these authors and consulting scholarly reviews of them you can discuss dispassionately their interpretations and your assessment of the state of current historiography on the topic

2144144 rich countries need to demonstrate leadership by making deep early cuts they need to put in place a framework for finance and technology transfer providing developing countries with the resources they need to make a low carbon transition
2144145 the window of opportunity for avoiding dangerous climate change is closing fast it is a serious issue that must be tackled with a sense of urgency because it is a global problem with global causes and effects it demands a global response with countries acting on the basis of their historic responsibility and capabilities
2144146 world leaders need to get real about the consequences of climate change we urgently need stringent mitigation if you delay action the human cost will be enormous
2144147 the wealthiest countries should make the biggest efforts to cut ghgs gases as rapidly as possible
2144148 the stability of human society could be destructed if we allow these impacts of climate change to continue unabated and emissions of ghgs remain unmitigated
2144149 quite a few states have austin real estate taxes that are calculated in arrears that is they have already been paid or mostly paid by the seller by the time you buy
2144150 in the first year youre seeing taxes that are someone elses responsibility so youre not getting the full tax value of your mortgage calculator interest also could be a myth if youve lived in your home for a long time
2144151 every deductible expense you incur may not produce a deduction
2144152 some buyers think hope they can write off everything connected with the house
2144153 not so association fees and property insurance costs are not deductible
2144154 ive had people say i put a new roof on my home can i deduct that no
2144155 if you convert the home to rental property or sell it
2144156 i recently heard some neighbors talking about having to buy another house when they sell to avoid the taxes
2144157 if the last time you sold the house was before 1997 youre thinking of those old rules
2144158 before it didnt really matter much whether you sold frequently or held onto your home for a long term you basically could roll over the gain into a larger home and people could avoid tax until they sold for the final time without putting it into a replacement home
2144159 now the law rewards people who sell frequently in this current market people who sell every couple of years can get and keep their gain
2144160 but people who buy and hold might find they have reached the point where the gain exceeds the exclusion
2144161 they thought since were never going to be taxed on the sale theres no need to keep track of what we paid and what improvements we made
2144162 now with inflation in the housing market a lot of people are selling homes in excess of the gains without any way to show that their tax bill should be less
2144163 sometimes well hear about taxpayers who in doing some quick back of the envelope estate planning decide to put their home in the childrens names
2144164 the thinking is my son or daughter wont have to worry about this when i die
2144165 when you sell your home for a loss its not like other capital items
2144166 you dont get to deduct personal property that you sell for a loss
2144167 its the same as any personal property that declines in value
2144168 like that old tv you sold to the neighbor kid so he could take it to college you sold it for much less than you paid but you cant take a loss

2144180 oh you who believe devour not usury doubled and multiplied but fear allah that you may prosper
2144181 that they took usury though they were forbidden and they devoured peoples wealth wrongfully we have prepared for those amongst them who reject faith a grievous chastisement
2144182 that which you give in usury for increase through the property of people will have no increase with allah but that which you give for charity seeking the countenance of allah it is these who will get a recompense

2144190 the righteous man will flourish like the palm tree he will grow like a cedar in lebanon planted in the house of the lord they will flourish in the courts of our god they will still yield in old age they shall be full of sap and very green to declare that the lord is upright he is my rock and there is no unrighteousness in him
2144191 satisfies your years with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle
2144192 a joyful heart is good medicine but a broken spirit dries up the bones

2144194 god doesnt want us keeping and continuing with old hurts old criticism and old jealousy
2144195 god leads us one step at a time if you wait until you can figure it out youll live most of your life in disobedience
2144196 most people are so shortsighted they look at what do i feel what do i want people with vision look beyond today we live in a world of shortsightedness its not what happens today its what can happen what will happen
2144197 some stories dont have a clear beginning middle and end

2144199 pitiful is the person who is afraid of taking risks perhaps this person will never be disappointed or disillusioned perhaps she wont suffer the way people do when they have a dream to follow but when the person looks back she will hear her heart
2144200 for i know the plans i have for you declares the lord plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you a hope and a future

2144406 ya dia tidak masuk setiap kali seperti itu dia menunggu di luar sampai musa selesai bahkan terkadang sampai musa hendak meninggalkan perkemahan dia masih berdiam di sana
2144407 apakah ia selalu berbicara diikuti bunyi gemuruh dan guntur seperti yang pernah kulihat di gunung sinai ketika tuanku lalu naik ke atas gunung itu ataukah ia berbicara dengan lembut seperti angin sepoi
2144408 tuanku jatuh cinta begitu rupa padanya tuanku begitu terpesona ah seperti apa rasanya berbincang dengannya
2144409 tak apa kalau aku tidak diperbolehkan masuk setidaknya biarkan aku diam di sini sedikit lebih dekat dengannya meskipun mungkin ia tidak memandang diriku sebagaimana ia memandang tuanku musa tapi tak apa merasakan hadiratnya saja aku sangat bersukacita
2144410 lebih lama lagi tuhan lebih lagi jangan pergi dulu tuhan
2144411 tuhan sudah selesai berbicara padaku mari kita pulang ke perkemahan untuk menyampaikan firman tuhan
2144412 mungkinkah aku dapat bertemu dengan pribadi itu mungkinkah ia mau berbicara denganku
2144413 kuatkan dan teguhkanlah hatimu sebab engkau akan masuk bersama sama dengan bangsa ini ke negeri yang dijanjikan tuhan dengan sumpah kepada nenek moyang mereka untuk memberikannya kepada mereka dan engkau akan memimpin mereka sampai mereka memilikinya
2144414 aku memimpin umat yang besar ini bagaimana mungkin aku tidak mungkin bisa memimpin seperti tuanku musa bagaimana caranya memimpin umat yang tegar tengkuk ini aku masih ingat ketika mereka hendak melempari aku dan kaleb dengan batu ketika kami kembali dari pengintaian
2144415 bukankah telah kuperintahkan kepadamu kuatkan dan teguhkanlah hatimu janganlah kecut dan tawar hati sebab tuhan allahmu menyertai engkau ke manapun engkau pergi seorangpun tidak akan dapat bertahan menghadapi engkau seumur hidupmu seperti aku menyertai musa demikianlah aku akan menyertai engkau aku tidak akan membiarkan engkau dan tidak akan meninggalkan engkau

2144435 im to get them ready she wants you to help wrangle the big one with mr bones as backup
2144436 gives you a bit more than an hour twenty minutes for each think thats enough
2144437 it usually is theyre all recovered the big one epstein he was sick probably due to alcohol mixing with the drugs
2144438 okay now im here to explain everything take some good deep breaths youre in a new world my friend a new life and we think that ultimately you will be much much happier in this life than you were in your old one
2144439 okay you are james frederick brosman age 31 formerly of 4765 pensacola boulevard tampa bay we have done our research jim we know quite a lot about you
2144440 wait a minute what the fuck is this who are you people
2144441 all in good time jim youve got a lot to learn and not much time you need to concentrate and get it down fast believe me when i tell you how important this is
2144442 you will never know believe this you will never find out where this is it is not even worth trying its just one of a long list of things you have to stop thinking about
2144443 oh but you will you see you are also spankybunnsy on mistress ts female dominance lifestyle website and forums
2144444 i know because i help run the site you have been an active member for two years you have been a paying member for eighteen months your fetish wishlist includes intimate otk spankings facesitting ass worship foot worship whipping tease and denial and personal service to a domme
2144445 if it helps you at all i can tell you that i share most of those interests okay
2144446 so i know that you were hoping to become mistress avas personal live in slave and houseboy
2144447 so it was arranged for you to meet mistress ava via the chat room you exchanged 436 messages with mistress ava including nude photos of yourself you informed misstress ava that you were ready and willing to meet her and if you passed inspection to become her slave
2144448 so you went to the lido hotel in memphis to meet mistress ava in person you then accompanied her to bar mystique on river street you remember
2144449 we went to that weird little bar mistress ava wanted to go there oh god shes so beautiful
2144450 yes she is so are miss carol and miss ruth who also supply us with men like yourself
2144451 if we do decide on a capture then we usually use a dose of bute in a drink its cheap easy and relatively safe once youve been dosed the slavetaker gets the prospect out of public view and into a private space and uses her uh charms to uh beguile the male until the bute takes effect
2144452 right anyway once youre dosed then the slavetaker calls in her own personal slave to help get the prospect out of the building and into the van the prospect rides on a nice foam mattress in soft bondage gagged blindfolded with high quality ear plugs the van is driven directly here no stops on the way and the prospect is unloaded here and left to wake up as you did this morning
2144453 look jim listen up accept that everything im telling you is absolutely true okay it will make understanding your situation a lot easier
2144454 we have studied your life james we know that you have had two significant relationships with women and that both ended when you tried to get them to dominate you you confessed all that to mistress ava we then checked out the stories discreetly and found them to be largely true we placed spyware on your computer and checked your files we watched you spend your evening surfing femdom websites and collecting femdom porn we know what you dream of we intend to make your dreams come true
2144455 thats the kernel of the case you are no longer james frederick bosman you no longer live anywhere your assets such as they are will eventually be signed over to us oh i know that sounds harsh but we have a lot of work to do before we can sell you to your eventual lifetime owner
2144456 thats what our business here is james we find males like you we kidnap them we train them to be wonderful slaves for women and we sell them
2144457 i am old slave i have been mistresss property for nearly ten years now
2144458 ohmigod wow incredible i mean is she like queen patricia at the owk
2144459 actually jim our operation here is much more serious than the owk we have a great deal of respect for queen patricia and the ladies of the owk but here we take men and make them into slaves and then we sell them for profit understand
2144460 i do it seems fantastic but its real now jim you will be meeting mistress very soon my job is to prepare you for that interview so that it runs smoothly if it doesnt then it will become painful for you very painful mistress believes in the whip the paddle the strap and the strap on let me assure you that mistress has broken more men than she can count mistress will break you too james if you resist her
2144461 they dont apply here not the ones youre talking about
2144462 oh i dont know about that no one has ever found out about it yet
2144463 we have a very friendly doctor on call she and her partner have two slaves from here who serve them 24 7 we have an excellent small medical facility right here its disguised as a veterinarian station but we can do everything up to heart surgery if necessary
2144464 you mean has anyone died here no we pick healthy men for raw material we research them carefully and though we can be brutal we are careful too
2144465 good you are accepting the situation this is the only way to move forward
2144466 no you do you wanted to be a womans personal slave you wanted to be kept in chastity and used for facesitting and personal services you made all that very clear that has been your dream all your life now your dream will become real in a few months you will be trained to provide perfect total 24 7 service as a womans domestic slave servant maid companion whatever you will be capable of serving such a woman in any way she sees fit you will be a good cook a house cleaner a housemaid a sex object a bed slave and a toilet slave
2144467 if your future mistress owner requires you to suck cock you will suck cock very well if she requires you to drink her urine you will drink her urine if she wants an hour every day of ass worship then you will provide it you get the picture im sure
2144468 well actually you did you remember that thread in mistress ts forum about kidnapping
2144469 yes you said it was an exciting idea you wished it happened in reality
2144470 im going to wake up soon i know it this is the most amazing dream
2144471 no jim slave mistress is gonna come through that door in less than forty minutes you had better be prepared to submit to her completely you got me anything less than absolute total submission to her will and your ass is gonna end up being really sore take it from me theres no way out of this except one to accept who you are what you are and what youre gonna be
2144472 so goodbye for now slave jim prepare yourself when you see mistress come through this door get on your knees before her as fast as you can obey her every command listen and learn from her accept your new life and remember that this is what you always wanted
2144473 the worst that can happen is you get it wrong

2144609 the corrosion resistance of stainless steel materials depends on the formation of a thin and dense passivating oxide layer breakage of this passivating layer is possible in the presence of halogen ions such as chlorine iodine and bromine due to the attack of these ions an increased corrosion takes place at locations where the passivating layer is interrupted the corrosion attack takes place in the form of small pits which can propagate and destroy even thick parts in a rather short time therefore pitting corrosion has to be regarded as a much more severe attack and corrosion form than homogeneous corrosion the corrosion rate increases with decreasing ph value acid value of the solution and increasing oxidising ability of the electrolyte surface areas which show signs of mechanical treatment or cold formed areas accelerate the corrosion attack alloying with molybdenum and increasing chromium content reduces the susceptibility to pitting corrosion for chromium and chromium nickel steels pitting corrosion is not restricted to stainless steel it may also take place on other materials creating a passive layer e g aluminium

2144650 que si mis padres me han hablado de sexo lo han intentado pero les cuesta se ponen raros me hablan de la semillita y del pito como si fuera un ni o de cinco a os conozco los gestos faciales de mi madre y cuando dice vagina le cambia la cara las pocas veces que han sacado el tema ha sido para lo t pico de que tome precauciones que no vaya a echar mi vida a perder por un calent n no tengo muy claro que sean las personas id neas para hablarme de sexo en condiciones son cincuentones y en este tema siguen en su poca no me lo imagino me dar a la risa en realidad no s si quiero prefiero hacerlo con mi hermano mayor
2144651 ha sido una conversaci n que me he impuesto porque cre a que era necesaria cuando lo hablo trato de no darle importancia pero cuando acabo pienso uf por fin es como si te hubieras quitado un peso de encima
2144652 de sexo buf he tenido la suerte de que mis padres nunca me han hablado de eso
2144653 para muchos padres hablar de sexo con sus hijos implica darles permiso para tener actividad sexual sin embargo hablar no significa autorizar la informaci n combinada con el respeto y la tolerancia permitir que no se enfrenten a pr cticas de riesgo por absurdo que parezca sta es la nica v a realmente efectiva diversos estudios han comprobado que cuando los padres son excesivamente r gidos o temen hablar del tema empujan a los hijos a averiguar por sus propios medios lo que desconocen igualmente los padres muy liberales que impiden en los hijos un desarrollo tranquilo de la sexualidad los impulsan a probar experiencias sexuales sin que est n preparados para ello
2144654 los padres son la mejor voz para transmitir educaci n sexual
2144655 pero es un error esperar a que sea adolescente hay que empezar desde que es peque o llamando pene al pene y vulva a la vulva y no de mil maneras est pidas hay que ayudarle a que entienda su cuerpo que hay rganos que aunque ahora no lo siente de mayor le dar n placer que todo eso tiene que ver con la procreaci n eso ayudar a que cuando sea adolescente se pueda seguir hablando porque hoy en d a los chicos est n sobreinformados pero no formados muchos padres piensan yo qu voy a hablar con ste si sabe m s que yo y no es cierto se ha demostrado que por m s que los adolescentes quieran cortar el cord n lo que dicen los padres lo toman muy en serio y les hacen m s caso del que parece pero muchos padres han dejado todo este asunto en manos de los colegios que suelen llegar tarde las primeras clases de educaci n sexual las reciben a los 14 o 15 a os una edad a la que algunos tienen ya experiencia
2144656 por lo que veo los padres est n desbordados lo primero que me dicen es que les da verg enza hablar del tema es normal en este pa s ha habido generaciones y generaciones que han crecido con el ap ate t mismo trato mucho con adolescentes y enseguida me doy cuenta de cu ndo a uno le han hablado del tema en casa porque lo aborda con mucha m s tranquilidad
2144657 cuando a tu hijo lo abrazas lo mimas ya le est s dando autoestima y todo eso ya es placer sexual m s adelante cuando empiece a preguntar de d nde vienen los ni os hay que responder de forma sincera aunque no se haga de forma perfecta no se trata de que seamos todos sex logos lo importante es que tu hijo sepa que te puede preguntar lo que sea para que as acabes siendo su fuente de informaci n pero si tratamos de empezar a hacerlo cuando ya ha cumplido 14 a os llegamos tarde los referentes de los ni os son primero la familia y despu s los maestros los de los adolescentes son sus iguales y despu s los medios de comunicaci n hay que trabaj rselo antes
2144658 una poca maravillosa y perfecta para la educaci n sexual es de los 7 a los 11 a os a esa edad comprenden todo y pueden visualizar las cosas aun sin emociones y cuando los padres todav a son una autoridad moral para ellos m s tarde olv date qu vas a contarle a un adolescente de 14 a os y enamorado
2144659 hay que mantener la comunicaci n usando lo que yo llamo el mon logo
2144660 aunque parezca que no te escuchan que est n con los cascos del mp3 puestos y en otro planeta te est n escuchando yo me he sorprendido dici ndoles cosas que me dec an mis padres y que me espantaban y mira a os m s tarde me han encajado
2144661 no sirve de nada ponerse muy serio a largar un discurso hay que darles cancha aceptar con picard a el que mam y yo tenemos sexo hasta contar chistes verdes los padres tienden a ocultar su propia sexualidad y as tampoco la mostrar su hijo se pueden decir cosas como mam y yo nos vamos arriba a dormir la siestecita y con un poquito de picaresca ir mostr ndoles que nosotros tambi n somos seres sexuados
2144662 en mi opini n no se trata tanto de un asunto de contenido como de hacerse part cipes de vivencias los padres pueden empezar contando vivencias de su pasado c mo ten as ganas de tal cosa de c mo te temblaban las rodillas antes de una cita eso puede aportar un poquito m s de naturalidad y ayudar a estar m s cercanos y a acortar el abismo generacional
2144663 mi hija me cuenta esas cosas que yo no le contaba ni muerta a mi madre pero estoy segura de que es porque yo siempre le he contado mis cosas
2144664 considero que esto es un quid pro cuo no vale con s lo preguntar estoy divorciada desde hace tiempo y si tengo un disgusto con mi actual novio se lo cuento nunca la rega o la escucho parto de la base de que lo sepa yo o no lo sepa si quiere hacer algo lo va a hacer as que es mejor saberlo el nico consejo que le doy sobre sexo es siempre el mismo cuando decidas hacer algo dec delo t entonces te sentir s a gusto tengas 14 o 25 a os
2144665 soy la rara de mi clase porque hablo de casi todo con mi madre
2144666 creo que es bueno veo que cuando mis amigas tienen una relaci n con un chico se dejan llevar sin pensar mucho yo s cu ndo parar qu quiero y qu no quiero
2144667 esas cosas las hablar con mis amigas que es mi madre
2144668 no soy partidaria de que los padres den informaci n basada en experiencias personales por mi consulta ha pasado gente que me ha dicho lo m s horrible de mi vida fue cuando mi padre me cont c mo se lo montaba en la cama hay que poner un l mite al igual que no le vas a contar a tu hijo que de peque o robabas en los grandes almacenes yo separo lo que es hablar de sexo pr ctico y el te rico cuando hay padres que me dicen que quieren ser amigos de sus hijos les digo que me parece muy mal porque lo que une a los amigos es la complicidad y un padre y un hijo no deben ser c mplices yo siempre he dicho que para estas cosas la figura ideal es la del t o tiene la autoridad del padre pero no las prerrogativas
2144669 la t pica conversaci n sobre la regla las relaciones sexuales en mi casa eran una entelequia
2144670 no es que te vayas a poner a explicarle posturas o c mo hacer una felaci n eficaz para eso est n los amigos y la propia experiencia pero creo que si desde muy ni os se aborda con naturalidad el tema la puerta siempre estar abierta y se puede ir avanzando en la comunicaci n y evitar lagunas mitos y traumas considero que en casa esa cuesti n debe estar tan presente como cualquiera otra relacionada con el crecimiento de los ni os
2144671 chelsea football club can confirm we have made an offer to real madrid today for the transfer of robinho
2144672 ive got so many friends coming to the game and theyre getting their own tickets i dont know how much ill play but when i get a chance i want to get to the end zone for the u of h fans i hope itll be a quick six
2144673 hopefully i have the mindset im at the bottom until i retire or have a chance to go in the hall of fame if thats whats written in my future
2144674 my mindset cant change at all no matter what happens i still am an undrafted guy who is trying to contribute to a team that has goals of reaching the playoffs and ultimately the super bowl
2144675 what i remember the most about playing with him in college is that we had a very talented running back in cedric benson and he really gave cedric a run for his money to start that year
2144676 so we all knew he was very talented obviously he was very good in the return game in college but him going to be a free agent and winning the starting job as the broncos running back it says a lot about him and his character hes a guy who has always worked hard we knew he had the talent to succeed at this level and to just see him doing it is a good thing
2144677 i cant tell you how much hes done for me hes been a great friend and hes been a mentor since i signed with the broncos he picked me up and took me to practice i dont think i could have anyone better to help me adjust to the nfl
2144678 hes blazing and he has the brains to learn fast and learn on the run
2144679 im sure coach is really impressed with his ability to go from one day to the next day learning from his mistakes
2144680 attorney general mukasey gave a wonderful opening prayer that really struck the president and bush noted that a number of cabinet members over the years have opened these meetings with strong words of faith
2144681 coming out of high school i felt like sfa was the place for me
2144682 i made a few immature decisions in leaving to go to central michigan but it was definitely a learning experience and i feel like everything happens for a reason
2144683 i think with the addition of duane well have the best receiving corps in the southland conference
2144684 hes definitely going to be the most improved receiver on the field with our starting guys and hes got the ability to do whatever he wants to do hes a great athlete he knows the game he reads coverages and hes a smart football player
2144685 with him on the field you dont have to see anything for him because hes seeing the same thing im seeing and were on the same page it makes it a lot smoother on the field
2144686 his work ethic on the field and his way of helping the chemistry on our team has been tremendous hes definitely an asset on and off the field and hes a great guy and great worker as the season goes i think well really be proud that we have him at sfa
2144687 they will mean a lot on one hand for the rest of the world to discover what china really is to discover a country that for most people of the world is a bit mysterious
2144688 they will see a country with a history and a tradition and a culture of 5 000 years they will see a fascinating country and i think this will change the perception of china throughout the world
2144689 you have to look at the goal of the chinese government which is not to gain international acceptance but to impress their domestic audience
2144690 and since they control 100 percent of the media i think they will achieve what they are looking to gain which is a series of images showing that they have brought the world to china
2144691 there is something about the undercurrent of excitement and anticipation here in beijing and certainly from what we read and hear from our friends back in the united states it feels as if were sitting on top of something special
2144692 what the olympics promote is a form of amoral universalism in which all countries are entitled to take part in the games no matter how barbaric their leaders may be
2144693 im not sure there has ever been an olympic games that will have had as big an impact as these games will have on china
2144694 they provide such a stage to present the host country to the world
2144695 nobody questions chinas future in the world politically socially economically but for the everyday man in the street theres not a lot known about china and these games will be a unique opportunity to present not only the sporting platform but cultural educational and social aspects
2144696 the genius of the olympics is that in theory it allows the chinese government to build its image domestically by means of improving chinas image internationally
2144697 we have to wake up new york to the reality that we all have to feel some pain
2144698 mls is on the side right now its great to get a goal not only personally but to get a win
2144699 now we have to go against holland then nigeria i couldnt be happier the guys couldnt be happier peter nowak the coach couldnt be happier
2144700 we created a lot of chances and we were dangerous in the final third
2144701 were very pleased with the schedule we were able to put together during our off season
2144702 we feel the schedule that weve set allows us to improve and compete against some of the upper tier programs in the country
2144703 we became alarmed a couple of days ago when we saw he wasnt sweating like he should
2144704 when these kids try to make weight sometimes they cut corners what we believe is he did not increase his fluid intake after we told him to
2144705 we thought he was a very good shot at a medal
2144706 we try to tell the team when we have these types of adversities we still have eight guys in there and were going to try to concentrate on what weve got
2144707 ive just always thought winning a gold medal would mean more than being a world champion or winning all that money or anything
2144708 im glad hes on my squad and others will have to stop him
2144709 bars is better than nothing bars is better than going home
2144710 im glad they still wanted me to be part of the team and still needed my bars routine im ecstatic that i can still contribute to the team
2144711 had she been here just for floor we would have been home already but bars is the key to everything
2144712 i did have a little breakdown im not going to lie that i started crying
2144713 but thats expected when you injure something at the olympic games it isnt the greatest thing that you can do but we came up with a plan that i would be able to do bars and still be able to contribute they still wanted my routine and im grateful for that
2144714 that was another part of the little breakdown that i had
2144715 but you know i got over it and when i got to practice the afternoon of the injury it was like ok this is the new plan
2144716 she had to rally quickly were at the olympic games theres no time for crying
2144717 you have to get in and do your job its not like shes by herself she has five other girls depending on what shes doing
2144718 this is the way she grew up life is not fair you have to make the best of this situation
2144719 delegates are not formally pledged to any candidate so clinton does not need to
2144720 you can type any combination you like and you dont have to know the airport abbreviation to launch your search
2144721 but they dont know what theyre talking about this is what its really like
2144722 did you think of me today are you proud of who i am its your freedom that im fighting for in this foreign land
2144723 it could be a fun change of pace rockin the country scene
2144724 they have been instrumental in their efforts to make this promotion a success
2144725 one of the flag men at the speedway gave it to me
2144726 at times the service men and women are entertained while on duty but this event gives them the opportunity to enjoy and share our show with their family and friends
2144727 its also a chance for the community to show their appreciation and support
2144728 i think we have to step back regardless of our politics or whether or not we believe in the war and really understand what kind of sacrifice these folks are making for us every single day
2144729 i think the honor is by saying we know youre there we know the sacrifice youre making and we appreciate it
2144730 we wanted the focus of the actual ceremony to be on what we promised one another and not on the pageantry of a public wedding
2144731 when looking for a b2b solution the choice was very easy centerstone has a tremendous track record in providing a fast and easy solution which is a perfect fit for us
2144732 we want to be the easiest company for specialty retailers to purchase pure outdoor merino from centerstones ivendix solution has a proven track record is widely accepted and will allow our dealers and sales reps to order 24 7 that means more merino for everyone
2144733 icebreaker has joined a growing list of companies that understand the urgency of becoming more efficient given the speed at which business is changing and against the backdrop of a slowing economy to succeed let alone just survive the old ways of conducting business at the wholesale level have to be replaced with more efficient processes
2144734 icebreaker like all our clients came to the realization that their b2b site targeted at specialty retailers and sales reps is as important as their b2c web site which is targeted at consumers
2144735 essentially ivendix becomes the foundation for icebreakers b2b internet strategy for their retailer community after all specialty retailers the wholesale buyers in reality spend more dollars directly with a manufacturer than individual consumers so providing a b2b solution for them is imperative we are excited that icebreaker has recognized the potential of ivendix as their b2b e commerce solution and with more than 12 000 active users of our web based application we are confident that dealers will also be quick to embrace ivendix for icebreaker

2144755 mls is on the side right now its great to get a goal not only personally but to get a win
2144756 now we have to go against holland then nigeria i couldnt be happier the guys couldnt be happier peter nowak the coach couldnt be happier
2144757 we created a lot of chances and we were dangerous in the final third
2144758 i feel that were the guys that every time we go there that everybody has to pay attention to us in order to win stewart said
2144759 now there are times we dont win obviously but were still in the hunt every time and got a shot
2144760 its not like were not running well because we are said stewart who has won four of the past six races at the glen and will be inducted friday into the tracks legends of the glen
2144761 weve just had some circumstances that havent gone our way youll have that
2144762 in nine years weve won four races if you cant be counted as a factor after that i dont know when they do count you as a factor
2144763 when you have a day like we had last year at the glen and the laps that we were ahead of jeff we could drive away from him a little bit it makes you feel good said stewart who led 20 laps a year ago
2144764 i know what it should feel like to go fast said gordon who has finishes of 10th fifth and 11th since infineon
2144765 were working way way too hard for these types of finishes
2144766 his salaam knee has been bothering him since he woke up this morning
2144767 its really bothering him and its a big concern weve got to figure out whats bothering him
2144768 the bottom line with fred and scott is when we lost them we thought we were looking at a short period of time
2144769 we thought theyd be back but here we are two weeks into it and theyre still over there riding bikes
2144770 thats not good for the team and its not good for their situation trying to make this team but theres nothing you can do were trying to get them healthy but were really down some bodies on the offensive line right now
2144771 i had the chance to see it june 21 in chicago and you cant beat it if you love country music
2144772 i got the chance to meet a lot of them
2144773 i thought this concert would be a great time to get some tickets to the local firefighters and the people that serve the community i think they deserve a little payback
2144774 a guy like him getting hurt its part of football unfortunately and theres not a play that you dont hold your breath in all honesty
2144775 youve just got to keep pushing through and hope for the best and hopefully its our time to stay healthy weve been pretty fortunate through this camp weve been pretty darn good keep our fingers crossed with him and see what happens
2144776 normally when you have a pull or something you can tell when youre running by the way it feels
2144777 i didnt feel anything pop or anything like that i just felt it tighten up real tight on me when i felt that i just slowed down i didnt feel a pop or anything like that afterward so like i said im fine ill get treatment for a few days and ill be fine
2144778 to be honest with you hes not in the shape the rest of our football team is and we found that out real fast
2144779 he got gassed the first night he was out here he got gassed earlier today and hes not up with our team unfortunately thats what happens when you bring guys in the middle of camp if theyre not in excellent shape they get exposed in a way very very quick i just dont think he was in very good condition
2144780 what we have to do is weve got to prepare that if we suit seven who are those seven
2144781 so were getting right guard brisiel some work at center because that could always be an option of course eslinger to me is really an improved player so well see how it pans out
2144782 for the players when you walk in camp its a long time before you actually get to walk into a stadium and play but now there is a little light at the end of the tunnel each week
2144783 we just hope we get a few of these kids back next week and get healthy and get ready to play next weekend
2144784 you dont want to be the one to tell the other that they didnt make it or if they did
2144785 i got my e mail and waited about an hour before going downstairs
2144786 he asked me if i had gotten an e mail and i was like yeah
2144787 thats a good thing because were close friends on and off the field
2144788 that helps with team chemistry and i think its unique that were the same age and have the experience with youth national teams and the olympic team in qualifying and starting today the games
2144789 its definitely nice to have a familiar face along for the ride
2144790 we dont have the pressure of being the no 1 favorite but we do have the pressure of putting u s soccer on the map and i think we are the team to do that
2144791 i dont think ill ever realize what an honor an priviledge it is
2144792 i think it will really set in when i walk out for that first game and soak it all up
2144793 the expectations stay the same the mission doesnt change at all we still feel we are medal contenders and were going to put our hearts on the floor and have a great competition
2144794 to get here and not to be able to perform because of an injury is extremely disappointing
2144795 because of my injuries im not able to do floor and vault the way i want so its best for me to step down its very tough because its the end of my career and not in the way i planned it
2144796 can go out and compete with anyone and i believe theyre going to show the heart of america here in beijing
2144797 its an honor to be on this team but its a shame that it had to happen this way with morgan getting hurt
2144798 this is a different crew i think raj will surprise people and ive got a feeling sasha will have a strong meet if he can quit worrying about things and quit trying to be perfect and just compete theres no stopping him
2144799 morgan hamm is one of my best friends and my heart goes out to him
2144800 but theres still a job to do the usa has a deep team we can bring in another athlete and still give it our all
2144801 it was go no go time it was extremely difficult to require him to show readiness when i knew he was in an incredible amount of pain but saturday is right around the corner
2144802 it will be good to have him console me and maybe me console him a little bit
2144803 i lose six points in a row that never happens
2144804 i got a little bit nervous and he played well on those points
2144805 i benefit from being able to focus in a tunnel vision way on what will happen in the venues im certainly not unaware of all the surrounding subplots but i do not worry about the joy and success of the athletes that we will see starting saturday morning and i dont worry about the exhilaration that will be present in almost every venue
2144806 you will have an one of the iconic sports figures in this country yao ming playing against a u s team filled with instantly recognizable stars and the two heads of state
2144807 nbc is splitting its work force between beijing where about 2 400 workers are on hand and new york where about 600 will handle the internet operation and other duties
2144808 one of the first things we did online was the world skiing championships in 2007
2144809 it was all live and all without commentary i watched it on my desktop and between the graphics that the world feed uses and the pa in the venue i knew whats going on
2144810 its a lofty goal and were going to try to achieve it neal said facetiously
2144811 theres nothing better than a live olympics to have more than half of our prime time shows live with premium events i couldnt ask for anything more
2144812 we always want to aim higher i go back to what we discussed about the atmosphere in beijing there is a genuine sense of something special i just hope it plays out
2144813 a lot of times when you get to an event like this the olympic games you can put too much pressure yourself so ive kind of got an out in cancer in that it kind of keeps things in perspective for me
2144814 the why me thing is one of the first things that goes through your mind
2144815 they give you the original diagnosis and the first thing you think is no way this isnt happening to me how is this happening to me im supposed to be one of these elite athletes im going into trials with an invincible mindset and all of a sudden ive got cancer
2144816 you think all of that initially after that you have to take ownership of it ive got it i accept that and im gonna beat it theres no question in my mind
2144817 hes the guy that i looked to before i even came down with this disease and was diagnosed
2144818 when you look at what he did after he was diagnosed and then treated for it you cant help but be inspired by that
2144819 ive talked to him lance has made a couple of comments about my situation hes behind me 100 percent when youve got someone like that him supporting you its a pretty cool thing it gives you a lot of confidence
2144820 when he walked out of the room both aaron and i looked at each other and it was like wow
2144821 it gives you a better sense of the bigger picture the olympics looks a lot smaller when youre dealing with something like cancer thats the biggest impact on us what were doing here is not on as high a pedestal as we usually put it
2144822 the first couple of days after hearing the news you really feel bad for him then its almost like you forget that he has it because he doesnt act like he has something wrong with him i look at him and i cannot believe what hes going through and still has that drive to want to be here and be with the team and do his best its an amazing thing to watch
2144823 what i show the general public is obviously the positive side
2144824 but i am human and this has been a roller coaster ride this isnt just the flu its cancer it is on my mind constantly i cant help that its just how its going to be but with the support staff that i have and the people in my corner they make things a lot easier on me
2144825 the biggest bridge i had to cross was deciding to come here
2144826 it wasnt necessarily a decision that i had any control over
2144827 its a dream come true making the olympic team especially with how close i was in 2004 just missing it its something ive been trying to do my entire life im just happy that i finally made it
2144828 one of the doctors ive been working with is one of the guys responsible for inverting the cure rate
2144829 back in the 80s when the treatments were first coming out this was a five percent survival rate now its 95 99 percent curable when you hear statistics like that im gonna be cured
2144830 im not worried about this affecting me the rest of my life
2144831 hes a proven player who has been a starter in this league
2144832 at this point and time we had to move on
2144833 when you go through a season the toughest position to fill is the point guard position
2144834 two cents in savings more than 10 years from now
2144835 two oilmen in the white house equals 4 a gallon gas
2144836 we need her to save the american family and the american taxpayer and to save the american middle class
2144837 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
2144838 we thought lets try and start a movement where even while walking down the street people would hold up the o and you would know that they were for obama
2144839 you interlace your hands in a circle the interlacing being a symbol of different types of people coming together and the circle a symbol of unity
2144840 the conditions were much tougher than i expected this morning so i was happy that i was still able to go out and put together a decent score
2144841 the putter was the key to the round i putted pretty well yesterday but the greens were spiked up so i was excited about what i would be able to do in fresher conditions today
2144842 you never know you might shoot an 8 over and it comes down to sunday and you can still have a chance to win
2144843 the course is playing a lot harder today than yesterday
2144844 the winds a lot harder i know the guys playing in the afternoon its going to be very challenging for them
2144845 we offer our sincere apologies to bocog the chinese olympic organizing committee the city of beijing and the people of china if our actions were in any way offensive
2144846 that was not our intent it was in no way meant to serve as an environmental or political statement we deeply regret the nature of our choices
2144847 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2144848 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds
2144849 if you had picked a number higher you wouldve gotten more money on your metrocard
2144850 let me warn you that when you get on and off the train during rush hours just be sure to follow your blockers
2144851 you win the super bowl and i promise you will get a key
2144852 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the new york jets and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2144853 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2144854 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things
2144855 im a little out of shape compared to the other guys
2144856 the last 24 hours have been crazy this offseason has been bizarre but im excited by this opportunity
2144857 im not going to blame one side or the other a lot of things happened this season a lot of shocking things but at this point its irrelevant
2144858 theres no ill feelings he has a positive reputation within this organization
2144859 i havent played in new york im a south mississippi boy but i know how tough the city can be and i know how great it can be
2144860 it can be as good as you want to make it
2144861 i just want to take this moment in regardless of what happens
2144862 i want to go out there and give it 100 percent and whatever happens from there failure success then i could be at peace
2144863 from that moment my mind was just focused on making a go
2144864 when i made my decision in 06 i remember saying you say you want to be in that opening ceremony you have to do something now
2144865 she almost had to remember what it was like to be put through what it takes to run fast
2144866 a real gut because i asked her if she was pregnant
2144867 due to escalating violence we have asked our parolees to immediately leave the reservation
2144868 statute allows us to relocate any offender for their safety or the safety of others
2144869 i cant believe he survived i thought my old man was going to die when i picked him up
2144870 the best thing is just to stay i dont think we would ever have given up
2144871 then i started getting pain in the back of the elbow thats when we had a bone spur things just kind of went from there
2144872 i remember vividly talking to my wife on a friday afternoon she had to fly back from my grandmothers funeral she said how was practice hows the arm
2144873 i said i was miserable this week your body tells you sometimes
2144874 when it happened it was a different feeling than ive ever had in my life
2144875 i didnt have to push it because nobody was there
2144876 it was annoying and difficult to be trying to fight a tough golf course and have the eye aggravating me at the same time
2144877 theres only one guy whos going to like this place by the end of the week
2144878 the course is 7 500 yards long the greens are firm and the pins are tucked away
2144879 they are sucking the fun out of the major championships when you set it up like that
2144880 i sound as if im moaning which i am but its a great shame
2144881 its a fantastic golf course they are great greens and they are playable but there is no need to play it as it is
2144882 one thing i try to do is to keep it even keel good or bad
2144883 hes 21 years old and he pitched like a guy whos been around 10 12 years
2144884 he had some big outs he had to get against good hitters and he didnt get spooked
2144885 sometimes it puts pressure on me sometimes you get wins with your eyes closed and sometimes there are games like this
2144886 some days we score a lot of runs some days not
2144887 i dont want my president to be average i want my president to be extraordinary
2144888 dont talk to strangers dont get in cars with strangers
2144889 the ocean of suffering is immense but if you turn around you can see the land the seed of suffering in you may be strong but dont wait until you have no more suffering before allowing yourself to be happy
2144890 the buddha called suffering a holy truth because our suffering has the capacity of showing us the path to liberation embrace your suffering and let it reveal to you the way of peace
2144891 so what do you do and where are you from and how do you like boulder
2144892 to put suffering on the same level of impermanence and non self is an error
2144893 in several sutras the buddha taught that nirvana the joy of completely extinguishing our ideas and concepts rather than suffering is one of the three dharma seals
2144894 where there is much desire to learn there of necessity will be much arguing much writing many opinions for opinion in good men is be knowledge in the making
2144895 accept me but accept me for who i am not who you think i should be
2144896 as que ya sabes busca novio siendo la n 1 y ser s feliz si sigues las reglas que de pana te obsequi hoy tambi n se puede ser feliz siendo la n 2 la n 3 depende de lo que quieras
2144897 give us free passes and popcorn and maybe a large soda that we will put 2 straws in
2144898 residents in the area were surprised by the motorcade of black suvs carrying the men in their native garb
2144899 i want to be remembered as someone who cares about others ive had a wonderful wonderful life with all the people that ive met and i dont think id trade it for anything i cant think of anything truly that i would rather do or rather spend the past 42 plus years than what ive done

2144901 when you come in at 500 600 mph drop a 500 pound bomb and then fly away you dont see what happens
2144902 you watch it all the way to impact and i mean its very vivid its right there and personal so it does stay in peoples minds for a long time
2144903 it is quite different going from potentially shooting a missile then going to your kids soccer game
2144904 you do stick around and see the aftermath of what you did and that does personalize the fight
2144905 you have a pretty good optical picture of the individuals on the ground the images can be pretty graphic pretty vivid and those are the things we try to offset we know that some folks have in some cases problems
2144906 no ones been naive enough to come in to interview but not know about that aspect of the job
2144907 in the old days traders would be in one venue at one price
2144908 for limit orders theyll now smart order quote and split the order into different venues to minimize the risk of missing liquidity due to market fragmentation
2144909 its essentially a laddering strategy if im a 23 bid and am getting hit hard should i stay at that price or drop down
2144910 looks at how the stock is trading the marketplace the short term price trends and sees if the market is coming down instead of being at 23 a trader might drop to a 20 bid wait for the market to come down take some stock and then reassess again
2144911 where someone else is making the decision for the trader
2144912 for a lot of our traders passive wasnt passive enough
2144913 they lose faith in the execution levels of algos automating the trading for them
2144914 in large liquid names where they no longer need to pay the penny spread
2144915 del registro a la escuela ejerciendo el derecho a la identidad
2144916 anyone can see this is painful from 50 feet away
2144917 i wanted people to understand the psychological ramifications of this
2144918 a support for the genitals worn by men engaging in strenuous exercise
2144919 they faker than milli vanilli lip synching faker than wwf faker than wmds
2144920 and can i wear the scream mask the mask from the movie scream
2144921 this incredible response and excitement shows that there is a huge appetite for change in colorado
2144922 i tried an early version of this interface out on my trip and it was great although my pronunciation wasnt so every now and then i would just hold up my phone to let people read what i couldnt if youre wondering about data costs i found that i could get between 200 and 400 translations in 1mb of data download although we dont charge for this service your carrier may charge for the data usage so be sure to know what your roaming rates are for my plan i found that i could translate 400 phrases for less than 10 when roaming internationally
2144923 we just got in from toronto and this is our first stop
2144924 the blueberry pies here are my daughters favourite in the whole world
2144925 the apple fritters theyve got that extra crunch to them
2144926 in the summer i come here every day for scones
2144927 we are one of those dying breeds the multi generational baker family
2144928 my husband suggested putting doughnuts on sale for one weekend for the same price they were in 1959
2144929 women over 40 in particular do not digest wheat as well as they could when they were younger and a lot of other people prefer not to eat wheat
2144930 we brought the original shelving and tried to keep everything the same during the move
2144931 we hope that when people come to dons bakery theyre comfortable
2144932 its a very soft roll that can be used for a sandwich a hamburger bun or a dinner roll and theyre nice for toast
2144933 some kids just pick them up and eat them we sell hundreds and hundreds of dozens a day
2144934 the bakery has been here since 1958 and sticky buns have been around since the beginning
2144935 its a wonderful recipe which came with the business just the right flavour and texture and very soft and light
2144936 its sort of a tea biscuit with cream cheese in the dough itself and cranberries
2144937 when it comes out of the oven we brush it with butter and dab it with sugar
2144938 i have always loved norval because of the enchanting bits of beauty visible in the distance lovely hills everywhere and the river and the pines the beautiful trees around the church
2144939 we have to keep families on the farms and its a political decision on how you spend your food dollars
2144940 herrmann loomis is not only a wonderful cook but a very good and patient teacher she is anxious and willing to share everything she knows is delighted by our triumphs and amazingly understanding when things dont go so well she has little control over is the dynamics of the random group that literally appears at her doorstep we all felt lucky that we worked well together and enjoyed each others company
2144941 generally you stay with people who have larger profiles or who have similar interests or interesting things to say it creates a couchsurfing chain
2144942 in our generation a lot of us are more open to new things and more trusting than our parents so were not suspicious of people
2144943 we trust other travellers because everyone knows how it is to be out travelling the world and needing a place to stay
2144944 to internationally network people and places create educational exchanges raise collective consciousness spread tolerance and facilitate cultural understanding
2144945 ive been in the situation where you have no money and need somewhere to stay if youre like oh man i spent 6 on lunch and im over my budget at least you know you have a couch to sleep on
2144946 i always choose hosts who have well developed profiles and extensive references and try to get to know them a bit over email
2144947 when i arrive in a city i meet them in a public place first there is always the option to politely decline the invitation and leave
2144948 ive been able to meet amazing open minded and inspiring people from around the world
2144949 people i am lucky enough to now count as friends
2144950 my concern is that the philly effort doesnt go far enough i say never put those stories online but still make sure every single reporter and editor is working hard to ensure a great online edition
2144951 for some time what i wanted was for manchester to have agreed to my transfer to madrid
2144952 ferguson listened to my arguments i listened to his and we agreed that it would be best for both parties for me to continue
2144953 this why i can affirm that i will play for manchester during the next season
2144954 before there are rumors and speculation that i will be upset i want to make one thing clear anyone who says or writes such a thing will be lying
2144955 i will be playing for manchester with all my heart and soul i will fight for and honor my jersey with the same dedication i have always shown
2144956 we postulated that the president of the united states actually took the advice of the iraq study group seriously and tried to engage diplomatically with iran
2144957 im fighting two wars and i dont need a third one
2144958 theres a real danger of any strike not only causing more instability in the region than there already is
2144959 but of actually having the opposite effect of what you want
2144960 generals are more willing to push back against things they think are stupid and gates is more willing to listen
2144961 mullen isnt just saying these things for our benefit i think it is a real effort to communicate with the civilian leadership
2144962 strengthening the nations energy security and supporting american farming communities
2144963 we are working together to make sure the fall campaign and the convention are a success
2144964 at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
2144965 what usually happens is if you lose you go silent for a while
2144966 but hillarys supporters havent gone silent theyre still out there in the news
2144967 but we didnt fight fire with fire it couldve been scorched earth but thats not where our guy is
2144968 anyone in his armchair would be able to contemplate the whole of creation
2144969 i got a great big house on the hill here and a great big blonde wife inside it and a great big pool in my backyard and another great big pool beside it sonny its money that matters
2144970 you dont want to be the one to tell the other that they didnt make it or if they did
2144971 i got my e mail and waited about an hour before going downstairs
2144972 he asked me if i had gotten an e mail and i was like yeah
2144973 thats a good thing because were close friends on and off the field
2144974 that helps with team chemistry and i think its unique that were the same age and have the experience with youth national teams and the olympic team in qualifying and starting today the games
2144975 its definitely nice to have a familiar face along for the ride
2144976 we dont have the pressure of being the no 1 favorite but we do have the pressure of putting u s soccer on the map and i think we are the team to do that
2144977 i dont think ill ever realize what an honor an privilege it is
2144978 i think it will really set in when i walk out for that first game and soak it all up
2144979 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2144980 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2144981 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2144982 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2144983 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2144984 the team feels like they finally have weapons up front
2144985 i have deliberately and consciously written respectfully about islam and mohammed i envisioned that my book would be a bridge builder
2144986 cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
2144987 in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
2144988 might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
2144989 im not a member of any organized political party im a democrat
2144990 when targeting very different groups they have to say very different things the candidates and parties walk a tightrope during conventions
2144991 some of whom had expressed concern about the new contract provisions relative to paid holidays
2144992 in an effort to be responsive tyson asked the union to reopen the contract to address the holiday issue and the union agreed to do so
2144993 this means that in 2008 only shelbyville employees will have nine paid holidays
2144994 will have the option of selecting another day as a paid personal day at their discretion
2144995 the amended contract will be extended throughout the life of the current labor agreement and will recognize the following eight 8 paid holidays new years day martin luther king jr
2144996 the union is pleased that the will of the workers in shelbyville to observe and celebrate eid al fitr will be guaranteed as a paid holiday
2144997 the rwdsu believes that this is an important sign of respect of deeply held religious beliefs this labor day the workers at shelbyville have more reason than ever to be proud of being part of a union
2144998 this is not the image we want from tyson foods
2144999 for over a hundred years labor day has stood as a symbol to honor the working men and women of this country but for the past few years traditions like labor day have been under attack this time its gone too far and we as patriotic americans must draw our line in the sand
2145000 but in america we do not need to allow substitutions and exceptions to our beloved heritage
2145001 and have asked them to reconsider their contract actions and work to restore americas image as a nation built on noble traditions
2145002 we must stand up for working people of shelbyville bedford county and all tennesseans stand up to defend our heritage rights and privileges in celebrating the american worker for all that they have done to make this country great
2145003 my impression was when i read it in the paper they should have that day labor day and if they want to take off that other day eid al fitr that should be up to the company
2145004 but i didnt think it was a good thing to do as a business
2145005 i think tyson needs to go back and reconsider this
2145006 they need to sit down and renegotiate this they had honorable intentions to try to do something for the plant but its a mistake
2145007 most of them think that when people come to america they should do as americans do instead of americans changing and adapting things the way they do in language traditions and all of that
2145008 get along with people how to work with people and how to be kind to one another
2145009 not them the refugees so much but the way they are used to operating in their country which is more aggressive than most people that come here
2145010 their custom is to negotiate everything but here you go into stores you dont negotiate you make your mind up if you want to pay for it or not
2145011 theyre here they are part of the community they are part of the economy so its not like you can just tell them to leave but tyson is the reason why they are here they are attracted by them they come from different places to work here
2145012 the anglican communion has from its beginning experienced groups who decided they can no longer be part of it
2145013 what is challenging at the moment is that some groups have decided they can depart and yet retain the benefits of being part of the episcopal church or the anglican church of canada and to us that is a non sequitur
2145014 made a point of telling bob woodruff that his wifes cancer was in remission when he began the affair with hunter
2145015 repeatedly lied during his presidential campaign about an extramarital affair
2145016 stiil mcgreevey who claimed he was so broke that his fiancier boyfriend
2145017 our view of what the olympics should be and their view is very different
2145018 their view is that this is not only an opportunity to show the positive side of china the prevailing view of the government is to stop something terrible from happening
2145019 the main impact on the amount of oil actually recovered from anwr is likely to occur after 2030
2145020 we have the newer condos but they have the pool
2145021 all we want to do is be part of a community
2145022 just stay on your side and well stay on ours
2145023 how did you get in here we have security we have cameras
2145024 i feel that were the guys that every time we go there that everybody has to pay attention to us in order to win
2145025 now there are times we dont win obviously but were still in the hunt every time and got a shot
2145026 its not like were not running well because we are
2145027 weve just had some circumstances that havent gone our way youll have that
2145028 in nine years weve won four races if you cant be counted as a factor after that i dont know when they do count you as a factor
2145029 youd like to think that with that many people back on offense that the offense would click sooner
2145030 i had to get some small shoulder pads because these are for junior varsity players but the number of kids is overwhelming
2145031 we had 38 players regularly come to the summer workouts
2145032 despite a softening global economy we delivered solid gains in worldwide sales pc shipments and profits
2145033 the global spotlight is shining on lenovo our products and our people
2145034 were all hopeful that the market is going to continue to improve
2145035 were working diligently on taking down costs and cutting expenses
2145036 the people walking in darkness have seen a great light on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned
2145037 weve been at this all morning im hungry lets break for lunch
2145038 ok lets get japanese i know of a great place in kyoto japan

2145046 come hither nan see here a book of prophecy thus he saith is the king this the queen and this is myself with my head off
2145047 if i thought it true though he were an emperor i would not myself marry him with that condition
2145048 yes nan i think the book a bauble yet for the hope i have that the realm may be happy by my issue i am resolved to have him whatsoever might become of me
2145049 that matters not for it is foretold in ancient prophecies that at this time a queen shall be burnt but even if i were to suffer a thousand deaths my love for you will not abate one jot
2145050 good christian people i am come hither to die for according to the law and by the law i am judged to die and therefore i will speak nothing against it i am come hither to accuse no man nor to speak anything of that whereof i am accused and condemned to die but i pray god save the king and send him long to reign over you for a gentler nor a more merciful prince was there never and to me he was ever a good a gentle and sovereign lord and if any person will meddle of my cause i require them to judge the best and thus i take my leave of the world and of you all and i heartily desire you all to pray for me o lord have mercy on me to god i commend my soul

2145056 i think henrys sister mary knew deep down that her brother would forgive her for marrying brandon she was his favorite sister and brandon was his best friend
2145057 another interesting thing is that henrys elder brother arthur died at the age of 15 his son henry fitzroy at the age of 17 his legitimate son edward at 16 all after fairly healthy childhoods but felled by sudden fragility almost as though they wasted away

2145077 i went through that once and im not going to do it again if anybody says im a racist im not going to stand for that
2145078 i would rather lose a war to win a political campaign that is patently offensive when his campaign ran an ad suggesting that i had refused to visit wounded troops because i couldnt have tv cameras with me reporters immediately said that was patently false im not going to sit back and let my record be distorted
2145079 offer each party a chance to showcase its best ideas
2145080 will allow people to see senator mccain and myself interact in a way that keeps people more honest because youre standing there face to face
2145081 when you have to stand on a stage with your opponent as ive done in other campaigns you obviously have a tendency to improve the relationship when you have to spend time with somebody i think it changes the equation
2145082 i think the notion that somehow as a consequence of not having joint appearances senator mccain felt obliged to suggest that id rather lose a war to win a campaign doesnt automatically follow i think we each have control over ourselves and our campaigns and we have to take responsibility for that
2145083 we responded with an offer of doing five debates rather than the traditional three which the mccain campaign declined
2145084 is that both the conventions and the debates will offer formats for senator mccain and myself to make our best case to the american people at a time when the american people will be paying attention
2145085 and ultimately the best corrective to overly negative campaigns are the american people who are not interested in a lot of bickering but are interested in whos got the best answers for the country

2145183 ive been living in an incredible state of pressure and scrutiny
2145184 what matters to me though is how the court overall is perceived and how if it was not kwame kilpatrick sitting in that seat if it was john six pack sitting in that seat what would i do and that answer is simple
2145185 the judge did what he thought was right we dont agree
2145186 annes charm lay not so much in her physical appearance as in her vivacious personality her gracefulness her quick wit and other accomplishments
2145187 she has the soul of an angel and a spirit worthy of a crown
2145188 the king has been very good to me he promoted me from a simple maid to be a marchioness then he raised me to be a queen now he will raise me to be a martyr
2145189 i do not say i have always shown him king henry that humility which his goodness to me merited i confess i have had jealous fancies and suspicions of him which i had not discretion enough and wisdom to conceal but god knows and is my witness that i have not sinned against him in any other way think not i say this in the hope to prolong my life god hath taught me how to die and he will strengthen my faith as for my brother and those others who are unjustly condemned to die i would willingly suffer many deaths to deliver them but since i see it pleases the king i shall willingly accompany them in death with this assurance that i shall lead an endless life with them in peace
2145190 this is the king this is the queen and this is me with my head cut off
2145191 your wife i cannot be both in respect of mine own unworthiness and also because you have a queen already your mistress i will not be
2145192 it is foretold in ancient prophesies that at this time a queen shall be burnt but even if i were to suffer a thousand deaths my love for you would not abate one jot
2145193 remember me when you do pray that hope doth lead from day to day
2145194 and if any person will meddle of my cause i require them to judge the best
2145195 next to my own mother i know no woman alive that i love better
2145196 sometimes i wish all spaniards were at the bottom of the sea
2145197 she was never described as a great beauty but even those who loathed her admitted that she had a dramatic allure her dark complexion and black hair gave her an exotic aura in a culture that saw milk white paleness as essential to beauty her eyes were especially striking black and beautiful wrote one contemporary while another averred they were always most attractive and that she well knew how to use them with effect
2145198 annes charm lay not so much in her physical appearance as in her vivacious personality her gracefulness her quick wit and other accomplishments she was petite in stature and had an appealing fragility about her she shone at singing making music dancing and conversation not surprisingly the young men of the court swarmed around her
2145199 to us she appears inconsistent religious yet aggressive calculating yet emotional with the light touch of the courtier yet the strong grip of the politician a woman in her own right taken on her own terms in a mans world a woman who mobilized her education her style and her presence to outweigh the disadvantages of her sex of only moderate good looks but taking a court and a king by storm perhaps in the end it is thomas cromwells assessment that comes nearest intelligence spirit and courage
2145200 do you think the people actually believed the incest charge
2145201 anne certainly knew the risk she was taking getting involved with henry
2145202 do you think you could hold his interest a little longer
2145203 if you would all join in with me tomorrow marks the 472nd anniversary of the beheading of anne boleyn on may 19 1536 i thought it was only right for us to recognize it watch the tudors read ives biography of the famous queen or do your own thing heres to anne woman lover queen and mother of elizabeth
2145204 i think they are doing just fine with how things are proceding ive only seen the first season but i think if they sped things up farther it could loose viewers as to whats going on they have to explain things so that viewers will understand whats going on and its a show that i believe can only go so far so they dont want to speed things up to much because then within a couple seasons the show will be cancelled because there isnt anything else they can do with the story
2145205 you are my wife you are not my minister you are not my chancellor but my wife
2145206 so you were a f g virgin thats not the point
2145207 anne i want to say something to you if it pleases you to be my true loyal mistress and friend to give yourself to me body and soul i promise ill take you as my only mistress i wont have a thought or affection for anyone else
2145208 what did henry want to hear when he gave instructions for an investigation into annes behaviour do you think that he wanted to hear that she was guilty so that he would be able to get rid of her and marry jane seymour with a clear conscience or would he have preferred to be reassured that she had never betrayed him in any way
2145209 i wonder what henrys subjects really thought about the game of musical chairs henry was carrying on with his wives of course they didnt dare say what they really thought
2145210 also the sons were bastard children since henry wasnt married to either woman when the children were born and who wants bastard children on the thrown

2145213 did you authorize or were you aware of the 3 billion off balance sheet transaction which resulted in the restatement at a subsequent time
2145214 this has nothing do with off balance sheet its just the opposite worldcom put it on the balance sheet rather than charging it to expenses thats a screwed up question
2145215 how did you not see some red flags when the taxes the filed taxes of worldcom were so different from what they reported as their earnings would that have helped you possibly uncover the fraud
2145216 that was the most hilarious question asked that poor lady failed to understand that tax treatment is governed by the internal revenue code that congress creates accounting is treated by gaap generally accepted accounting principles there are two sets of rules there its not uncommon at all for transactions to have different requirements under the tax code than they have under typical accounting standards that was a crazy question
2145217 it seems like you keep wanting to blame the auditors but i also think people at the helm of worldcom also ought to be going to jail and heres why im a small business owner sir nothing to the magnitude of what you have but i know that my cash flow is based on my checkbook and my bank statement and whether youre a little business or a big business it looks like to me you would catch on the checkbook if nothing else a 3 8 billion misreporting error
2145218 i dont know what hes trying to say do you there was a cash outflow your checkbook wouldnt tell you how to classify that cash whether its a capital expenditure or not
2145219 mr sidgmore when you operated an internet backbone company did you ever expense capital expenditures
2145220 if he had expensed capital expenditures he would have been writing things to the income statement that should have been put on the balance sheet he would have been understating his earnings most internet companies were not of that inclination
2145221 the public has a certain amusement in the wild west atmosphere of business but we really think of the accountants as being the cavalry and in this instance its sort of like you were general custer and the people at worldcom were the indians and you got slaughtered

2145228 but his health is so bad that if he were sentenced to even a short period of time it is likely he would die
2145229 i sometimes cant find a good place to practice because our national stadium is always being used by footballers
2145230 ive been doing this four years but i do it because i love to run
2145231 i think the one that costs 200 would be more suitable for an olympic marathon
2145232 the olympics games is 10 times tougher than even the asian games
2145233 we really dont have a hope of winning any medals
2145234 i am very glad to go to beijing for the olympics
2145235 this was my gift to them to leave my job in the best way possible
2145236 just when you need employees to take risks to turn the organization around they take to the trenches
2145237 top management was good about guiding you instead of getting a direct order
2145238 it sounds hokey but its like a family everyone knows that we have to chip in to make sure that everyone else is okay
2145239 we were in new territory here our people dont have experience with this
2145240 i knew that this wasnt part of the hp way and its not what bill and dave would have wanted
2145241 but if they were faced with the same situation they would have had to do the exact same thing and even though all of us probably lost sleep worrying about our jobs and whether wed have them or not i know ned probably lost a lot more having to get up there in front of everybody and make this announcement and have to let go people in his family
2145242 we were brutally honest with them about what were doing what drove the decision what the timing is whats going to happen
2145243 that honesty and integrity up front is critical if you dont have it you lose their hearts and their minds and they wont be productive
2145244 i think every evangelical knows thats kind of a loaded up term and i think someone wanted to get some action on a blog and i think it was very unfortunate and quite disingenuous to title the article that way
2145245 it did get attention on the blog and the term repents provided
2145246 i wondered what horrible immoral thing have i done i think it was a poor choice of words actually i dont think when you make a strategic adjustment it qualifies under the term repent i think every evangelical knows thats kind of a loaded up term and i think someone wanted to get some action on a blog and i think it was very unfortunate and quite disingenuous to title the article that way
2145247 repenting is not a new experience for us weve made a number of major course corrections over the years
2145248 to turn irreligious people into fully devoted followers of christ
2145249 without a proper understanding of what were actually doing these days
2145250 cap also calls on the ministry to initiate immediate measures to weed out similar games and halt sales and also their use in contest dont steal devil may cry 4 for the pc
2145251 we must have a commitment to the church in madrid and throughout spain it is a commitment but above all apostolic character that concerns us all nautrally it concerns the pastors and faithful but very directly and specifically the young people
2145252 to recognize and remember the great heritage of holiness and missionary spirit inherited from our elders for the sake of young people from spain and the world
2145253 are unequivocal proof of the success of the pastoral way and the way chosen for the gathering of youth of the third millennium with jesus christ
2145254 i understood i should consult with my superiors the holy see did not voice any objections and cardinal joseph zen of hong kong encouraged me to go therefore i decided to accept
2145255 however while the leaders of the six largest religions in hong kong were invited to beijing only in the case of the catholic church was an invitation not sent to the highest authority i am embarrassed because our government ignored cardinal zen and invited me instead
2145256 a number of catholic leaders are still in jail or under house arrest
2145257 suffer for our catholic faith and for their fidelity to the holy father
2145258 was mobilized like one big family to help the victims
2145259 i wish china would give the same importance to the five interconnected aspects of democracy human rights the rule of law justice and peace
2145260 we christians underscore the spiritual development more with st paul we like to compare our spiritual journey with a race towards the goal in order to reach the prize that god has prepared for us in christ jesus

2145342 maybe if the goverment started to look after our own a little more
2145343 all singing from the same hymn sheet get rid of nice
2145344 no matter what the cost if it adds extra days to someones life we should give it them
2145345 meteorologists are among the few people trained in the sciences who are permitted regular access to our living rooms and in that sense they owe it to their audience to distinguish between solid peer reviewed science and junk political controversy if a meteorologist cant speak to the fundamental science of climate change then maybe the ams shouldnt give them a seal of approval
2145346 the bidder didnt pay me for the pez dispenser he bought
2145347 we will have this in hand for sen clinton should this be needed
2145348 its been a tradition since the late 1800s its a nominating convention you vote you nominate someone and you come out unified i dont see how alienating 1 800 delegates gives you party unity when we walk out of the stadium
2145349 hillary delegates feel like were not welcome needed or valued
2145350 i may be on my own on this but does anyone else feel that ambition is sometimes lacking in the christian community not publicly in sermons or from preachers rhetoric but by individuals in their own unique situation it can produce thoughts of climbing ladders reaching above your means trampling on people and putting yourself first do these thoughts have to go hand in hand with ambition
2145351 some of the best photographs ive seen in three years of this module
2145352 just remember fans take losses much harder than the majority of players do
2145353 its a math issue whether its televised live or not we still have production costs its the same cost
2145354 so wed have to do the math on whether it would make sense to produce it and show it later i will say weve had good support in terms of advertising for chiefs games
2145355 not fair you made it seem like marty schottenheimer was coming back to resurrect our pathetic team instead the coach with the most boring speaking delivery in the history of football will be doing radio ugh
2145356 io ho begli occhi un bel sorriso belle gambe ma
2145357 depuis une autre victime sest manifest e et des v rifications ont montr que ce policier aurait eu des comportements similaires entre 2005 et 2008 avec quatre personnes
2145358 he said i was his love and he was going to get me one way or another
2145359 i am a farmer i am very poor i am not like a prince
2145360 i really dont want bloodshed but if you still fail to obey me blood must flow
2145361 hun sen has no vision he has a genius for one thing political survival this is his biggest achievement
2145362 hor namhong will meet his thai counterpart on august 18 hor namhong will then pay a courtesy visit to the thai king
2145363 both countries must narrow the conflict and expand friendship and cooperation
2145364 we cannot just carve out thailand to put it in the sky or move our land away
2145365 we will coexist for tens of thousands of years to come
2145366 at the pagoda we ask that only buddhist nuns laymen and buddhist monks stay not troops from either side
2145367 i would like to respectfully inform the thai king that if any other cambodian except hun sen was prime minister there would be war on the border since july 15 but not me
2145368 a border dispute should not turn the two countries into enemies in all domains
2145369 fighting is easy its ending the fight that is difficult
2145370 if you do not participate in the lawmaker swearing in ceremony the seats won by the srp and other opposition parties will be divided among others meaning the cpp and possibly funcinpec
2145371 fulfill their obligation to the 2 million citizens who voted for them at the assembly
2145372 it wasnt something that they were willing to make time for
2145373 in addition to doing a lot of great things yahoo had a sense of arrogance of we invented this
2145374 if we are going to succeed we have to have people with different attitudes
2145375 this is a classic example of bringing the adults in to mind the children
2145376 every dollar that comes in from any premium service is incremental to us
2145377 but where i wouldnt give them good marks is building the future of the company we basically have yahoo from two years ago with some new stuff
2145378 this will be the foundation for the companys entry into the broader world of subscription services
2145379 yahoos a novice when it comes to delivering software services
2145380 weve been in this game for five years now weve learned a lot of hard lessons
2145381 this is the real battle front over the next 15 months
2145382 jerry i say that everything you guys did as a startup company was brilliant in the climate that existed up to that point in time how to grow as fast and as wide as possible with the business of advertising to support it
2145383 but times change companies change the company had to diversify and in order to diversify to start building business you have to have focus
2145384 before coming i kept reading about this guy from hollywood i guess that was me
2145385 but this guy from hollywood was also a business person who ran a worldwide set of media assets when i first got to warner bros co ceo bob daly and i faced many of the same opportunities and problems as yahoo we had a company with a great brand and many aspects of the company were really broken but there were great opportunities
2145386 i couldnt get my arms around something that had so many pieces and so many people running so many things large and small
2145387 there was no specific strategy no specific point of view
2145388 yahoos original mission was to grow as fast as you can and put things out there and see what works
2145389 nobody knew what would work now you have a much better indication of what makes sense
2145390 this is being married to each other not just participating in some form or fashion and competing in others
2145391 this is going to come down to how good are you at services how well do you communicate with your customers we have a superb opportunity to be no 1
2145392 were waiting so work doesnt interrupt summer programs and operations at the pool
2145393 therefore weve decided to leave it open and suffer the losses each day
2145394 its unfortunate but were glad to keep it open for kids to enjoy the rest of the season
2145395 considering the age of the pool and its about 53 years old it is in pretty good shape
2145396 we in liberia recognize that there is a higher authority
2145397 tell pat robertson and please present this to him as a token of our appreciation
2145398 did you know that pat robertson can leg press 600 pounds
2145399 yeah says the trainer robertson nods and 90 more pounds are added he pushes out ten abbreviated knee bends his face quickly turning red under his white hair then he ambles out of the machine
2145400 im not going to settle for anything less robertson says
2145401 pats a very attractive guy to the masses he really is says lowell morse who oversees robertsons investments as head of robertson asset management
2145402 he is going to be a more attractive guy in my opinion when hes dead people are not going to realize the impact he had until hes gone
2145403 personality oriented media ministries generally do not last long beyond the death of their founder leaders
2145404 some religious media personalities try to usher their offspring into the celebrity fold almost as a kind of religious monarchy
2145405 but there is no historical evidence that this kind of monarchical passing of the ministry will be successful
2145406 in something like this pat has a real heart to help people
2145407 the media criticize pat because hes a minister and hes a businessman but thats what they needed there
2145408 i have explored for gold in various places in africa
2145409 and bukon jedeh is still one of the most interesting and one of the most prospective places i would look for gold
2145410 we did not want to be involved in anything that could be seen as defrauding prior investors
2145411 firestone tire does business over there coca cola does business over there
2145412 this man taylor is not the monster everybody makes him out to be like most african countries they dont have the same ethics we might have in this country but at least theyre trying to do something there is no controversy at all after this liberia for jesus
2145413 they didnt address the merits of the case at all
2145414 the bicameral legislature exercises little independence from the executive branch
2145415 the judiciary is subject to political influence economic pressure and corruption
2145416 there was absolutely no involvement by us in this zip zero none
2145417 first you want to screw him then you want to pray for him
2145418 the best thing that can happen to the rosses is if we decide to hightail it out of there with all the negative publicity
2145419 then they just walk in with all of our results and whatever weve done at this point were not going to do that weve taken our hits already
2145420 when pat robertson acquired cenco refinery he had a letter from the district long before i was ever there which assured the new owner that all the permits would be reissued
2145421 he and i have never spoken directly about any cenco issue he always dealt through lawyers
2145422 right now the directive to me is to keep costs to a minimum
2145423 im the guy who discovered this stuff i know its there
2145424 i went out there and worked seven years of my life so i know its there
2145425 what i hope is the finest industrial park in all of santa fe springs
2145426 my retirement some day in the future could have a similar impact on the ministry i loved
2145427 my son gordon has taken over more and more of the on air role as well the internet operation and the overseas operation and he has got a real heart for it
2145428 i think if i were to pass off the scene in a few years i think that weve got enough strength in various positions that that wouldnt be any problem
2145429 we zouden het zonde vinden als het programma blijft liggen en willen het heel graag alsnog laten zien
2145430 of en wanneer we het eerbetoon gaan uitzenden is nog niet bekend
2145431 avro zendt eerbetoon jos brink niet uit wegens olympische spelen
2145432 i would say cautiously optimistic theres maybe a 75 chance that the fight will happen
2145433 to make 147 would be a big concession on oscars part
2145434 we hope the olympic games will bring china closer to the world and will show the world that china is strong and has stood up
2145435 we squeezed some time out even though we were extremely busy
2145436 our car broke down so we took a coach instead to come here
2145437 it took us seven hours but we simply had to be here to feel the olympics watching tv is totally different from being here in person
2145438 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2145439 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2145440 it used to be jammu amp kashmir now its jammu vs kashmir
2145441 this leaflet is the constitution for joining the al mumahidoon
2145442 this is one of the best decisions made by the leader moqtada carrying weapons should only be left to the people who are specialized in this
2145443 no os llegar is a ellas ni ellas se llegar n a vosotros porque ciertamente har n inclinar vuestros corazones tras sus dioses
2145444 if elected i will support a comprehensive fair and clean elections system for philadelphia
2145445 i cant tell you how many people across the state and the nation have come up to me and complained about this problem
2145446 people say i want my money back people are getting their money back
2145447 on energy democrats in office means a return to the 1970s
2145448 everytime i say aids is a black disease it irks everyone
2145449 whites call me racist and blacks say you have stigmatized us
2145450 whats more disturbing is there are so many people more concerned about what other people think of us than whether we survive or not
2145451 over the last five years the white house and congress have increased spending on hiv prevention treatment and support programs for low income countries dramatically at the same time that domestic spending has remained all but flat
2145452 i think its better if they think ill of us and were alive instead of thinking well of us and were dead
2145453 the issue of screening for prostate cancer is frankly an area of medicine that remains somewhat unsettled
2145454 while its clear there is benefit to a significant number of men its equally clear that many men end up being diagnosed and treated for cancers that would likely not have caused them any significant harm
2145455 could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
2145456 ainsi comme lindiquent les chercheurs du centre de recherche interdisciplinaire en droit de lenvironnement de lam nagement et de lurbanisme crideau le tourisme et les loisirs mettent environ 10 des gaz effet de serre produit par lhexagone
2145457 this is the 77th grave that we have discovered at this site since our digging activities has started ten years ago with lebanese british financing
2145458 we have discovered earlier this year a jar also belonging to the canaanite period i e to 2 000 years b c where a skeleton for a newborn baby had been found
2145459 is the first excavation site in old sidon that is located on a land owned by the general directorate of antiquities
2145460 we can say that through the discoveries we have been making at this site we will be able to draw a graph showing the history of this ancient mediterranean merchant city since 3000 bc
2145461 among the institutions that have taken in charge the financing of our project are the british old house institution the issam fares foundation the national cement company the hariri foundation and sidons school network in addition to byblos bank
2145462 ortega nos va a colocar en una situaci n especial frente al f tbol vamos a disfrutar m s del f tbol y menos del coraz n
2145463 yo creo que la situaci n que l va a vivir en mendoza es distinta a la que vive en buenos aires ac no hay tantas tentaciones y adem s viene con su familia

2145465 passage of sb 1322 comes just as three americans were arrested and aggressively removed from tiananmen square by communist police for peacefully protesting their opposition to chinas brutal violation of human rights
2145466 the peaceful activists capitalized on international media coverage of the beijing olympics to draw attention to chinas human rights abuses including forced abortions and sterilizations religious persecution of its citizens and the denial of fundamental civil liberties
2145467 will banish from current law the ability of schools to fire teachers for being communists it will also allow communists to use public school property for their meetings
2145468 during floor debate on the bill monday afternoon minority republican lawmakers attempted to at least insert language banning terrorists from teaching in schools or using government property as they conspire against innocent american citizens the amendments to sb 1322 were voted down by the majority democrats

2145474 ive been fighting this battle for tibet for 45 years
2145475 thousands of tibetan refugees to this day are having to escape from tibet because china has totally taken over the country
2145476 they are never held accountable and the united states government will undoubtedly brush this off as another case of oh well they didnt know they were in the united states

2145482 there must be some reason why they have brought us here
2145483 the taliban are trying to reassert control not only in terms of fighting and taking control of a town militarily but also trying to put into place other structures of government that will build legitimacy
2145484 im afraid like all fathers are afraid for their children its like all other sports its more dangerous than playing chess if thats considered a sport but i dont think its more dangerous than horseback riding and riding competitions

2145491 the oldest celebrity in the world old enough to remember when dancing was a sin
2145492 i want america to know im like totally ready to lead
2145493 whereas millions of africans and their descendants were enslaved in the united states and the 13 american colonies from 1619 through 1865
2145494 lingering consequences of the misdeeds committed against african americans under slavery and jim crow
2145495 whereas slavery in america resembled no other form of involuntary servitude known in history as africans were captured and sold at auction like inanimate objects or animals
2145496 whereas africans forced into slavery were brutalized humiliated dehumanized and subjected to the indignity of being stripped of their names and heritage whereas enslaved families were torn apart after having been sold separately from one another
2145497 whereas the system of slavery and the visceral racism against persons of african descent upon which it depended became entrenched in the nations social fabric
2145498 whereas slavery was not officially abolished until the passage of the 13th amendment to the united states constitution in 1865 after the end of the civil war
2145499 whereas after emancipation from 246 years of slavery african americans soon saw the fleeting political social and economic gains they made during reconstruction eviscerated by virulent racism lynchings disenfranchisement black codes and racial segregation laws that imposed a rigid system of officially sanctioned racial segregation in virtually all areas of life
2145500 whereas a century after the official end of slavery in america federal action was required during the 1960s to eliminate the de jure and de facto system of jim crow throughout parts of the nation though its vestiges still linger to this day
2145501 whereas african americans continue to suffer from the complex interplay between slavery and jim crow long after both systems were formally abolished through enormous damage and loss both tangible and intangible including the loss of human dignity the frustration of careers and professional lives and the long term loss of income and opportunity
2145502 whereas a genuine apology is an important and necessary first step in the process of racial reconciliation
2145503 whereas an apology for centuries of brutal dehumanization and injustices cannot erase the past but confession of the wrongs committed can speed racial healing and reconciliation and help americans confront the ghosts of their past
2145504 whereas it is important for this country which legally recognized slavery through its constitution and its laws to make a formal apology for slavery and for its successor jim crow so that it can move forward and seek reconciliation justice and harmony for all of its citizens
2145505 now therefore be it resolved that the house of representatives 1 acknowledges that slavery is incompatible with the basic founding principles recognized in the declaration of independence that all men are created equal 2 acknowledges the fundamental injustice cruelty brutality and inhumanity of slavery and jim crow 3 apologizes to african americans on behalf of the people of the united states for the wrongs committed against them and their ancestors who suffered under slavery and jim crow and 4 expresses its commitment to rectify the lingering consequences of the misdeeds committed against african americans under slavery and jim crow and to stop the occurrence of human rights violations in the future

2145516 right now we are feeling very good about the frequent flier miles committed to barack obama
2145517 john mccain would basically have to fly to antarctica and back four times just to be in shouting distance of us
2145518 with the miles already committed to him barack obama qualifies for a free trip to maui
2145519 obama was flying to afghanistan iraq and germany racking up tons and tons of miles
2145520 we cant do better until we dedicate ourselves to a new direction

2145522 the amount being paid to the music industry even though their games are entirely dependent on the content we own and control is far too small
2145523 my primary purpose was to say thank you for the work that youve done to provide additional encouragement and support
2145524 i respect them i appreciate them i want them to be safe in doing their jobs i want them to be respected by the public
2145525 just because a couple people did some really bad things some horrible things some outrageous things the rest of our dhs workers should not be painted with a negative brush
2145526 maybe the language was a little vivid but as a parent and as a city worker and as a worker at dhs i feel the same way
2145527 you want to see the passion from the person in charge under no circumstances should someone die on your watch
2145528 he needs to see us as the professionals we are he needs to see that were risk takers we risk our lives every day we go places where police wont go
2145529 i think hes willing to help us become a better agency i think he knows weve made a lot of strides

2145540 when he came into the weavers to replace pete seeger which was a pretty tall order he not only did that but he brought so much of his own talents to bear that it was overwhelming it really was

2145548 actually maybe not upbeat but it does have some up tempo songs anyway its as close as ive gotten to making the record ive always wanted to make
2145549 i knew that i wanted this one to be more adventurous with strong solid rhythm tracks and beautiful airy touches to support the songs
2145550 there was nothing off limits nothing that was too weird or too difficult i could tell him that i wanted something to sound like fairies dancing around a maypole and hed know what button to push to get that we were able to add a lot more layers without overshadowing the songs themselves

2145569 why is the floor as low as i can go
2145570 and every person who cares about the conservative movement and every person who cares about the republican party had better stop and say to themselves
2145571 and every person who cares about the conservative movement and every person who cares about the republican party had better stop and say to themselves
2145572 and every person who cares about the conservative movement and every person who cares about the republican party had better stop and say to themselves
2145573 i clearly acknowledge that bill clinton hey jumpjack please explain this statement of yours
2145574 bush will go down as one of the most inept and corrupt presidents in the history of this country

2145576 im barack obama and i dont take money from oil companies or lobbyists and i wont let them block change any more
2145577 its unfortunate that senator obama is using false advertising to explain why he can be trusted to do something about energy prices
2145578 senator obama says he doesnt take campaign contributions from oil companies but the reality is that exxon shell and others are among his donors
2145579 i am a single woman who has worked shift work all my life sometimes never seeing another woman on the job for weeks
2145580 exxon mobil reported more than 10 billion in quarterly profits
2145581 he met with the oil and gas companies 40 times so is it any wonder than that the energy laws that were written were good for exxon mobil but they are not good for you
2145582 actually raised taxes on oil companies and made the largest investment in renewable energy in our nations history
2145583 i dont take money from oil companies or washington lobbyists
2145584 two major bundlers for his campaign george kaiser and robert cavnar are oil company ceos
2145585 except now exxons making 40 billion a year and were paying 3 50 for gas
2145586 the reality is that exxon mobil shell and others are among his donors

2145590 we find this paper about online gaming economy from ratz sinka to be a strong testament to our industrys growth and potential it clearly outshines the detractors and any negative points
2145591 i dont want to ruin the parade but somme humility and financial restraint in a sector dominated by online gaming economy firms would go a long way
2145592 huprich cano really put well when saying it aint over with online gaming economy until its over
2145593 and im with them all the way until its time to move on
2145594 time especialy when it comes to online gaming economy is of the essence we dont have time to mess around and blow our chances at what could be a fantastic opportunity
2145595 i never thought that online gaming economy would come this far i knew that investments from private individuals would surely come but from the major investment houses no way
2145596 speaking from a personal viewpoint i believe that the more we can get out of this time period the better
2145597 we can all look forward and predict financial success for all involved but that comes tempered with a bit of risk right now

2145603 his sickness i dont know it just gave me a lot of energy to fight
2145604 he tells me every day the reason i cant give up is because of you thats why i train hard
2145605 he cant make it to china but hes going to get to see me in the olympics
2145606 from the time he was 6 years old i would take him from school to boxing from school to boxing

2145611 if thats truly the case why go through the charade and expense of military tribunals
2145612 well we can read the second one the next time im in the tub
2145613 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been 30 years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
2145614 toadies kick off todays first update with new dates for october and november
2145615 it is shameful that a journalist should have been so ill treated by members of the israeli special police and left injured has israel no regard for law and order and are those responsible being prosecuted
2145616 there are many examples showing that israel does not respect law and order for example see physicians for human rights israel
2145617 holding health to ransom gss interrogation and extortion of palestinian patients at erez crossing
2145618 from the many reports it appears to have been a racist attack the sort of thing mr prosor and his colleagues often complain about im disappointed he has not responded to our concerns
2145619 being jewish myself i am particularly concerned that israel live up to its stated ideals of decency actions speak louder than words

2145633 we spend more time worrying about storage than any other aspect of the total computing environment
2145634 emc lives or dies by its ability to continue to sell into its traditional fortune 500 base
2145635 if it cant figure out how to do that then emc as we know it goes away
2145636 open software software that would make using an ibm shark as easy for emc customers as using an emc symmetrix
2145637 the software guys shouldnt worry about protecting our hardware leadership role says tucci
2145638 for a hardware company to get into this game they need to write software that will enable customers to buy less hardware
2145639 thats like microsoft coming out with a set of linux products but tucci sees things differently hes betting that both halves of emc will steal market share from rivals before they start bumping into each other
2145640 maybe buying cheaper boxes is where many of us will end up
2145641 in the short term im looking at emc as a full blown turnkey solution for my storage needs
2145642 granted emcs building a credible software portfolio but well compete highly with them in that space
2145643 eh doesnt really matter just read the damn email and get on with your life

2145649 john mccain is the eddie haskell of politics you can attribute that to me and hell kill me for it
2145650 the beginning of the end of his respect for and friendship with mccain
2145651 he had slipped some highly technical questions to mcclure to ask mofford questions she wouldnt be prepared to answer or expected to answer
2145652 hurt me more than anything to be set up like that
2145653 you will recall during my speech at the dinner for the president in phoenix i announced that you were going to give half of the funds you raised to the state republican party i am told by the party that you still owe them 35 000 and unless you pay all of it or most of it they cannot meet their payroll next wednesday
2145654 a farce mccain famously sponsored a law designed to control special interests grip on washington but at the same time he took money from those interests
2145655 he traces his environmental awareness to the sainted rep mo udall an arizona democrat who took mccain as a young congressman under his tutelage to environmentalists thats like saying you learned about civil rights by driving around alabama with martin luther king jr
2145656 i have always wondered why john mccain has done nothing to fix the problem he must either not see that a problem exists or does not choose to do anything about it it would seem that it would be in everyones best interest to come to terms with the situation and do whatever is necessary to fix it there is so much at risk during my short tenure at avmt i have been surrounded by what on the surface appears to be the ultimate all american family in reality i am working for a very sad lonely woman whose marriage of convenience to a u s senator has driven her to distance herself from friends cover feelings of despair with drugs and replace lonely moments with self indulgences
2145657 that was devastating to me that he brought in a reporter i thought that was crossing the line and it destroyed me
2145658 im sure i would have accepted the offer to go the hospital as well i cant blame lewis but maybe the sight of the legendary mo udall in his final sad days wasnt mccains to share
2145659 im willing to admit that ive been going through a very bad time with depression

2145670 a man with 10 wives would collapse and die but my own power is given by allah that is why i have been able to control 86 of them
2145671 i dont go looking for them they come to me i will consider the fact that god has asked me to do it and i will just marry them
2145672 to my understanding the koran does not place a limit and it is up to what your own power your own endowment and ability allows
2145673 god did not say what the punishment should be for a man who has more than four wives but he was specific about the punishment for fornication and adultery
2145674 as soon as i met him the headache was gone
2145675 god told me it was time to be his wife praise be to god i am his wife now
2145676 i said i couldnt marry an older man but he said it was directly an order from god
2145677 i am now the happiest woman on earth when you marry a man with 86 wives you know he knows how to look after them
2145678 as you sit here if you have any illness i can see it and just remove it

2145687 maybe the snow in the cascade mountains isnt in such immediate peril from global warming after all despite previous studies suggesting a warmer climate is already taking a bite out of washingtons snowpack theres no clear evidence that human induced climate change has caused a drop in 20th century snow levels according to a new study by university of washington scientists

2145706 im very relieved today we played better than for weeks and it was so important
2145707 i was pleased with my performance but it was that last save in the final minute that gave me most satisfaction
2145708 i told them to have a few beers even kick the cat to get this out of their system hopefully we have three more massive games to come
2145709 we gave it a right go in the second half and if it hadnt been for their keeper we would have been okay

2145716 i think that we are having an important debate about how we keep the country safe

2145719 deliver exhilarating performance for a strictly limited number of discerning customers
2145720 out of touch with the real world and out of touch with real people
2145721 nothing unfair or unusual about setting new ved rates for cars that have already been purchased
2145722 it is intrinsically unfair and unusual to introduce a new system of taxation that applies to families who have already purchased their vehicles and are unable to sell them
2145723 they go too fast to catch when we do they dont take any notice and anyway they kill themselves eventually
2145724 i currently have a v reg bmw 318 ti compact automatic and require a vehicle that has the same 1 200 1 400kg towing capacity as i pull a small caravan about six times a year to sites within 100 miles
2145725 for the remainder of the time i need an economical five door vehicle that has a manual gearchange and a high driving position by which i mean something that you climb up into rather than sit down low but it shouldnt be too big my wife would prefer it to be as small as possible
2145726 i like the look of the two wheel drive nissan qashqai 1 5 diesel but it might be too large i have about 15 000 to spend including the money i will get back on the bmw
2145727 theres no demand for petrol off roaders and re sale values are plummeting owners of large petrol 4x4s could find themselves stuck with their cars as dealers steer clear of thirsty off roaders
2145728 we have learned from trade insiders that a number of individual customers are unable to part exchange a large petrol 4x4 for their next car
2145729 the market for 4x4s has become tougher following the governments announcement in the budget of revised vehicle excise duty rates for higher polluting cars
2145730 this may mean from time to time that they are less inclined to take certain vehicles in certain circumstances
2145731 from a manufacturers point of view f1 has to be the pinnacle of technology
2145732 when people say it cant be relevant because the cars are so different theyre missing the point its all about training engineers and the development of long term intellectual property will our f1 system find its way onto a honda civic probably not but in terms of some of the thinking and technologies developed it will
2145733 not long ago if manufacturers had pressured a team to run a particular system they would have been told where to go but now its related to what sells on monday morning
2145734 were told the test engineer had become complacent about safety
2145735 i think they rather threw the baby out with the bathwater
2145736 kers will see f1 take on a pioneering role providing a baptism of fire for innovative concepts whose service life and reliability have not yet reached the levels required for series production vehicles
2145737 im not sure were claiming necessarily that anything were developing in that area can go onto road cars
2145738 but if kers can help energy efficient cars seem sexy or macho rather than just for people who wear open toed sandals then it will have done some good
2145739 you are right and you should remember that when you are older
2145740 oh miriam i have been thinking i should make some rules for my life
2145741 let souls who are striving for perfection particularly adore my mercy because the abundance of graces which i grant them flows from my mercy i desire that these souls distinguish themselves by boundless trust in my mercy i myself will attend to the sanctification of such souls i provide them with everything they will need to attain sanctity the graces of my mercy are drawn by means of one vessel only and that it trust the more a soul trusts the more it will receive souls that trust boundlessly are a great comfort to me because i pour all the treasures of my graces into them i rejoice that they ask for much because it is my desire to give much very much on the other hand i am sad when souls ask for little when they narrow their hearts

2145752 this sales campaign gives investors the opportunity to commemorate their purchase on a date that has special significance from the sheer exclusivity and luxury associated with homes in burj dubai to the aesthetic environment offered by polo homes the properties on offer will appeal to connoisseurs who are keen to invest in some of the most prestigious properties in dubai
2145753 the special 188 days payment plan also provides investors an interesting payment option making the purchase on 08 08 08 truly memorable
2145754 its not only in the carpet industry its in furniture curtains bedding everythings gone quiet in that area its bloody tough
2145755 exclusive sex parties such as fever and killing kittens have brought swinging from the sub culture to the mainstream on any given night behind unmarked doors in the capital attractive young couples are stripping off to watch their partners join writhing orgies on beds as big as swimming pools
2145756 some columnists i can think of on other newspapers make me blush with their weather vane we thought gordon was marvellous but he has proved us wrong schtick as if somehow the man whom they had so praised for the decade of his slow premiership campaign had grown unexpected hair and teeth on a full moon night last autumn
2145757 dont you recall all your guff about him not being flashy like bad blair but that being a big plus you changed oh guardianistas not him he wasnt as good as you said he was and he isnt as bad as you now paint him
2145758 weve been working on this online gaming economy project for 8 months now
2145759 and we have yet to see daylight the finance team is getting ansy because we have spent much more than we have gained
2145760 i think its a win win situation for everyone involved
2145761 and consumers stand to benefit greatly as well in the long run competition will only drive prices down and produce higher quality products
2145762 while the numbers team is crunching data my team and i are focusing on important online gaming economy human behavioral patterns and psychological trends including buying patterns the impact of economic recession or boom and governnment mandates
2145763 this is an investment in our future and as such will not yield immediate results we need to look for the return 10 even 15 years down the road
2145764 its not really a race to see who finishes first as much as it is a general goal that we should all get to at some point in the future
2145765 this just goes to show that proper research balanced with strict budgeting and investment practices will result in higher profits and corporate growth were excited and our investors are pleased many of them long time online gaming economy shareholders have been able to retire on the profits from our stock growth alone
2145766 our online gaming economy research division has been able to harness the power of data mining and databasing to better understand to best way forward
2145767 and as a result finding key online gaming economy market trends can be easily made through simple algorithms
2145768 you may not instantly see why i bring the subject up but that is because my mind works so phenomenally fast and i am at a rough estimate thirty billion times more intelligent than you let me give you an example think of a number any number
2145769 of the speech you once made i long to hear it
2145770 for a short while on account of my miraculous and bitterly resented escape from a fate almost as good as death in the heart of a blazing sun you can guess from my condition
2145771 how narrow my escape was i was rescued by a scrap metal merchant imagine that here i am brain the size of never mind
2145772 he it was who fixed me up with this leg hateful isnt it he sold me to a mind zoo i was the star exhibit i had to sit on a box and tell my story whilst people told me to cheer up and think positive give us a grin little robot they would shout at me give us a little chuckle i would explain to them that to get my face to grin wold take a good couple of hours in a workshop with a wrench and that went down very well
2145773 i long to hear of the speech you gave in the marshes
2145774 there was a bridge built across the marshes a cyberstructured hyperbridge hundreds of miles in length to carry ion buggies and freighters over the swamp
2145775 here in the swamp it was going to revitalize the economy of the squornshellous system they spent the entire economy of the squornshellous system building it they asked me to open it poor fools
2145776 i stood on the platform for hundreds of miles in front of me and hundreds of miles behind me the bridge stretched
2145777 did it stretch like a silver thread far out into the invisible mist
2145778 this is what i said i said i would like to say that it is a very great pleasure honour and privilege for me to open this bridge but i cant because my lying circuits are all out of commission i hate and despise you all i now declare this hapless cyberstructure open to the unthinkable abuse of all who wantonly cross her and i plugged myself into the opening circuits
2145779 a car scrappage scheme should be considered by the treasury to offer drivers of high emission cars a payment to trade in their vehicles for more efficient models
2145780 there is nothing intrinsically unfair or unusual about setting new ie more expensive vehicle excise duty rates for cars that have already been purchased
2145781 certainly our survey of 18 500 members said that 55 per cent were making fewer journeys by car because of fuel costs
2145782 the drop in traffic is an indication that fuel costs have really hit home both families and business is suffering as a result
2145783 you get traffic growth when the economy is booming and it drops when it is in trouble
2145784 although we welcome fewer deaths from drink driving it should not be forgotten that the total figures for accidents and casualties is actually up
2145785 this should ring alarms bells at the department for transport and make them their reliance on speed cameras to tackle all aspects of road safety
2145786 academics have estimated that setting a lower limit could save dozens of lives each year the most successful campaign would be one that had a clear message that no amount of alcohol is acceptable any amount affects your reaction times and judgment
2145787 for such a campaign to work the government needs to reduce the drink drive limit
2145788 this is a battle for a lower limit and a simpler communication message no alcohol is the only possible safe amount when driving
2145789 this is a significant reduction particularly as the figures have hit a plateau in recent years we believe that higher profile police enforcement and continued campaigning about the risks is having an effect
2145790 two thirds of aa members are in favour of a lower drink drive limit and therefore we believe that this is something the government should consider
2145791 youth activism has to be data based activism young people need to know the real facts before they get involved to properly analize the situation

2145800 summit systems have an enviable reputation in the provision of ancillary equipment to the plastics industry with the recent addition of a recycling division their expertise in recycling is growing and we are very happy to be working with them
2145801 its a major issue for them it will be something they will be looking into but they dont know why or what exactly happened yet
2145802 she has never been in any trouble besides this that doesnt mean she didnt do what was alleged
2145803 but she didnt get a fair trial and everyone has a right to a fair trial
2145804 im going to shoulder this remorse and guilt for the rest of my life
2145805 especially in a matter as high profile as this the court was disappointed that much of the testimony particularly as it related to public figures within the state of new jersey and the dirty laundry associated therewith needed to be aired in the public and in the press
2145806 the mcgreeveys clearly had agendas as previously addressed their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable

2145811 my biggest challenge in neuro is trying to figure out what not to do
2145812 we think that there is more headroom for growth in the neuromodulation space than any other part of medtronic
2145813 it was like they threw a switch and my body just totally relaxed for the first time in years
2145814 it can really substantially improve symptoms to the point where with many patients you dont even know that they have parkinsons
2145815 putting a probe in someones brain is a major operation
2145816 for about the last 20 years the conventional view for policy makers in washington is that any activity in the arctic and antarctic is basically related to science
2145817 i expect that sometime in the near future there will be an issuance of what they call a national security presidential directive to lay out new policy in the arctic
2145818 this will deal with more issues of sovereignty security presence and things like that
2145819 the question is what do we want to project up here
2145820 the primary mission right now is the maritime boundary line with russia keeping foreigners from stealing alaskan fish
2145821 the way we do that is either put ships or airplanes or both on the boundary line and we do a barking dog routine
2145822 the fleets are further north than ever because the species are moving north
2145823 they could just look at the business checking account and see the growth trends
2145824 thats going to make it a little more difficult for entrepreneurs to get the capital they need
2145825 its a tool to be able to give your customer access to capital under extended terms that fit their business model
2145826 you would think in a time of economic downturn that a loan program like the sbas which is specifically designed for borrowers whose loans cant be underwritten in the conventional sense would be expanding
2145827 quite the contrary is actually happening in the market now
2145828 were hearing lenders say thats the straw thats breaking the camels done
2145829 lower demand for capital and a tightening of credit standards by some lenders
2145830 yes there is tightness in the overall credit market and a slowdown of the macroeconomy
2145831 but if you have a good business plan and youve already been working with your community bank theres money to be had

2145841 dries heeft in een jaar 240 keer op het podium gestaan daar gaat het toch om
2145842 veel dingen die hij met dries heeft gedaan wil ik niet ik ga bijvoorbeeld niet bij spuiten en slikken zitten
2145843 maar sterren dansen op het ijs lijkt me wel erg leuk
2145844 ik ben dario en ik ben niet dries ik ben een heel ander persoon zoals dries over priv dingen praat bijvoorbeeld dat zou ik niet doen enkele weken geleden lag mijn vader niet best kijk daar praat ik niet over

2145847 and the taj asked me what i did and i said i sell these airbrush thermal shirts i had the suitcase full of them and i tell him he can have any shirt in the suitcase but when i opened it up your hawaiian shirt is on top and he says he wants that one so i gave it to him he says he thinks its perfect for the photo shoot for the new album cover and it fit him too because he is xtra large so i let him have it you never would have worn it anyway
2145848 the disturbance has been dealt with and everything is back to normal
2145849 where can i start how can i reach them what can i do
2145850 we are delighted to report that during the last six months we have increased our total assets by 817 and our current assets by 7 449 while at the same time reducing our current and total liabilities by 39 we look forward to implementing the next phase of our project

2145872 the city in question is beijing in the year 2000 but the answer is berlin 1936 the history of the modern olympics is too short and the world is too small to forget murder
2145873 the olympics may be a triumph for china but by intensifying the pressures for change the games are quite unlikely to be a triumph for chinas waning communism in fact the games may accelerate its fading
2145874 theyll have a technically good olympics but the world will also see a different china ive been going there for a long time and its changing by the minute

2145890 alexander payne no fueron suficientes sin embargo para que las grandes distribuidoras de hollywood ofrecieran a miller una oferta atractiva que garantizara una buena distribuci n del film en eeuu
2145891 es la primera vez que nos hemos implicado en la distribuci n pero no hab a otra opci n porque los inversores en sundance cre an que iban a perder su dinero
2145892 trabajos que jam s hubiera imaginado como negociar mano a mano con las compa as que dise an los carteles de las pel culas o las que los colocan en los taxis de nueva york
2145893 es dif cil pero no imposible nos dimos cuenta que pod amos hacer lo mismo que hacen las grandes distribuidoras se trata de contratar a las mismas personas que trabajan para ellos y es algo que se puede hacer por menos dinero del que se piensa
2145894 por menos dinero del que un estudio dice porque son los estudios los que suben los precios
2145895 ha sido como una ultramarat n pero hacer una pel cula no es barato y qu menos que lograr una distribuci n digna podr a decir que distribuir una pel cula es m s dif cil que dirigirla
2145896 lo m s complicado es que la gente se entere de que una pel cula existe y eso es lo que vale m s dinero pero parece que hemos encontrado a los mejores profesionales en ese sentido
2145897 hemos aprendido mucho en el a o que hemos invertido en este proyecto hemos estudiado mucho para saber qu pasos dar as que ahora vamos a seguir ese camino

2145904 our business was built on print over 30 years ago and this partnership renewal with quebecor world shows our commitment to the importance of printed media in the canadian marketplace we look forward to working with quebecor world as we actively pursue our growth objectives over the next 7 years
2145905 we are pleased to extend our long term partnership with canada wide media
2145906 our ability to provide an unparalleled service approach allows us to deliver the value and quality an independent industry publishing leader such as canada wide media ltd demands
2145907 we believe the benefits of an information rich mail stream will be evident for our mailers and the entire mailing industry and investments to make that a reality will prove to be very much worthwhile
2145908 however given the volatility of the economy decreasing mail volumes and our own financial situation it would be premature for us to commit to a pricing structure for the intelligent mail barcode at this time
2145909 its been 40 years of change and growth and still our company remains a strong franchise network in an exciting industry
2145910 we have consistently taken a leadership role in adopting new technologies to help our customers meet their business objectives our experience in north central and south america asia the middle east and europe contribute to our industry leading position worldwide we are excited about our recently opened first location in india and see a bright future for our brand
2145911 our printing and marketing services bring even more opportunity for our network of franchisees
2145912 working with customers to help them grow their business is the cornerstone of the sir speedy brand
2145913 our performance has been very positive in the face of a deteriorating market
2145914 while we were not surprised by the negative turn in the market the erosion was much more significant than anyone envisioned earlier in the year it is evident that the market turmoil is not restricted to housing or commercial construction but has spilled over into the larger economy in light of the weakening credit conditions and the lack of confidence in the financial sector in spite of these headwinds and the slower pace of acquisitions in the first half of the year our core operating strengths strong sales focus and cost containment practices continue to deliver value to our customers and our shareholders the best evidence of this is found in our strong gross margin performance
2145915 commercial construction and non aec accounts continue to provide a solid base of business in spite of the general economic softness and we continue to acquire market share through selective acquisitions and an aggressive sales stance
2145916 by managing our costs and working capital closely the company continues to generate strong cash flow from operations our year to date cash from operating activities is 61 5 million compared to 45 4 million for the same period in 2007
2145917 earlier this year when we provided our sales and earnings guidance our projection of revenue deterioration was primarily related to residential construction since then the financial markets have weakened significantly causing a slowdown in private investment a key driver of non residential construction this slowdown combined with uncertain economic conditions is triggering project delays and cancellations in spite of these adversities we still believe the companys sales and earnings will be within the original annual range we projected due to our position in the market place and our operating strength
2145918 thus we are reaffirming our guidance for 2008 and expect revenues to be in the range of 720 million to 760 million and that earnings per share will be in the range of 1 52 to 1 60 on a fully diluted basis
2145919 we understand that the needs of our customers vary and were dedicated to providing them with a number of service options that best fit their business requirements whether it be hardware or software related
2145920 our goal is to enhance the functionality of kodaks already top of the line integrated solutions which include a full range of ctp devices plates plate line equipment proofing and workflow systems

2145941 with the plastics recycling sector now more technically advanced recycling and waste management companies are looking to recover new materials they have a real need to accurately identify them particularly the composition of complicated mixtures to improve efficiency and recycling rates
2145942 the most important consideration from my point of view was performance standards for uk food packaging production are exceptionally rigorous and value overrides price having said that i am happy that all the numbers felt right
2145943 clearly the product we supply must be perfect in terms of both colour and polymer any error on our part bears a heavy financial cost and just as importantly raises questions about our commitment to quality
2145944 we are creating success in a growth industry that while it has a low public profile is making a massive contribution to the green agenda that is driven both by public concern and government legislation

2146083 weve called corporate headquarters about the new jerseys because weve had some inquiries
2146084 but they just started printing last night so it might be a while before we get them in thats really up to the people at headquarters

2146097 theres always been pressure on a new york team period to win the fact that the giants won the super bowl last year ups the ante a little bit
2146098 it takes chemistry and to me thats the most important thing you can have all the talent in the world but if the chemistry is not there it doesnt matter i think we can achieve that

2146123 the consumer will not be aware that publishers are making the book 17 5 cheaper anyway because of the vat on e books
2146124 all of our costs of producing e books are in addition to our normal production costs

2146136 he was good about everything chester was pretty much your typical thoroughbred he was kind of adhd and he always had a bit of a mohawk which really just fit his personality

2146138 i bought poggio from cassie as a 5 year old
2146139 he was a very happy trail horse it was obvious from the first day he was in the barn he was something special brave brave brave and jumped like a rubber ball i owned him for 5 months and then traded the majority of him for a very fancy 4 yo i had sold to amy 7 months before so she could have a top prospect at a reasonable price
2146140 the trainer at my barn kept in contact with the gal who bought him
2146141 and she would tell me chester went to japan or that he went to the east coast and won a bunch of money other people have always called me and told me did you know this a friend called the other day and asked me if chester was going to the olympics again so googled it and found out that he was
2146142 he loved to work and he loved to go i think its very cool that he has been so successful in eventing because obviously that is what he is meant to do

2146168 whether mcnamee falsely charged clemens with using steroids in new york texas or on the moon is of little consequence it simply does not change that mcnamees conduct was calculated to and did harm clemens where he lived and worked

2146177 the whole reason i involved you in this research was to catch mistakes like this before they got too far
2146178 may i remind you tom that you are not supposed to be working with me and i am not supposed to be involved with this project at all
2146179 i cant help it if the assumptions you made were proven to be incorrect i might also remind you that in july of last year i warned you about the potential for exactly this set of circumstances to arise but you insisted on publishing your preliminary results
2146180 kolmogorovs paper just appeared in russian in an obscure on line publication ive seen to it that their web server will be experiencing some difficulties for the next few days at least then it will take time for the paper to be translated and to appear in a publication that will be read by anyone important it will be at least a month probably more before anyone pieces together the implications of his findings that should give you time to decide how to handle this
2146181 you got a load of upss and power conditioners in there
2146182 ive been here for the last couple of days hooking all this stuff up
2146183 if youve got the power gear i can get this on line and get the hell out of here before someone mugs me
2146184 barring a fundamental flaw with his measurement equipment id say theyre pretty solid
2146185 it would have to be some sort of calibration error that only affected certain measurements but did so consistently
2146186 huh what sorry i dozed off ive hardly slept this week
2146187 i was saying there is one thing i can look into that might refute kolmogorovs findings
2146188 ive been snooping around and ive intercepted some e mail from guys at washington university in st louis theyre looking into the same quantum decoherence phenomenon kolmogorov is but they have a radically different theory of the underlying mechanics if theyre correct youre quantum computer design can probably be salvaged but i need to see their data
2146189 of course i just need you to get a port opened up in the lab firewall and ill take it from there i e mailed you the ip address
2146190 good then you should get some sleep it will take me a while to look over their information and you have that meeting with mcmullen this afternoon you probably shouldnt let on that anything is wrong yet
2146191 he doesnt suspect a thing were still on track to get that prototype funding from darpa

2146193 you have no idea no insight and certainly no imagination i mean adam really that was the best you could come up with

2146221 libraries knock down borders and open the door to knowledge they play a key role in educating and emancipating the public they help develop individuals and communities that are informed creative and educated
2146222 some four out of ten people worldwide visit libraries in canada libraries spend an estimated 2 7 billion annually in quebec more than half of people age 15 and older visit a library at least once a year all of which is to say that our libraries are alive and well
2146223 a unesco world heritage site and the cradle of the french language and culture in north america quebec city is without doubt the ideal venue for such an event
2146224 this book is about change change is a fact of life for libraries their ability to change has allowed them to thrive through the centuries
2146225 but today their metamorphosis is more spectacular than ever from villages to megalopolises libraries have become thriving places of gathering more animated and democratic than ever furthermore they have become models for the promotion and communication of culture and knowledge thanks to their intelligent and remarkably creative use of emerging virtual capabilities
2146226 libraries sit at the heart of the community and are informed by everything that takes place around them
2146227 by reaching out into the community itself as the examples in this book demonstrate canadas library network has created unprecedented access to information made a difference in individual lives and make a vital contribution to the knowledge society of the 21st century
2146228 it is wonderful to be in a country so renowned for its multiculturalism a subject that is cherished by librarians the world over this aspect of canadian diversity will inspire much of our work and i cant wait to experience the diversity that all the worlds cultures have brought to this country without wishing to claim that we operate on the same level i cant help but remark the similarities between the canadian model and our work at ifla
2146229 i am convinced that all of us librarians and information professionals are helping build a better world every time we take part in programs organized by our communities regions institutions businesses governments and international organizations in spite of our economic social and political differences we each make a significant contribution by providing access to resources of interest to everyone information and knowledge
2146230 its horrible its a disaster according to information to hand there are at least 10 dead

2146234 the world has never needed mutual understanding mutual toleration and mutual cooperation as much as it does today

2146255 we need to put this information across what is the best medium
2146256 based upon the totality of the evidence we had gathered against him we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
2146257 we are now beginning the process of concluding this investigation
2146258 ivins had a history of mental health problems and was facing a difficult time professionally in the summer and fall of 2001 because an anthrax vaccine he was working on was failing
2146259 there is ample evidence in this case pointing to dr ivins as the individual who drove to princeton to mail those letters
2146260 the governments press conference was an orchestrated dance of carefully worded statements heaps of innuendo and a staggering lack of real evidence all contorted to create the illusion of guilt by dr ivins
2146261 the government would have the american people believe that after seven years and more than 15 million dollars of taxpayer money they have found the individual responsible for the heinous attacks of the fall of 2001
2146262 was a devoted husband and father who worked for more than 30 years to defend his nation and its soldiers against the terrible effects of anthrax
2146263 now our peacekeepers are waging a fierce battle with regular forces from the georgian army in the southern region of tskhinvali
2146264 our side had tried to send a list of names including the envoy to north korea but the north refused to receive it saying the envoys visit to kaesong is not appropriate
2146265 you should consider life sentencing possibilities when you consider the facts in this case
2146266 a consequence so great that others will think again before they ally themselves with osama bin laden or the next osama bin laden
2146267 in the near term at least we would consider him an enemy combatant and still a danger and would like that he still be detained for some period of time
2146268 his doctor visited him last night and said he has to have a little operation but it is not serious
2146269 i thought for people who want a vegetarian food why not apply the same quality standards you find in an artisan bakery

2146273 she is very enthusiastic about the need for a unified party
2146274 i think he should be taking this very seriously as the last thing the democrats want to do is project a divided image at the convention
2146275 the fate of musharraf now lies in the hands of chief of army staff general ashfaq kayani

2146277 an international train from krakow to prague ran into a collapsed bridge which fell on the rails
2146278 there were many poles on the train and unfortunately apparently at least one of the dead is polish
2146279 but theres a problem with the way the globalization paradigm has evolved it doesnt really explain most of what is happening in the world thanks to innovation manufacturing productivity has doubled over two decades employers now require fewer but more highly skilled workers technological change affects china just as it does the america william overholt of the rand corporation has noted that between 1994 and 2004 the chinese shed 25 million manufacturing jobs 10 times more than the u s
2146280 the central process driving this is not globalization its the skills revolution were moving into a more demanding cognitive age in order to thrive people are compelled to become better at absorbing processing and combining information this is happening in localized and globalized sectors and it would be happening even if you tore up every free trade deal ever inked
2146281 the globalization paradigm leads people to see economic development as a form of foreign policy as a grand competition between nations and civilizations these abstractions called the chinese or the indians are doing this or that but the cognitive age paradigm emphasizes psychology culture and pedagogy the specific processes that foster learning it emphasizes that different societies are being stressed in similar ways by increased demands on human capital emphasis added if you understand that you are living at the beginning of a cognitive age youre focusing on the real source of prosperity and understand that your anxiety is not being caused by a foreigner
2146282 people dont generally know that rabbits are the third most popular house pet and the third most abandoned house pet
2146283 rabbits are a relatively new problem for shelters and the increasing numbers over the past few years is disturbing we have escalated over the years from a dozen or so per year to 96 in the last year
2146284 we manage to adopt out about 75 percent of the rabbits
2146285 the whole principle of fostering as opposed to sheltering rabbits is that if they become socialized they can become litter box trained and get to be part of a family
2146286 that really helps us get to know their personalities and sell their personalities to prospective adopters
2146287 they are great for working people because they are what we call crepuscular which means that opposed to noctural or diurnal they are active at dusk and dawn and they are very inactive during the daytime when most of us are at work
2146288 the picture of a furry bunny with a small child is precious but its not very realistic

2146326 this audit has made it crystal clear that we are not meeting the needs of these students and tells us this is how we can
2146327 but i also saw passion teachers and instructional assistants who were very committed
2146328 as tough as this review is in many ways the community owes a note of thanks to the superintendent for having the guts to ask for what they knew was going to be a very tough assessment
2146329 nobody is running away from the solution theyre saying bring it on

2146340 we are identifying downside risks since a number of months and i would say that the information that we had very clearly suggests the materialisation of those risks
2146341 the main development over the past month seems to be that the ecb is more downbeat about the euro zones current growth situation and the outlook
2146342 unchanged interest rates seem highly likely in the near term at least as mr trichet indicated that the ecb continues to hold a neutral stance
2146343 this worrying level of inflation rates results largely from both direct and indirect effects of past sharp increases in energy and food prices at the global level
2146344 we have one needle in our compass and we take absolutely all the information that is pertinent to identify the risks for inflation in the months and years to come
2146345 the peak of the price of oil and commodities was very abnormal and not corresponding to equilibrium in price but we will see what happens
2146346 volatile captures pretty well the evolution that we have seen in the most recent period
2146347 risks to price stability remain clearly on the upside and have increased over the past few months
2146348 we are at a fairly early stage of this but there are areas of the iranian economy that are vulnerable to targeted sanctions whether they be in the lng liquefied natural gas sector investment in the oil and gas sector imported refined products reinsurance other financial areas which are areas we would look at if we are looking to increase the pressure on the iranian leadership
2146349 a number of other countries that we would want to involve in those discussions as we go forward
2146350 what we are seeing now is oil off equities are up and thats dragging treasury yields up
2146351 it seems that weve got a lot of selling based on the stronger dollar
2146352 energy demand destruction and the dollar return have formed a quiet alliance to bring the oil market down and today the louder of the two is the dollar
2146353 theres going to be more speculation of ecb rate cuts later this year
2146354 do not stay on the same bus on the same train on the same plane in the same buildings or any place the chinese are
2146355 investors had set high expectations on the olympic games hoping they would lift market sentiment and lead to a significant rebound
2146356 this anticipation supported the market so that we didnt see any big falls last month but faith collapsed a couple of hours ahead of the games
2146357 confidence in building positions became very shaky especially for those short term buyers who are very sensitive to government support
2146358 there are investors who bought these stocks on the hope that beijing would rescue the markets before the olympics and that these stocks would rise more sharply
2146359 it is my duty as president of the jury to inform you that this military commission sentences you to be confined for 66 months
2146360 i would like to apologize one more time to all the members and i would like to thank you for what you have done
2146361 look past the choppiness and bias in the data and what youll see is a fundamental weakness in the labour market
2146362 well see the unemployment rate peaking at 6 3 percent next year
2146363 with the end of the stimulus checks we know consumers are spending more cautiously and we continue to see a pronounced paycheck cycle at the end of the month
2146364 this is telling us that sales have stabilized this raises some hopes that weve flattened out which doesnt mean the problem is solved
2146365 we have to see how much of that is attributable to bank owned properties or foreclosures which seem to be driving the markets right now
2146366 there are some bottom feeders coming in to buy some of these homes in distressed situations
2146367 international law cannot bind a state against its will simply because we dont have a world government a world legislature or a world judicial system
2146368 the will of the international community cannot be imposed on states just like that
2146369 the court cannot order a state to change its systems
2146370 if for no other reason governments need to respect the judgments of the icj out of long term self interest
2146371 even if a state does not like a ruling of the icj it is in everybodys long term interest that we have an international system governed by the rule of law
2146372 most countries are sensitive to negative international judgments they dont want to be shamed
2146373 because it is apolitical and a relatively cheap alternative to international arbitration
2146374 the edwards and funk families werent the only winners in the aug 2 powerball drawing

2146382 my dad was an antique collector and mum a home sewer so the combination i think just bred a natural intuition for vintage couture and sewing and i love the process of turning an old outfit or fabric into something fresh ready to be loved all over again

2146390 first of all if i asked larry the reason the dog has a different name id never be on the show again
2146391 secondly larry might have sentimental reasons why a dog is named a certain way maybe it will somehow tie into the storyline
2146392 probably he doesnt care if he offends a dog on the set
2146393 i believe dogs are emotionally crippled by this double standard and its only a matter of time until they ask us not to cross their picket lines
2146394 this storm didnt hit us like we predicted and its nothing more than a much needed rainy day we now return to our regular programming because theres really nothing to report here

2146397 in 24 hours its gone from 1 55 to 1 50 which is highly unusual that changes your game plan for the marketplace
2146398 this is payback time for the european currencies against the dollar
2146399 these currencies have to retreat to better reflect the sharp deterioration in economic fundamentals in the euro zone region this is not to say theres been an improvement in u s fundamentals
2146400 confirmed that the window of opportunity for further rate hikes has been slammed shut by the cold blast of negative data releases that swept through the euro zone in the last few weeks
2146401 lots of investors have been on high commodity prices and a low dollar and those bets are getting destroyed
2146402 there is a fundamental rethink in the alignment between the major currencies with the u s dollar coming out on top despite ongoing turmoil in the financial sector
2146403 wal mart is on pace to give more money to house democrats this cycle than house republicans for the first time ever

2146412 esential e sa nu politizam dezbaterea despre raport si despre justitie din pacate aproape toate interventiile facute de politicieni dupa aparitia raportului nu au aratat decit o indirjire in a politiza realitatile
2146413 am cerut mai multa fermitate in interventii si folosirea armamentului din dotare
2146414 comanda ipj a solicitat politistilor mai multa fermitate in interventii si folosirea armamentului din dotare la aparitia unui pericol nu am avut foarte multe infractiuni de ultraj la politist insa conditiile in care s au comis ridica o serie de probleme daca a ajuns ca un reprezentant al politiei sa fie agresat de un primar este strigator la cer
2146415 am avut cazuri de politisti care au fost amenintati cu ciini de catre persoane din lumea interlopa sau chiar cu moartea
2146416 pe noi nu ne ajuta cu absolut nimic stam sa ne injure sau sa ne loveasca toti borfasii ca nu putem sa le facem nimic daca ii iau mai tare ma reclama pentru purtarea abuziva si de multe ori desi stiu ca am dreptate evit folosirea fortei
2146417 eu unul nu ma simt deloc protejat legea parca e facuta pentru infractori daca trag chiar si un foc de avertisment dau o saptamina intreaga declaratii peste tot daca nu trag poate fugi si eu sint de vina ca l am avut si l am scapat pe cel care zice ca legea actuala il protejeaza pe politist il invit in strada sa vada cum e sa te scuipe sau sa iti dea pumni in cap toti nenorocitii
2146418 intr adevar in forma actuala legea nu ne protejeaza astfel de infractiuni de ultraj la politist slabesc autoritatea institutiei si se pune in pericol rolul pe care il avem faptul ca nu se iau masuri este un lucru grav
2146419 cel care abuzeaza plateste este la fel si acum un politist care greseste raspunde atit in fata legii cit si disciplinar am avut cazuri de politisti care au fost destituiti pentru purtare abuziva astfel de comportamente nu trebuie sa limiteze insa capacitatea de a actiona a celor corecti
2146420 forma initiala era foarte buna si ne simteam mai protejati atit noi ca magistrati cit si politistii ei sint cei mai expusi si nu sint protejati absolut deloc ar trebui sa se modifice atit limitele de pedeapsa cit si continutul si sa se revina la forma anterioara pedeapsa pentru ultraj era de 12 ani si s au facut numeroase arestari pe astfel de cazuri
2146421 la propunerea ministrului internelor si reformei administrative mira si snppc vor initia un demers comun adresat ministerului justitiei care va avea ca fundament analiza cazurilor de ultraj comise impotriva politistilor in ultimii doi ani document intocmit de catre inspectoratul general al politiei romane demersul comun va fi adresat ministerului justitiei pentru a fi avut in vedere in contextul elaborarii noului cod penal
2146422 saving is all his idea and all his work all we do is trust him enough to let him do it its gods gift from start to finish we dont play the major role if we did wed probably go around bragging that wed done the whole thing no we neither make nor save ourselves god does both the making and saving
2146423 why would i do that for you when i dont even do it for my own family
2146424 sounds like its a sign you are becoming more assertive conquering your fears and also not letting people take advantage of you

2146429 but when we bury anger inside us its always buried alive
2146430 on thursday may 27 1999 darrell scott the father of rachel scott a victim of the columbine high school shootings in littleton colorado was invited to address the house judiciary committees sub committee what he said to our national leaders during this special session of congress was painfully truthful they were not prepared for what he was to say nor was it received well it needs to be heard by every parent every teacher every politician every sociologist every psychologist and every so called expert these courageous words spoken by darrell scott are powerful penetrating and deeply personal there is no doubt that god sent this man as a voice crying in the wilderness
2146431 since the dawn of creation there has been both good amp evil in the hearts of men and women we all contain the seeds of kindness or the seeds of violence the death of my wonderful daughter rachel joy scott and the deaths of that heroic teacher and the other eleven children who died must not be in vain their blood cries out for answers
2146432 the first recorded act of violence was when cain slew his brother abel out in the field the villain was not the club he used neither nca the national club association the true killer was cain and the reason for the murder could only be found in cains heart in the days that followed the columbine tragedy i was amazed at how quickly fingers began to be pointed at groups such as the nra i am not a member of the nra i am not a hunter i do not even own a gun i am not here to represent or defend the nra because i dont believe that they are responsible for my daughters death therefore i do not believe that they need to be defended if i believed they had anything to do with rachels murder i would be their strongest opponent
2146433 i am here today to declare that columbine was not just a tragedy it was a spiritual event that should be forcing us to look at where the real blame lies much of the blame lies here in this room much of the blame lies behind the pointing fingers of the accusers themselves
2146434 i wrote a poem just four nights ago that expresses my feelings best this was written way before i knew i would be speaking here today
2146435 men and women are three part beings we all consist of body soul and spirit when we refuse to acknowledge a third part of our make up we create a void that allows evil prejudice and hatred to rush in and reek havoc spiritual influences were present within our educational systems for most of our nations history many of our major colleges began as theological seminaries this is a historical fact what has happened to us as a nation we have refused to honor god and in so doing we open the doors to hatred and violence and when something as terrible as columbines tragedy occurs politicians immediately look for a scapegoat such as the nra they immediately seek to pass more restrictive laws that contribute to erode away our personal and private liberties we do not need more restrictive laws
2146436 as my son craig lay under that table in the school library and saw his two friends murdered before his very eyes he did not hesitate to pray in school
2146437 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed

2146442 this is like a family reunion of sorts because when youre in an industry like ours youre pretty much a big family so you see people which you havent seen for years and people who you spent a lot of time going up and down the road with and its always a pleasure to get back together and reminisce and share old stories
2146443 a lot of the agents at the time were telling steve to do more than what he was doing and that his matches werent exciting enough i told him dont change anything i said if you do the same thing everybody else does than youre just like everybody else the thing that sets you apart in this business is to be different you have a very aggressive rugged style and youre very believable i said its going to take you longer to get over and established but once youre over and established youre over for good and thats exactly what happened
2146444 when i went back to work for wwe in 94 i was in a managing and commentating role and it didnt require me needing to be on the road as much i had spent so much of my life and time on the road and that had been to the detriment of my family and i was trying to rekindle that and put the emphasis on my family i decided i wasnt going to be one of those guys who lost everything vince is running a business and he has to take people and put them where he thinks will be most effective for them and at that time what he thought would be most effective for me was to be a manager on the road i wasnt ready to be back on the road and i didnt want to be on the road
2146445 i was really unhappy with the decision once i got to wcw because wcw was the most unorganized ill run company i have ever worked for in my life there were nights when we would actually go on the air live television and they still didnt know what the outcome of the main event was going to be
2146446 i hear a lot of old timers talk about how its just not like it used to be the talent today work four days a week theyre off three days a week unless they go on a foreign tour they have better health care they make so much more money than anybody else ever did in the past and things are so much better why are you complaining

2146451 hello world this blog is for people who want to better the existing mousetrap
2146452 weve got to commend our team because they did a great job tonight
2146453 from the beginning we were solid defensively but we kept the ball too which put pressure on them
2146454 we talked about being able to move the ball offensively so the defense didnt have to do all running the whitecaps like to play long balls but they werent able to do that because they didnt have the ball as much as us
2146455 weve come out weve got the three points but now weve got to get ready to go on the road
2146456 we got a shutout the defense did well we just have to make sure everyone stays healthy
2146457 that was just a great first time strike from stephen armstrong
2146458 you dont see that very often but he has the quality to do that
2146459 we kept the ball in the second half and moved it around
2146460 they were getting their chances by putting it forward but we caught them two v two three v two we just couldnt put the ball in the back of the net on one of the counters
2146461 weve obviously had a lot of games which have probably taken some energy out of us of late puerto rico were pressing us as much as they could and didnt quit the whole game
2146462 getting a win tonight is a big thing it gets your confidence going
2146463 were getting goals all over the field and our defense got a shutout tonight were going to need all that again tuesday
2146464 we really wanted to push the tempo and take it to them
2146465 seattle is a team that likes to press even after playing three games in six days but our guys defended well created chances and really played a complete game we really never gave them a chance
2146466 weve been preparing all week for what should be a great matchup
2146467 what we dont want right now is a let down after riding high
2146468 if we keep playing like we have been i think were very hard to beat
2146469 besides having fun photographing your babies and toddlers exploring the world of animals i hope this contest will help raise awareness of how families can contribute by being eco friendly protecting the earth for this and future generations
2146470 i would think this means the divorce is going ahead

2146480 the first step toward achieving the deep satisfaction of a lifelong love with your spouse is learning to love life itself every part of it good and bad harsh and rewarding
2146481 the same is true for our future when we invest wisely we see greater dividends however unlike the stock market when we dont invest anything we can still lose and those losses can be devastating
2146482 the most profitable way to invest in the future is to pray

2146488 but if life deals you a painful piece of sand turn it into a pearl and use it in a way that can benefit you and others
2146489 for all the years we were married i had prided myself on a healthy physique so much so that i secretly doubted if barb would even be interested in me if i let myself go or worse yet got sick
2146490 but it was through this horrible trial that i saw a side of barb that had been hidden in the twenty one years we had been married i was treated to a glimpse of a woman who loved me unconditionally
2146491 it has been the greatest aid in strengthening our marriage i now see life so differently ive slowed down i smell the roses i can honestly say im glad it happened to me

2146498 my hearts just racing i just have so much adrenalin right now it really brings back a lot of memories of salt lake city and torino when i was an athlete at those games

2146513 only a small portion of data breaches get publicized and with government data breaches even fewer get identified because the government unlike business doesnt have a financial incentive to do so
2146514 its very important that the government view citizens as their customers and place more value on sensitive information

2146516 some people are turned off by unsecured business lines of credit because their credit score needs to be at least 680 thats because people do not want to admit that real estate investors do fare better with higher credit scores some people will claim that you do not need the credit scores or any money to be successful in this business but that is not true that is why we do credit restoration and help people obtain working capital through these lines
2146517 we dont mind helping people out of bad situations but we would much rather have them come to us first real estate investors especially dont have time to waste need quick money and cant afford negative inquiries on their credit reports

2146872 mom dad i want to get married to this sister because i love her
2146873 does not the lover think that his love can be concealed while his eyes are shedding tears and his heart is glowing had it not been for love you would not have shed tears at the ruins of your beloved nor would you become restless at the remembrance of the cypress tree at the high mountain how do you deny love after the testimony borne against you by such reliable witnesses love indeed transforms pleasure into pain
2146874 and among his signs is that he created for you mates from among yourselves that ye may dwell in tranquility with them and he has put love and mercy between your hearts verily in that are signs for those who reflect
2146875 o allah this is my distribution for what i have control of but please dont hold me accountable for something i cannot control
2146876 its not in your hands what can i do for you
2146877 as for loving women there is no blame on a person who has love for them
2146878 and among his signs is this that he created for you mates from among yourselves that ye may dwell in tranquility with them and he has put love and mercy between you
2146879 if you havent loved passionately or known the meaning of desire then get up and eat hay for you are nothing but a donkey
2146880 when we speak of rulings of love we must describe two things one is optional and one is not the optional love is what leads to love eyesight association etc and this is the love that you have to beware of for it may lead to unlawful acts the non optional love if it happens by the sudden look or natural passions that develop you cannot be blamed for it but its how you react to it that allah will hold you to accountable for
2146881 the first love that was ever recognized and known is the love between prophet muhammad sal allahu alayhi wa sallam and aisha r
2146882 and on the authority of the love of the messenger
2146883 for those who love each other nothing has proven as good as marriage
2146884 on my return i came to the prophet and said from amongst the men he replied two things about this hadith strike me the most the first is that the messenger salalahu alaihiwassalam is not shy to admit that the person that he loves the most is his wife aisha radiallahu anha and secondly when asked about from the men he doesnt simply say abu bakr radiallahu anhu but he still attributes it to aisha radiallahu anha by saying her father
2146885 i saw the prophet salla allahu alaihi wa sallam making for her safiya a kind of cushion with his cloak behind him on his camel he then sat beside his camel and put his knee for safiya to put her foot on in order to ride on the camel
2146886 the glance is a poisoned arrow of shaytaan whoever lowers his gaze for allah he will bestow upon him a refreshing sweetness which he will find in his heart on the day he meets him
2146887 for those who love each other nothing has proven as good as marriage
2146888 if a man whose practice of the religion satisfies you asks you for your daughter in marriage you should marry them otherwise there will be corruption in the land
2146889 i verily adorn myself for my wife the same as she adorns herself for me also i would not ask her to fulfill all the rights which she owes me so that it would become binding upon me to fulfill all the rights which i owe her
2146890 and from misery is that you love and the one who you love loves other than you or that you want good for a person and he wants to hurt you
2146891 the finest quality that a man can display in love is continence to abstain from sin and all indecency for so he will prove himself to be not indifferent to the heavenly reward that eternal bliss reserved by god for those who dwell in his everlasting kingdom neither will he disobey his master who has been so gracious to him in appointing him to be a creature worthy to receive his commandments and prohibitions who sent unto him his messengers and caused his word to be immovably established with him all this as a mark of his care for us and his benevolence towards us

2146898 last summer i made a trip to three countries indonesia singapore and india of all the countries i visited india is by far the most attractive spot india is a country with a population of one billion when i was there there were floods of people everywhere at first it was quite confusing to go somewhere getting the eyes from numerous indians but as time went by i got used to it and even enjoyed it one thing that made me shocked is the people called untouchables according to statistics 82 6 percent of indians have belief in hinduism which includes the system of caste this system divides people into four social classes brahmins kshatriyas vaisyas and sudras but untouchables are not even on the list they are the lowest class they are considered as slaves there were untouchables all around wherever i went i could see the people begging for money and food being on the streets and guess what many people were dying on the streets but no one paid attention to them to make matters worse they just accept their destiny and dont even try to make a move they take the unfair treatment for granted the ridiculous religious law has been making people live in poverty misery and agony it made me very frustrated because there was nothing i could do to help them the next thing is cows cows were everywhere huge cows were going around in a leisurely way like dogs one of my friends told me indians believe the myth that a spirit of a certain god broke into a certain cow and still exists as an image of cow that is the reason why indians never eat beef unbelievable yes thats really unbelievable what do you think of indians

2146909 while observations of relevant work environments and human behaviors in these environments is a very important first step in coming to understand any new domain this activity is in and of its self not sufficient to constitute scientific research it is fraught with problems of subjective bias in the observer we like the experts we study often see what we expect to see we interpret the world through our own personal lens thus we are extraordinarily open to the trap of apophenia

2146916 hi i am just calling to see how youre doing
2146917 i just wanted to be a seminarian because probably its better for me to be with the seminary and teach aspiring priests how to be seminarians because it took me 10 years to become a priest
2146918 i thought my vocation was to be a seminarian because everywhere i go when i left the seminary theyve been kicking me out everywhere and thats the story of my life
2146919 i had reached the point that i got tired of praying to become a priest but i persisted until i was finally ordained
2146920 the truth of the matter is i am not a healer we only have one healer and that is jesus
2146921 last night in coquitlam i heard a very powerful testimony i remember one gentleman approached me and was very very eager to share his testimony in front of thousands of people and said father you prayed over me last year here in vancouver
2146922 sometimes were always looking for a sign sometimes were always looking for miracle
2146923 but the miracle is here right now jesus is always here there is always a great miracle happening every time we go to mass
2146924 i myself taught that miracles only happen during the time of jesus that the blind was able to see the deaf able to hear the cripple was able to walk that happened only during the time of jesus
2146925 since i became a priest and in my ministry i saw it every day everything that jesus did
2146926 i can barely walk and there is so much pain around my knees before i went to the church for the healing mass

2147214 what obama voted for was a budget resolution that would have allowed most of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire in particular the resolution would allow the 25 percent tax bracket to return to its pre 2001 level of 28 percent that bracket kicks in at 32 550 for an individual or 65 100 for a married couple but as those of you who have filled out a 1040 know thats not actually how income taxes work we dont pay taxes on our total earnings we pay them based on our taxable income the urban brookings tax policy centers eric toder told factcheck org that people with taxable income of 32 000 would have a total income greater than that in 2008 anyone filing taxes with single status would be entitled to a standard deduction of 5 450 as well as a personal exemption of 3 500 so to have a taxable income high enough to reach the 25 percent bracket an individual would need to earn at least 41 500 in total income while a married couple would need a combined income of at least 83 000
2147215 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes
2147216 campaign aides to senator obama today called the charge that he voted for tax hikes on people making only 32 000 a year quote bogus they circulated an analysis stating that the resolution that obama had voted for would not have increase taxes on single taxpayer making less than 41 500 a year in total income
2147217 vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year
2147218 factcheck org a nonpartisan web site said the vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year the 32 000 figure it said was the amount of taxable income those people had
2147219 would have allowed tax rates to return to pre 2001 levels meaning that an individual with taxable income of about 32 000 would have faced a tax increase
2147220 at issue is obamas vote on a non binding budget resolution in march that called for president bushs tax cuts to expire such a step would have allowed tax rates to return to pre 2001 levels meaning that an individual with taxable income of about 32 000 would have faced a tax increase taxable income is whats left after taxpayers account for deductions
2147221 the senate voted to stand up for working families in illinois and throughout the nation
2147222 today the senate voted to stand up for working families in illinois and throughout the nation by rejecting the failed policies of the bush administration and moving our country back on track to fiscal discipline our country needs change and this budget is an important step in the right direction i commend house and senate leaders for working together to move this legislation through congress

2147226 obama statement on the senates passage of the fy 2009 budget
2147227 obamas transformation if you go by his campaign so far would mean higher income taxes higher social security taxes higher investment taxes higher corporate taxes massive new domestic spending and a healthcare plan that perhaps could be the next step to a full scale single payer system is that what most americans want someone who will fulfill a democratic policy wish list
2147228 obamas proposal would impose social security taxes on income above 250 000 per year he would continue to exempt income between 102 000 and 250 000 from social security taxes
2147229 i would roll back the bush tax cuts for those making over 250 000
2147230 are frequently subject to the highest individual income tax rates
2147231 changes in the individual income tax affect most businesses in the united states that is because taxes on business earnings are often paid through the individual income tax when passed through to business owners the business income from sole proprietorships farm proprietorships partnerships s corporations etc is all taxed at the owners individual income tax rates this year 34 million business owners are expected to receive this type of income and pay tax on this income through the individual income tax these businesses are typically small and often entrepreneurial in nature and a source of innovation and risk taking in the economy moreover these business owners are frequently subject to the highest individual income tax rates
2147232 sen obama wants to raise the long term capital gains rate for families making more than 250 000 to around 20 percent or somewhat higher but not above the 28 percent level it reached during the reagan presidency an obama economic adviser says the same rate would apply to most dividend income for these investors

2147234 what we ought to tax is dirty energy like coal and to a lesser extent natural gas
2147235 and i found this fascinating maria that on the issue of taxes he looked to insulate himself by saying that if in fact economic conditions justify the fact that it might harm the economy he might be willing to hold off some of his tax increases when he takes office in january lets take a listen to barack obama
2147236 some of those you could possibly defer but i think the basic principle of restoring fairness to our economy and encouraging bottom up economic growth is important so heres what we know we know that over the last decade or so that more than half of the economic growth has been captured by the top one percent of u s citizens that means the other 99 percent have seen their effective incomes go down that is not a recipe for long term economic growth
2147237 even though senator obamas plan eliminates individual income taxes for seniors with incomes less than 50 000 his plan would raise taxes for almost 10 million senior households over a third of the total not shown in table on average seniors would face a tax increase of about 2 percent of income

2147267 but why there if cars were just dripping oil the whole lane would be that color the middle of the lane is a bit like that why the darker spots
2147268 in a traffic jam a leaky car stays in the same spot and dumps a lot
2147269 good idea but then it wouldnt be smeared like that would it itd just sit in a puddle with sharp edges
2147270 i think so suppose you have a car with a really small oil leak so a drop of oil is just hanging on the underside somewhere it could come off any time but when theres a low spot in the road it has a greater chance of being bounced off it wont happen at the same place will all the drops because the drops are different and the cars are different but statistically itll be somewhere around there which is why they look smeared

2147316 well i were a mighty rough customer in them days not that i aint still a bit of a rogue mind
2147317 but back then let me tell you i was a right hellion drinking dueling gambling and carousing from sunup to sundown no corsair you can name wouldnta had nothing on me but then one day while sailing the irish sea my superior officer finally called me to carpet on my moonshines
2147318 drunk as a skunk i were when we set out from donnegal bay in ireland and dead senseless to the world when they dropped me poor self off on the leeward side of on a remote windswept isle sos as to teach me a lesson
2147319 they went off to erris head to refit intending to come back for me in a day or two once id been scared good and proper but it was worse than even they intended for there were a wicked glamour about the place few o them knew of
2147320 i suppose in your former profession theyd call it black magic
2147321 she couldnt have much o that girlish beauty anymore if she were there that long
2147322 it mustve kept back all them ravages of age and such
2147323 the lass told me her jailer were away for a time gathering herbs for his potions and how very much obliged shed be should i choose to lower her prison and set her free nothing would be easier says i and id just secured her release from the cage when blimey if that poxy old bugger of a druid dont burst out of the trees and sets to with the spells well the girl of course shes off to parts unknown and that god damn druid begging your pardon sir its just sea lingo you understand anyways that sorcerer bloke incensed attempts his wicked enchantments on me person and i dashing young flash i was in them days would have none of it and promptly spitted him upon me sword like so
2147324 then off i plunges into the woods again with a thank you to my sweet cutlass here
2147325 and then i saw that them trees all around me wasnt of natural proportions for trees but they
2147326 and i pinched me skin and see its gone all brown rough and senseless as old tree bark i wanted to run but found i was held fast me foot stuck in the ground somehow i tried to wrench myself free but now i was stuck up to me ankle in the soil unable to budge thats when i realized id grown roots aye roots tough as little iron anchors stuck down deep in the ground and then then the rest of the change began to take place me soft flesh went all to hard wood heavy and stiff and i sees with sick fascination that awful bark all cunning like making its way creeping up me thigh and i knew that none could help me now id be a perfect poplar by sun up
2147327 aye sir it did for it was then and only then did this poor sinner turn to our lord and pray pray as i done long ago a poor innocent child unschooled in them rotten vices of the world
2147328 and like magic itself them holy words beat back deaths hand and the advance of the druids devilish magic
2147329 and in the darkness i felt the blood return to me veins as the wicked tree sap left them beneath the crust i felt me flesh stir to life once more my false skin of bark crack and fall away like scales from a fish but then i saw some changes was too long set to reverse me foot which had went to root in the earth itd gone to sap and timber all the way through and damn me if it didnt remain that way good as any tree and though i prayed again i come to figure that the lord above blessed cove what he is he left me this as a reminder and punishment of me wicked ways and i trust itll stay stubborn wood till im old and gray
2147330 i tell you though i plod gods green earth on this bit o timber the rest of me days i praise providence for his mercy what chose to save me from such a fate as befell them other men
2147331 them what is to this very day still dropping leaves in that cursed forest over the moldering bones of their godless master
2147332 twas a time and place quite far from these sunny shores and i thank ye reverend for bendin an ear to this poor old sailors tale bless your soul
2147333 for your good works reverend should you ever wishes to continue your ministrations to the heathen abroad may they never be interrupted again by lack of funds

2147704 unfortunately the gains for imagination are not free the protections for imagination are indiscriminate they shield bad ideas as well as good ones and there are many more of the former than the latter most fantasies lead us astray and most of the consequences of imagination for individuals and individual organizations are disastrous most deviants end up on the scrap pile of failed mutations not as heroes of organizational transformation there is as a result much that can be viewed as unjust in a system that induces imagination among individuals and individual organizations in order to allow a larger system to choose among alternative experiments by glorifying imagination we entice the innocent into unwitting self destruction or if you prefer altruism
2147705 hello fellow clubpenguin players i am fishy fishr the server i go on is north pole
2147706 o people of the book come to common terms as between us and you that we worship none but allah that we associate no partners with him that we erect not from among ourselves lords and patrons other than allah
2147707 bear witness that we at least are muslims bowing to allah s will
2147708 the prophet which prophesieth of peace when the word of the prophet shall come to pass then shall the prophet be known that the lord hath truly sent him
2147709 suppose ye that i am come to give peace on earth
2147710 allah created all the nations and tribes that they may recognize each other not that they may despise each other
2147711 therefore say i unto you the kingdom of god shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof
2147712 everything mentioned above fits perfectly to islam and prophet muhammed pbuh one does not have to stretch ones imagination the truth is clear as daylight
2147713 verily the first house of worship appointed for mankind was that in bakka makkah full of blessing and guidance for all people
2147714 arise shine for thy light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee o thou muhammed wrapped up in garments arise and warn and your lord magnify for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee the advent of prophet muhammed pbuh was at a time of spiritual darkness when the world forgot the oneness of god as taught by abraham and all the other prophets including jesus pbut and the gentiles shall come to thy light and kings to the brightness of thy rising
2147715 because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee the forces of the gentiles shall come unto thee

2147720 the mighty men of the children of kedar shall be diminished for the lord god of israel hath spoken it
2147721 of the ishmaelite tribes kedar must have been one of the most important and thus in later times the name came to be applied to all the wild tribes of the desert
2147722 it is through kedar arab keidar that muslim genealogists trace the descent of muhammed from ishmael
2147723 words were out into the prophets mouth thereafter the prophet read it out to his companions and a scribe used to write it down after it was written down it was read to the prophet for verification
2147724 and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name i will require it of him
2147725 in the name of allah most gracious and most merciful
2147726 in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit
2147727 this corresponds with passages in the holy quran truly the religion in the sight of allah is islam
2147728 behold my servant whom i uphold mine elect in whom my soul delighteth i have put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth judgment to the gentiles
2147729 i bear witness that there is no deity except allah who has no partner and i bear witness that muhammed is his servant and messenger
2147730 he shall not cry nor lift up nor cause his voice to be heard in the street
2147731 he shall not fail nor be discouraged till he has set judgment in the earth and the isles shall wait for his law
2147732 i the lord have called thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the gentiles
2147733 to open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house

2147737 here i am for your service o allah here i am you have no partner here i am verily yours is the praise the blessings and sovereignty there is no god besides you
2147738 let them give glory unto the lord and declare his praise in the islands

2147740 his mouth is most sweet yea he is muhummed im altogether lovely this is my beloved and this is my friend o daughters of jerusalem
2147741 i john the baptist indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire
2147742 verily i say unto you among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater one than john the baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he
2147743 blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god
2147744 think not that i am come to send peace on earth i came not to send peace but a sword for i am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter in law against her mother in law and kingdom of heaven means the establishing of islam on earth which is the name given by allah for his religion the quran states in the final precept bit of revelation at the time of the farewell pilgrimage of the prophet
2147745 o children of israel i am the apostle of allah sent to you confirming the torah which came before me and giving glad tidings of an apostle to come after me whose name shall be ahmed i e another name of prophet muhammed and literally means the one who praises allah more than any other
2147746 and will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto them all that i shall command him
2147747 your companion muhammed is neither astray nor being misled nor does he speak of his own desire it is only the inspiration that is inspired
2147748 and that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death
2147749 give not that which is holy unto the dogs neither cast ye your pearls before swine
2147750 jesus saith unto her mary woman what have i to do with thee

2147924 kalau dilihat dari angka memang masih tinggi tapi untuk menekan itu semua kami sudah melakukan langkah langkah dengan membuat 4 langkah strategis
2147925 untuk pendekatan blok kita akan mencari tahu kantong kantong mana saja yang masih tinggi jumlah buta aksaranya dan untuk strategi perintah kami juga mengharapkan bupati atau walikota mengeluarkan instruksi tentang wajar dikdas dan penanganan buta aksara seperti presiden dan gubernur

2147974 if the patient is well enough not to require inpatient hospitalization it is better to have it done as an outpatient and go home
2147975 sometimes an older person wont respond to an antidepressant the depression becomes worse and then it becomes life threatening ect electroconvulsive therapy works quickly
2147976 certainly there is a lot of depression in the elderly but my opinion is that ect electroconvulsive therapy is an easier method than trying medications and it adds a measure of control
2147977 even textbooks written in the 1950s reflected the attitude that the doctor ought not to worry the patient about side effects
2147978 it is a risk benefit analysis generally people accept it because it is much less debilitating than the ongoing depression
2147979 we make it very clear when obtaining consent that there is a risk of patchy loss of memory there is a full recovery of anterograde memory the ability to form new memories if there wasnt this procedure would never have lasted
2147980 i suffer from permanent memory loss and have trouble learning new things
2147981 when there is brain damage as there is with a stroke there are chemicals that can be found in the blood theyve been measured following electroconvulsive therapy and theyre not there
2147982 the use of sine wave stimulation and the bilateral electrode placement were both associated with greater short and long term deficits
2147983 there appears to be little justification for the continued first line use of bl ect bilateral electroconvulsive therapy in the treatment of major depression
2147984 thus adverse cognitive effects were detected six months following the acute treatment course
2147985 this study provides the first evidence in a large prospective sample that adverse cognitive effects can persist for an extended period and that they characterize routine treatment with ect in community settings
2147986 critics contend that ect invariably results in substantial and permanent memory loss

2147995 a democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government it can only exist until the voters discover they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury from that moment on the majority always votes for the candidates promising them the most benefits from the treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal responsibility always followed by a dictatorship the average of the worlds great civilizations before they decline has been 200 years nations have progressed in this sequence from bondage to spiritual faith from spiritual faith to great courage from courage to liberty from liberty to abundance from abundance to selfishness from selfishness to complacency from complacency to apathy from apathy to dependency from dependency back again to bondage

2148004 a former software researcher at the xerox research center is preaching the gospel of linux hes convinced that the free software model is the only way for africa to ever leapfrog its status as an underdeveloped continent
2148005 the explosive politics of proprietary versus free open source software in africa even with its few computers this debate is now boiling down to a clash between microsoft windows msft and linux os
2148006 the reason why linux has not caught up so fast is because most big companies operate on group wide it platforms built on microsoft nt 1
2148007 businesses are also growing curious about using linux in kenya with giants such as kenya airways and kenya power amp lighting already evaluating its merits

2148057 rosenblatts poetry and drawings are full of natural things ants beetles dragonflies birds bees pigs cats frogs fish lampreys trees horses caterpillars and serpents among other things including humans and some metamorphosed unnatural things a surprising number of these natural things are linked traditionally to mythology and folklore with fecundity in the mosaic myth god blessed them saying be fruitful and multiply genesis1 22

2148108 there is only a modest connection between wealth and happiness the rich dont have a monopoly on happiness in fact people who focus on the accumulation of wealth are more likely to be unhappy in the australian context this is supported by a study why australians will never be prosperous released last july the study found 21 per cent of surveyed individuals in the lowest income group up to 25 000 indicated that they were totally satisfied with life whereas only 13 per cent of individuals in the highest income group 100 001 plus stated that they were totally satisfied
2148109 so if money doesnt do the trick what should we be aspiring to the things that are conducive to happiness are fit and healthy bodies realistic goals self esteem optimism an outgoing personality a sense of control close relationships challenging work and active leisure punctuated by adequate rest and a faith that entails communal support purpose and acceptance

2148289 i have been involved in doing yoga meditation and other types of energy exercises for some years but i was a little skeptical of reiki at first howver i found that in getting the first two attunements from hilary she was very pleasant and knowledgable i felt very comfortable in working with her and liked her laid back approach she did a nice job of giving me the attunements and i have definitely felt the benefit of doing the exercises on myself since as well as some of the long distance healing techniques on some family and friends
2148290 i consulted hilary in early february 2008 for knee pain from a recent injury
2148291 hilary is a master pun intended at all things reiki during my first experience she made me feel very comfortable relaxed and at peace her enthusiasm and extensive knowledge definitely qualify her as an expert teacher and healer even if you are only experimenting with different methods of alternative health and youre not a total believer you should check her out shes comfortable with an open mind and is probably the best person to see if you are newer to reiki
2148292 hilary kirsten is an experienced hypnotherapist that assisted me in seeking out information about past lives i was able to transcend into the astral plane and see alternative lives past and future the experience was interesting and i plan to do a few more sessions with hilary
2148293 hilarys hypnotics work like a charm its done wonders for me i recommend it to anyone and everyone i feel great after being hypnotized
2148294 good news i have definitely seen and felt a difference in myself and much less fear of going door to door the last few times i went out i was much more relaxed and at ease and i havent wanted to eat many late night snacks after dinner like before so far i feel really good and definitely see a difference already thank you so much for your help
2148295 im a spiritual counselor and healer and ive had the opportunity to work with alternative health care practitioners of all flavors hilary is by far my hypnotherapist of choice shes worked with me with hypnosis on a number of goals and each time never fails to achieve what we set out to do i have complete confidence in her and refer my own clients to her regularly i can never rave enough about how wonderful she is at what she does

2148375 now that you have melvin use him always he may not look like much but he is a precious heirloom of this family

2148379 without proper supervision adults should never be allowed to use swords knives or a brace of pistols
2148380 youll do fine youre a silver dueling is in your blood now dont look so incredulous at me little jane its true you know george silver was the first britisher to publish a thorough analysis on the strengths and weakness of the various continental fencing styles
2148381 you see learning the sword is like learning to talk words comprend you learn the words and what they mean and then how to put them together now you can still be understood if you dont know all the words and exactly how they fit in a sentence but you wont be considered well spoken until you master the technique of proper speech fencing is the same you must learn the proper movements and stances and what each one does and how to string them together
2148382 couldnt i just learn to brawl like all them other fellows around here i mean no offense but it does seem that fine speech and courtly swordplay might serve no point here i doubt any o them
2148383 your special trick that only you know unique to you that surprise you give your opponent when all seems lost
2148384 and does everyone aboard have a modis a gimmick your mother for example she uses an extremely light sword but with a very sharp tip her footwork is extremely fast when she comes at you its like a needle in and out and side to side and every stroke she makes even if theres not a mans physical strength behind it with such a thin sharp blade every thrust is deadly precise exact do you see
2148385 she bobs around you quick as a fox and the moment you leave even the tiniest part of yourself undefended to her attack ccccchhhhh
2148386 what about me father then dont see him lollygagging around studying them lessons wasting time practicing
2148387 just because youve never seen him at it doesnt mean i dont instruct him privately
2148388 just not terribly graceful and hes rather vain about such things you see
2148389 well hes crack with a pistol no question excellent aim and a speedy loader too with the blade hes got a nice supple wrist good strength to his lunge i suppose but above all that id wager your fathers tongue against even george silvers sword any day
2148390 nothing but who said the art of the sword was about bravery and noblity certainly not i all its about little jane is trying not to get yourself killed all the rest is just window dressing as i understand it all the fancy techniques in the world wont help you if youve got a fencing foil stuck through your bum but then again i may just be old fashioned
2148391 tall broad in the shoulders a man like that can intimidate a fellow just by standing still some people make the mistake of assuming all big men are slow but its not true old ned for example is quick as lightning a proper jack tar he is tough as they come
2148392 oh i wouldnt say that hed work for anyone for a bit of coin thats one vulnerability thats it aint there anything more to it
2148393 a wise man once told me imagination is the root of all kindness
2148394 but youre a weaponsmaster doing people harm is what you do
2148395 which is why i choose to exercise my imagination as infrequently as possible
2148396 maybe the workshop that first made the sword who knows

2148499 we are disappointed with guidance and dont expect investors to have confidence in managements investment decisions

2148508 the giants shocker over the patriots will go down in super bowl history as one of the most discussed contests ever

2148887 you might be good at what you do you might have diligently trained for years or been born with natural aptitude and inspirational talent
2148888 regardless of how much ability you think you have or how little you actually do there is one thing that is for damn sure theres no way youve got enough scars to be the best the best aint pretty little elfy fucks like you lot
2148889 the sad truth is that real criminal learning only happens on the smash youve got to be out there and if youre lucky still have enough blood in you to be conscious in order to learn anything and of course most folks of your high caliber arent exactly favored by chance or they wouldnt be in this particular position

2148895 ill paint you a picture your commjockey minus support is pinned offsite behind a van by viper snipers on the other side of your entrance line your planned breach point is blocked by a pissant grade two amish mag on a mormon girl security door and youre left swinging naked in a shitstorm if you potshot the snipers who are well out of your weapons accurate range youll draw their fire and you have no cover other than the lummox in body armor next to you that cant open the same mag even an infant with downs could what the hell is downs bet you wish you had fit the popping of a few cheap maglocks into your tight schedule of popping ass cherries eh
2148896 one of two things will happen after your friends kick some sense into you during your inevitable panic attack youre gonna try and fail to supress the snipers while your hackboy completely disregarding reason
2148897 makes a suicide dash for your position or your hackboy is gonna find his lost shred of intelligence in the pocket of the pants he just pissed yeah the shred you thought he didnt have and refuse to get himself killed unless you have a coolersuit a silence word a rifle that you can perform neurosurgey with and your boyscout marksmanship badge youre not gonna be able to remedy his righteous fear of dying in a noxious pool of his own piss shit and blood

2148933 i have been meeting chinese leaders for 7 1 2 years and my message has been the same you should not fear religious people in your society

2148936 but its also an opportunity to say to the chinese people we respect your traditions we respect your history

2148954 people saw the target much more often if it appeared in the middle of a vertical line of similar looking grey rectangles compared to when it appeared in the middle of a pattern of bright white rectangles they even registered seeing the target when it wasnt actually there
2148955 this is because people are mentally better prepared to see something vague when the surrounding context is also vague it made sense for them to see it so thats what happened when the target didnt match the expectations set by the surrounding context they saw it much less often
2148956 when you see them throw a ball into the air followed by a second ball and then a third ball which magically disappears you wonder how they did it
2148957 contrary to what one might expect it is a vague rather than a bright and clearly visible context that most strongly permits our beliefs to override the evidence and fill in the blanks
2148958 mathematical modelling suggests that visual inference through context is processed in the brain beyond the primary visual cortex by starting with a relatively simple experiment such as this where visual input can be more easily and systematically manipulated we are gaining a better understanding of how context influences what we see further studies along these lines can hopefully enable us to dissect the workings behind more complex and wondrous illusions

2148969 the most merciful thing that the large family does to one of its infant members is to kill it
2148970 the care of children is infinitely better left to the best trained practitioners of both sexes who have chosen it as a vocation this would further undermine family structure while contributing to the freedom of women
2148971 in a patriarchal society all heterosexual intercourse is rape because women as a group are not strong enough to give meaningful consent
2148972 our culture including all that we are taught in schools and universities is so infused with patriarchal thinking that it must be torn up root and branch if genuine change is to occur everything must go even the allegedly universal disciplines of logic mathematics and science and the intellectual values of objectivity clarity and precision on which the former depend
2148973 heterosexuality is a die hard custom through which male supremacist institutions insure their own perpetuity and control over us women are kept maintained and contained through terror and violence lesbianism is an ideological political and philosophical means of liberation of all women from heterosexual tyranny

2148975 marriage has existed for the benefit of men and has been a legally sanctioned method of control over women we must work to destroy it the end of the institution of marriage is a necessary condition for the liberation of women therefore it is important for us to encourage women to leave their husbands and not to live individually with men all of history must be rewritten in terms of oppression of women we must go back to ancient female religions like witchcraft

2149062 barangsiapa yang tidur dalam keadaan suci maka malaikat akan bersamanya di dalam pakaiannya dia tidak akan bangun hingga malaikat berdoa ya allah ampunilah hambamu si fulan karena tidur dalam keadaan suci

2149140 all have sinned and come short of the glory of god
2149141 if only we didnt have so many guys on i r we might have won that game
2149142 it was designed to not have a single un obstructed seat in the whole place generally its easy to get in and out of the aisles and easy to get around the dodgers still have an organist nancy bea hefley and they do two rounds of take me out to the ball game if you give yourself enough time to get there it is one of the most relaxing sporting events just drive up get out of your car and take in one of the most spectacular baseball settings in the country
2149143 give yourself the same amount of time youd take going to work in la what you hope for plus 1 hour and youll be at
2149144 the best way to get there is by car which makes sense given los angeles is a drive your own car town however the truth of the matter is that the expansive parking lots surrounding dodger stadium are part of the master plan of dodger owner frank mccourt to bilk fans 15 per visit parking was 8 per car when he bought the team preferred parking monopolizes the interior loop leaving day of game fans to walk 10 minutes just to get to the gates bring comfortable shoes the trek is worth it but i have to think that there are hundreds of middle class families particularly those with small kids who cant afford the trek and or the parking toll and forgo a visit altogether
2149145 as of the all star break the city of la is sponsoring a free shuttle from union station where many commuter trains come together right in downtown itll continue depending on ridership so tell your friends please
2149146 people who arent from la love to complain about dodger stadium you cant really take public transportation to get there parking is a nightmare dodger stadium isnt near downtown so there arent any good bars across the street blah blah blah these are all valid complaints from any other city but lets be clear real los angelenos never complain about any of these things
2149147 before the game the hopping place in town is the birthplace of the french dip sandwich and a los angeles institution here a diverse group of fans feast on juicy sandwiches coleslaw and potato salad in an unpretentious environment welcoming of dodger fans of all types they serve 10 cent cups of coffee along with 80 bottles of silver oak cabernet but save room for the dodger dogs of course
2149148 tailgating isnt allowed at dodger stadium city statute not dodger policy so philippes is your best bet if youre normally a tailgating type
2149149 if youre lucky enough to be on field level you can experience the new wider concourses which are indeed nice and a good range of dining establishments like another la institution which brought its pastrami sandwiches and other treats to the stadium just this year upper level tiers dont have the same breadth of options so it pays to get there early before the ushers segregate people to their respective levels
2149150 its a must to buy a bag of peanuts from
2149151 you should know that dodger dogs are not big plump all beef frankfurters theyre a different kind of dog a mostly pork extra long wiener thats always been made by an la based meat purveyor even if youre not a fan of these type of hot dogs you have to appreciate the fact that dodger stadium has used the exact same hot dogs since the place opened and that the dodgers support local business
2149152 of course one has to eat a dodger dog grilled if at all possible they are the perfect blend of salty wiener and sweet white bread and go well with tons of mustard and onions you gotta eat your vegetables one thing that i believe is unique to california ballparks statewide is that they dont serve beer at your seat meaning that youve got to get up from your seat and stand in a line to fetch your own 12 large cup of bud light which is also wrong in so many ways
2149153 there are lots of concession stands that sell dodger dogs in the stadium
2149154 im a fan of camachos nachos as opposed to most nachos that are just cheese dip and pre packaged chips these are loaded and a meal the carnation chocolate malts used to be something but now theyre whipped and far from as rich as they used to be and for gods sake dont buy a cpk pizza from the guys going up and down the aisles garlic fries should only be eaten by giants fans
2149155 if you want to be among the stars and the sons and daughters of upper class los angeles suburbia sit on the lower level near the dodger dugout field seats used to be 12 back in 1992 now theyre 130 on game day groan
2149156 dodger stadium was pretty avant garde in that its sightlines have held up despite its relatively old age almost every seat is a pretty good view but field level between the base paths cant be so close to the action that you feel like youre right in the game on a warm summer night in los angeles underneath the stars and beneath the think blue sign on the hill over center field there really is no nicer place to spend an evening
2149157 maybe its because this is where i started sitting as a kid but reserved level third base side great price great view of the park dodger vision the scoreboard and the mountains if its a day game the shade will come to you
2149158 one place not to sit is the baseline club boxes which have been redone twice in their short existence due to crappy sightlines the mccourts original attempt to fill dodger stadiums expansive foul territory with seats had to be completely destroyed as people were looking straight into the backs of other fans heads now that theyve added tables and made boxed seating its a little better but still not worth the premium
2149159 the right field pavilion features all you can eat food for a fixed price but its a poor place to watch a ballgame and is only fun if youre really in the mood to gorge yourself on hot dogs and nachos
2149160 for such a big stadium there arent too many bad seats i would avoid reserve and loge where the seats start to curve sections 47 amp 161 and higher the top deck isnt so bad but you are restricted to just that area so dont expect to sneak down to great seats in the sixth inning for you big spenders dodger stadium also has many different options for premium seating the suites are said to be the nicest in baseball and they also have baseline seats where you have tables at your seat to eat your buffet food at a relatively cheap price
2149161 i usually advise people to sit in the infield reserve section the reserve level is the largest tier of the seating bowl and if you sit in the cheaper reserve seats you could find yourself pretty far away from the action but the infield reserve seats are those few rows right behind home plate and they offer a great view of the game if you can get a ticket in one of the first few rows youre essentially sitting directly above the press box if youre a baseball fan these are the seats that let you really see everything and they can be had for less than thirty bucks 28 face but you can frequently buy them cheaper if you take advantage of all the ticket promotions the dodgers offer
2149162 if youre going to a night game and you arent frightened by steep stairs i recommend sitting on the top level of dodger stadium first of all looking away from home plate you can have an extraordinary view of los angeles with city hall all of downtown and well depending on smog i have seen reflections off the ocean way out there near sunset it can warm your soul about as much as any man made vista can it is also worth the elevator ride to the top to see it if you sit further down and i must admit that the press box seats are excellent
2149163 theres history here its a niche carved out of suburban sprawl with a view of the mountains on one side and a beautiful view of the skyline to the back as you leave the stadium its a retreat from the actual city but right in the heart
2149164 hard core dodger fans bring transistor radios to the game theres a good reason most radio announcers describe the game for people who cant be there in person vin scully is so good that he makes the game way better even for people who are already there vin scully is the heart and soul of the hes been calling dodger games since the team was in brooklyn hes been the dodger announcer for my dads entire life for my entire life and one day god willing for my children if youre lucky to be at a game where they honor vinny be prepared for a 10 minute ovation and an embarrassed vin hes famous for his humility
2149165 dodger stadium is special because its nestled in the mountains that overlook the los angeles basin because of that location we get the best sunsets in baseball and we get to look out on rolling hills and palm trees beyond the outfield walls sure parking for 15 is a drag but this is a city where you pay to park at the mall
2149166 ive been to over 35 major league stadiums including 25 current mlb parks and the reason why i love dodger stadium enough to visit 20 times a year is that the diversity of the crowd reflects the wonderful diversity of los angeles like no other venue i havent found another cause that can bring all ages races income levels and backgrounds together like a game at dodger stadium when the dodgers score which to be fair hasnt been that often this year its awesome to see the crowd erupt in harmony all cheering in unison for their favorite team and on a summer evening under a cloudless night sky in los angeles along with 56 000 of your closest friends there is really no better place to be

2149206 my favorite one on one with myself moments are the ones where i am just walking around the city maybe heading back from a meeting or a store always taking a new route to get home those are the moments when i really realize how much i love ny and what a dynamic and one of a kind city it truly is
2149207 i never feel alone in this city but lately i have been studying for my last semester at law school on my fire escape the sweet irony of that is i think it might be illegal to sit on your fire escape

2149240 the presumption has always been that identical twins are identical down to their dna

2149242 more importantly changes in cnv may tell us if a missing gene or multiple copies of a gene are implicated in the onset of disease
2149243 if twin a develops parkinsons and twin b does not the region of their genome where they show differences is a target for further investigation to discover the basic genetic underpinnings of the disease

2149389 jadi nampaknya kita masih mengekalkan fiil dan budaya lama fiil tidak mahu memeriksa kesalahan dan kelemahan kita secara kolektif secara rasional bijak dan cerdik kita mencari kesalahan orang lain kesalahan pengundi kesalahan parti lawan para pemimpin parti walaupun tidak semuanya cuba menutup suara rakyat akar umbi umno tidak mahu mendengar pandangan dan kritikan dan teguran mereka kita pergi ke sana ke mari menyebarkan propaganda dan dongeng bahawa parti akan rosak jikalau ahli akar umbi umno tidak menyerahkan segala masalah yang dihadapi oleh umno sekarang kepada pucuk pimpinan untuk ditangani dengan sebaik baiknya mereka diseru supaya memberikan kepercayaan kepada pucuk pimpinan apakah mereka tidak sedar bahawa yang menjadi punca besar kelemahan umno yang membawa kepada malapetaka yang tersebut itu bukan rakyat akar umbi umno tetapi ialah kelemahan kepimpinan umno ini termasuk para menteri umno yang setengah setengahnya tidak mempunyai rekod peribadi moral dan budaya yang baik merekalah yang tidak mahu umno berubah merekalah yang mahu kepimpinan umno yang ada dikekalkan jangan digantikan jangan ditandingi
2149390 soal perdana menteri dipilih oleh rakyat mengikut pandangan saya yang tidak cerdik itu adalah tidak tepat
2149391 abdullah sebenarnya dipilih oleh ahli umno yang memilih beliau sebagai presiden parti dan mengikut konvensyen sebagai pengerusi bn beliau dipilih sebagai perdana menteri
2149392 usah didebatkan soal ini kerana apapun abdullah datang dari umno dan kepada umno ia kedudukannya harus kembali
2149393 walaupun kerajaan membelanjakan berbilion ringgit jika rakyat tidak membantu maka segala langkah yang diambil tidak akan menjadi dengan keadaan harga beras yang semakin naik dan bekalan yang tidak mencukupi
2149394 rakyat tidak perlu salah faham bukan kita melarang tetapi perlu belajar berjimat cermat mulai sekarang selanjutnya
2149395 saya fikir ada satu perasaan membuak buak di peringkat bawah iaitu perasaan tidak puas hati yang ketara
2149396 oleh itu saya berpendapat kalau tidak berlaku perubahan dalam umno maka banyak perkara tidak baik akan terjadi justeru saya takut jika saya tidak bercakap dengan benar ia akhirnya boleh membawa bencana kepada orang melayu dan umno
2149397 saya perlu bersuara walaupun tidak lantang tetapi tegas dan jelas kerana apabila saya bercakap ini saya tidak melihat membayangkan muka sesiapa sama ada muka pak lah najib muhyiddin atau mat taib atau mana mana pemimpin umno apa yang saya bimbang ialah umno dan orang melayu akan kalah saya benar benar takut kalau saya tidak mengatakan yang hak benar walaupun yang hak itu adalah pahit maka umno boleh terjerumus ke dalam keadaan lebih teruk
2149398 saya rasa jika pelan peralihan kuasa diumumkan pemimpin pemimpin di peringkat akar umbi akan tahu tempoh yang ditetapkan dan ia adalah baik untuk menstabilkan parti peringkat akar umbi sepatutnya dibenar menyatakan apa yang mereka rasa

2149408 in the 1960s a mafia don was only as strong as his family we found the hierarchical culture of organized crime intriguing running an organized crime family in a world defined by family loyalty is something that we felt could introduce a new strategic element to the genre that is what the dons view is all about laying out a strategy to pick off the competition one by one the dons view is so unique it could fundamentally change the rules of open world games by blending action and strategy to create something entirely new

2149590 it is known that there are an infinite number of worlds simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in
2149591 therefore there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds
2149592 lunatics perverts psychotics derelicts retards criminals pedophiles and insane people
2149593 it is known that there are an infinite number of worlds simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them however not every one of them is inhabited therefore there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds any finite number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds so the average population of all the planets in the universe can be said to be zero from this it follows that the population of the whole universe is also zero and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination
2149594 the study illustrates that if early conditions had been just slightly different very unpleasant things could have happened like planets being thrown into the sun or jettisoned into deep space
2149595 the vast majority of other planetary systems didnt have these special properties at birth and became something very different
2149596 we also know that the solar system is special and understand at some level what makes it special

2149622 i used to dream about stuff like this when i was a kid unfortunately when i dreamed about it i was the one hitting the home run
2149623 obviously were both not in major league baseball for different reasons
2149624 thats probably why the moment is not being celebrated in baseball not only because of the steroids people are talking about but because neither of us is playing in major league baseball youd have to go find barry where he is and youd have to go to a minor league city to find me to talk about it
2149625 one of the things i think about is do the nationals not want me there because im popular there because of that
2149626 do they not want me there because hell we dont want to talk about giving up a home run to barry bonds as the only thing worth talking about in nationals history
2149627 hell on 3 2 i threw a curveball a good pitch he hit foul i tried to make a pitch down and away and i didnt and he hit it out i stunk that game i gave up five runs in five innings i didnt have good stuff people can say what they want to say

2149663 on any rational analysis this is a loss for the prosecution note the prosecution asked for at least thirty years and with time served he should finish his sentence in five months now he may not be released then having served his sentence because he remains an enemy combatant which makes one wonder as to the point of the trial the sentence is notional because serving it doesnt lead to release and it certainly isnt a helpful show trial politically perhaps more to the point even if he served the full 66 months now that hardly sounds like a sentence for a serious terrorist the sentence suggests the jurors army officers so not bleeding hearts by any stretch didnt see the case as all that serious a blow for the prosecution for sure

2149779 my father which gave them me is greater than all
2149780 verily verily i say unto you the servant yahshua is not greater than his lord yahweh neither he that is sent yahshua greater than he that sent him yahweh
2149781 doubtless thou art our father though abraham be ignorant of us and israel acknowledge us not thou o yahweh art our father our redeemer thy name is from everlasting
2149782 for unto which of the angels said he at any time thou art my son this day have i begotten thee and again i will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son
2149783 i will declare the decree yahweh hath said unto me thou art my son this day have i begotten thee
2149784 and i will give thee the treasures of darkness and hidden riches of secret places that thou mayest know that i yahweh which call thee by thy name am the elohim of israel
2149785 the elohim of abraham and of isaac and of jacob the elohim of our fathers hath glorified his son yahshua
2149786 then yahweh rained upon sodom and upon gomorrah brimstone and fire from yahweh out of heaven
2149787 thou even thou art yahweh alone thou hast made heaven the heaven of heavens with all their host the earth and all things that are therein the seas and all that is therein and thou preservest them all and the host of heaven worshippeth thee
2149788 that men may know that thou whose name alone is yahweh art the most high over all the earth
2149789 that they may know from the rising of the sun and from the west that there is none beside me i am yahweh and there is none else
2149790 and yahweh shall be king over all the earth in that day shall there be one yahweh and his name one
2149791 behold my servant whom i uphold mine elect in whom my soul delighteth i have put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth judgment to the gentiles
2149792 and he said it is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of jacob and to restore the preserved of israel i will also give thee for a light to the gentiles that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth
2149793 the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against yahweh and against his anointed
2149794 the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against yahweh and against his messiah
2149795 yahweh said unto my lord sit thou at my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool
2149796 yahweh at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath
2149797 yahweh thy elohim will raise up unto thee a prophet yahshua from the midst of thee of thy brethren like unto me unto him yahshua ye shall hearken i yahweh will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren like unto thee and will put my yahwehs words in his yahshuas mouth and he yahshua shall speak unto them all that i yahweh shall command him yahshua and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my yahwehs words which he yahshua shall speak in my yahwehs name i yahweh will require it of him
2149798 for i have not spoken of myself but the father which sent me he gave me a commandment what i should say and what i should speak
2149799 all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and yahweh hath laid on him yahshua the iniquity of us all yet it pleased yahweh to bruise him yahshua he yahweh hath put him yahshua to grief when thou yahweh shalt make his yahshuas soul an offering for sin he yahshua shall see his seed he yahshua shall prolong his days and the pleasure of yahweh shall prosper in his yahshuas hand
2149800 and i yahweh will pour upon the house of david and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn
2149801 and again another scripture saith they shall look on him whom they pierced
2149802 take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the holy spirit hath made you overseers to feed the church of god which he hath purchased with his own blood kjv
2149803 in his yahshuas days judah shall be saved and israel shall dwell safely and this is his yahshuas name whereby he yahshua shall be called yahweh our righteousness
2149804 in those days shall judah be saved and jerusalem shall dwell safely and this is the name wherewith she shall be called yahweh our righteousness
2149805 but though he yahshua had done so many miracles before them yet they believed not on him yahshua that the saying of esaias the prophet might be fulfilled which he isaiah spake lord who hath believed our report
2149806 therefore they could not believe because that esaias said again he yahweh hath blinded their eyes and hardened their heart that they should not see with their eyes nor understand with their heart and be converted and i yahweh should heal them these things said esaias when he isaiah saw his yahwehs glory and spake of him yahweh
2149807 the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness prepare ye the way of yahweh make straight in the desert a highway for our elohim
2149808 as it is written in the book of the words of isaiah the prophet saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of yahweh make his paths straight every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be brought low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough ways shall be made smooth and all flesh shall see the salvation of yahweh
2149809 yahshua saith unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work
2149810 and elohim said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth
2149811 the letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me
2149812 it is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true i am one that bear witness of myself and the father that sent me beareth witness of me
2149813 perhaps from earliest times but certainly from later the word echad one was understood also to mean unique god is not only one and not many but he is totally other than what paganism means by gods
2149814 he is one because there is no other elohim than he but he is also one because he is wholly unlike anything else in existence he is therefore not only one but the sole and unique elohim
2149815 you are right in saying that yahweh is one and there is no other but him
2149816 and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one
2149817 for i will pass through the land of egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt both man and beast and against all the gods elohim of egypt i will execute judgment i am yahweh
2149818 go enquire of baal zebub the god elohim of ekron whether i shall recover of this disease
2149819 i have said ye are gods elohim and all of you are children of the most high
2149820 and this is life eternal that they might know thee yahweh the only true elohim and yahshua messiah whom thou hast sent
2149821 but to us there is but one elohim the father yahweh of whom are all things and we in him and one master yahshua messiah by whom are all things and we by him
2149822 and we know that the son of god is come and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son jesus christ this is the true god and eternal life
2149823 him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my elohim and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my elohim yahweh and the name of the city of my elohim new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my elohim and i will write upon him my new name
2149824 yahweh said unto my lord sit thou at my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool
2149825 and he yahshua shall stand and feed in the strength of yahweh in the majesty of the name of yahweh his elohim and they shall abide for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth
2149826 yahshua saith unto him have i been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me philip he that hath seen me hath seen the father and how sayest thou then shew us the father
2149827 renewed in knowledge after the image of him yahweh that created him
2149828 but thou bethlehem ephratah though thou be little among the thousands of judah yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in israel whose goings forth have been from of old from everlasting
2149829 i have lift up mine hand unto yahweh the most high god the possessor of heaven and earth
2149830 but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins then saith he to the sick of the palsy arise take up thy bed and go unto thine house and he arose and departed to his house but when the multitudes saw it they marveled and glorified yahweh which had given such power unto men
2149831 i do nothing of myself but as my father hath taught me i speak these things
2149832 the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works
2149833 behold i send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which i have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him
2149834 only the death of god could atone for mans sins the death of a man wouldnt suffice
2149835 and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission of sins
2149836 but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels which are in heaven neither the son but my father
2149837 i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending saith the lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty
2149838 which is and which was and which is to come
2149839 and i saw no temple therein for yahweh elohim almighty and the lamb are the temple of it
2149840 but ye denied the holy one and the just and desired a murderer to be granted unto you
2149841 for i am yahweh thy elohim the holy one of israel thy saviour
2149842 saying let us alone what have we to do with thee thou yahshua of nazareth art thou come to destroy us i know thee who thou art the holy one of yahweh
2149843 for thou wilt not leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption
2149844 i even i am yahweh and beside me there is no saviour
2149845 for they shall cry unto yahweh because of the oppressors and he shall send them a saviour and a great one and he shall deliver them
2149846 thus saith yahweh to his anointed to cyrus whose right hand i have holden to subdue nations before him
2149847 how yahweh anointed yahshua of nazareth with the holy spirit and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for yahweh el was with him
2149848 for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace
2149849 and being made perfect he became the author or father of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him
2149850 and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was messiah
2149851 behold i will stand before thee there upon the rock in horeb and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink and moses did so in the sight of the elders of israel
2149852 searching what or what manner of time the spirit of messiah which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of messiah and the glory that should follow
2149853 and elohim said unto moses i am that i am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am hath sent me unto you and elohim said moreover unto moses thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel yahweh elohim of your fathers the elohim of abraham the elohim of isaac and the elohim of jacob hath sent me unto you this is my name for ever and this is my memorial unto all generations
2149854 i will declare the decree yahweh hath said unto me thou art my son this day have i begotten thee
2149855 and god spoke to moses saying i am the being and he said thus shall ye say to the children of israel the being has sent me to you
2149856 and god said unto moses i am that i am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am hath sent me unto you
2149857 i am ego eimi the bread which came down from heaven
2149858 if a man keep my saying he shall never see death
2149859 these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth
2149860 before abraham comes into being at his resurrection unto eternal life i will
2149861 this is put when the design is to show that some thing will certainly come to pass and is spoken of as though it were already present
2149862 therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is shall be hewn down
2149863 for he taught his disciples and said unto them the son of man is shall be delivered into the hands of men and they shall kill him and after that he is killed he shall rise the third day
2149864 it has time relations only in the indicative where it is past and hence augmented
2149865 the aorist infinitive denotes that which is eventual or particular
2149866 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not any thing made that was made
2149867 see now that i even i am he and there is no god with me i kill and i make alive i wound and i heal neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand
2149868 and the word was with god and the word was god
2149869 all things were made through it and without it was not anything made that was made
2149870 by the word of yahweh were the heavens made and all the host by the breath of his mouth for he spoke and it was he commanded and it stood fast
2149871 in the beginning was the word and the word was with yahweh and the word was yahwehs
2149872 and rachel said with great elohim wrestlings have i wrestled with my sister and i have prevailed and she called his name naphtali
2149873 and there was trembling in the host in the field and among all the people the garrison and the spoilers they also trembled and the earth quaked so it was a very great elohim trembling
2149874 thus saith yahweh thy redeemer and he that formed thee from the womb i am yahweh that maketh all things that stretcheth forth the heavens alone that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself
2149875 which alone spreadeth out the heavens and treadeth upon the waves of the sea
2149876 who hath ascended up into heaven who hath gathered the wind in his fists who hath bound the waters in a garment who hath established all the ends of the earth what is his name and what is his sons name if thou canst tell
2149877 and he said unto them the sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath
2149878 who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you
2149879 for in him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created on account of him and for him
2149880 thou art my son this day i yahweh have begotten thee
2149881 and let all the angels of god yahweh worship him
2149882 thy throne o elohim therefore elohim thy elohim yahweh hath anointed thee
2149883 sit on my right hand until i yahweh make thine enemies thy footstool
2149884 but why dost thou judge thy brother or why dost thou set at nought thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ for it is written as i live saith the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to god
2149885 and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed
2149886 the stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner this is yahwehs doing it is marvelous in our eyes
2149887 thus saith yahweh in this thou shalt know that i am yahweh behold i will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river and they shall be turned to blood and the fish that is in the river shall die and the river shall stink and the egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river and yahweh spake unto moses say unto aaron take thy rod and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of egypt upon their streams upon their rivers and upon their ponds and upon all their pools of water that they may become blood and that there may be blood throughout all the land of egypt both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone and moses and aaron did so as yahweh commanded and he lifted up the rod and smote the waters that were in the river in the sight of pharaoh and in the sight of his servants and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood
2149888 and his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of olives which is before jerusalem on the east and the mount of olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west and there shall be a very great valley and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north and half of it toward the south
2149889 behold the sovereign yahweh will come with strong hand and his arm shall rule for him behold his reward is with him and his work before him
2149890 for behold yahweh will come with fire and with his chariots like a whirlwind to render his anger with fury and his rebuke with flames of fire
2149891 and yahweh said unto me cast it unto the potter a goodly price that i was prised at of them and i took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them to the potter in the house of yahweh
2149892 and he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple
2149893 but and if ye suffer for righteousness sake happy are ye and be not afraid of their terror neither be troubled but sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear
2149894 if so be ye have tasted that the lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of god and precious
2149895 and the father himself which hath sent me hath borne witness of me ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape
2149896 no man hath seen god at any time if we love one another god dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us
2149897 and the angel of yahweh called unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham and he said here am i and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou any thing unto him for now i know that thou fearest elohim seeing thou hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me
2149898 and the angel of yahweh appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and when yahweh saw that he turned aside to see elohim called unto him out of the midst of the bush he said i am the elohim of thy father the elohim of abraham the elohim of isaac and the elohim of jacob and moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon elohim
2149899 behold i send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which i have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that i speak then i will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries
2149900 this is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount sinai and with our fathers who received the lively oracles to give unto us who have received the law by the disposition of angels and have not kept it
2149901 and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator moses
2149902 behold i will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me
2149903 the main point of the jewish law of agency is expressed in the dictum
2149904 whosoever shall confess that yahshua is the son of yahweh yahweh dwelleth in him and he in yahweh
2149905 thou art the messiah the son of the living elohim
2149906 now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy to the only wise god our saviour be glory and majesty dominion and power both now and ever amen
2149907 now unto the king eternal immortal invisible the only wise god be honour and glory for ever and ever amen

2149989 i think being a leader youve got to not be afraid to call people out not be afraid to ruffle some feathers
2149990 a good leader isnt somebody whom everybody likes but somebody everyone respects everybody does like rowand because hes got a good personality and he will talk to you but hes not a guy whos going to beat around the bush if he doesnt like something hes going to speak his mind
2149991 what makes him a leader is whatever he says whatever he puts out there he backs up
2149992 hes in his office doing his stuff on every club you need guys to take on that role because were the ones spending the majority of the time with each other its not the managers job to baby sit
2149993 its up to the older guys on the team to help the younger guys out to mentor to police to be the guys who are responsible for bringing everyone together for one common goal to win ballgames together as a unit
2149994 it was his clubhouse but he didnt want that role he wanted the title he wanted it to be his clubhouse but he didnt want to do the team building stuff so we kind of worked around that we didnt have one leader
2149995 id be lying to you if i didnt say at times that can be difficult
2149996 because when youre not getting the results you want its real easy to not be as exuberant or as vocal as you probably want to be
2149997 i wouldnt do or say anything that i wouldnt do to myself
2149998 im not better than anybody else in this clubhouse i dont think anybody else puts himself on a pedestal were all equals
2149999 we had some guys on there who were very quiet like mays and mccovey but when they spoke you listened we didnt have a cheerleader as such but when these two guys would speak and say you guys need to be quiet or you guys need to speak up thats exactly what we did they would lead by example they would lead by what they were supposed to do on the field
