1090019 search engines should protect users from deceptive ads but if they wont we will

1090070 during the season we spent more time together than we did with our families and our lives
1090071 i have been on campus less than 24 hours i am living in springfield
1090072 i just started playing linebacker last year i was a safety in high school so playing linebacker is new to me
1090073 i love to hit i am trying to develop my game i want to be a defensive version of payton manning i want to study film and to be a student of the game
1090074 oregon has a great program my academic advisor at my jc james rose was a defensive lineman at oregon i really respect him he is a great person he certainly had an impact on me going there
1090075 i played two years of high school football then i took a year off and went to an alternative school at that point i came back and played my senior year i was a full four year college qualifier but i decided to go to junior college at that point coach lenny rodriguez moved me from safety where i played in high school to linebacker that was the position that i was recruited for college
1090076 i had colorado oklahoma state and oregon recruiting me i got two written offers from oregon and oklahoma state
1090077 i feel that colorado wasnt forthcoming in offering me a scholarship because they knew i wanted to go there they finally offered but i felt slighted by them but i am happy with the way things turned out
1090078 oregon has beautiful facilities i got to see them on tv some but i was playing games myself when they were playing most of the time the people in front of me on the team look good but i plan on competing for a playing time immediately i dont think the coaching staff brought me in to sit on the bench i dont think they would bother redshirting me if they do it would be costing them a lot of money
1090079 i love to hit i was coached by coach rodriguez who coached brian urlacher and antonio pierce he honestly helped me i like to play sideline to sideline and hit hard my pass coverage is solid also my teammates and i plan on being in the welcoming committee for jake locker of washington on opening day i intend to have a surprise for him i have really been hearing how big a rivalry washington is
1090080 my pass coverage could get better i need to be able to get into zone coverage better i was drifting in coverage a bit and i would find myself out of place oregon is different from junior college and i am preparing for it
1090081 i see myself as an nfl player that is my dream im preparing myself for that i do want to get my degree in physical education to fall back on though i will go where the money goes
1090082 i have been getting a 2 9 gpa i got an 18 on the act i have been working hard on getting extra credits for school i gave up going to a lot of places so i could concentrate on school i have given up things to get ready
1090083 i want to tell the oregon fans that i am here for a reason i am here to be successful this is where i want to play im easy to get along with im level headed im kind of a jokester like shaq oneal

1090085 we did not have the experience in website development database management and all of that web world type stuff
1090086 in the business of exploiting other peoples licenses with bad quality games
1090087 i think what redeems our industry is quality and i think we take a step back every time we take a license and exploit it with a crappy game thats not what were about
1090088 weve been there most of our competitors are there or have been there thats not what we do were not really after that market
1090089 a lot of the intellectual property we create are better than the license

1090126 to the extent that we aim at making the tax distributively fair we will make it ineffective
1090127 first if people really are so stupid that they are unable to recognize basic self interest or so immoral that they cannot act rightly then probably we should not allow them to vote
1090128 but i can look at you while youre burning in the fire and not be required to help
1090129 to illustrate this on the altruists favorite example the issue of saving a drowning person if the person to be saved is a stranger it is morally proper to save him only when the danger to ones own life is minimal when the danger is great it would be immoral to attempt it only a lack of self esteem could permit one to value ones life no higher than that of any random stranger and conversely if one is drowning one cannot expect a stranger to risk his life for ones sake remembering that ones life cannot be as valuable to him as his own what then should one properly grant to strangers the generalized respect and good will which one should grant to a human being in the name of the potential value he represents until and unless he forfeits it it is on the ground of that generalized good will and respect for the value of human life that one helps strangers in an emergency and only in an emergency

1090140 ive never seen a woman come out of her first pregnancy as good looking as she went in
1090141 while providing financially for children is challenging it pales in comparison to the emotional and behavioral challenges of raising kids this leads to the conclusion that if youre avoiding pregnancy because of financial considerations youre probably a shallow asshole who shouldnt be having kids anyway
1090142 this right of privacy whether it be founded in the fourteenth amendments concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action as we feel it is or as the district court determined in the ninth amendments reservation of rights to the people is broad enough to encompass a womans decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy the detriment that the state would impose upon the pregnant woman by denying this choice altogether is apparent 1 specific and direct harm medically diagnosable even in early pregnancy may be involved 2 maternity or additional offspring may force upon the woman a distressful life and future 3 psychological harm may be imminent mental and physical health may be taxed by child care 4 there is also the distress for all concerned associated with the unwanted child and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable psychologically and otherwise to care for it
1090143 i can construct a libertarian argument for a right not to parent but once the pregnancy leaves the sacred space of the individual body both the logical and the emotional arguments get a lot weaker what will society look like when unwanted pregnancies start turning once again into unwanted kids
1090144 we cant force a woman to be a mother against her will how dare we but if youre a man pay child support or go to jail
1090145 the detriment that the state would impose upon the pregnant woman by denying this choice altogether is apparent
1090146 what pro choicers really care about not having a kid
1090147 the right of privacy whether it be founded in the fourteenth amendments concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action as we feel it is or as the district court determined in the ninth amendments reservation of rights to the people is broad enough to encompass a womans decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy
1090148 there may be no virtue in subsidizing housing for any segment of the population but if were going to do it for owners theres no reason to selectively disadvantage renters

1090197 we are hard pressed to imagine a better candidate a significant positive catalyst for mot shares
1090198 motorola scored a coup yet we do not expect that even the talented dr jha can have any substantial impact on motorolas roadmap until q4 2009 at the very earliest
1090199 a huge surprise to us and the street a very good choice to lead mot into the smart phone transition
1090200 motorola has made a great choice he is very well qualified to lead mobile devices back from the brink but he will need help especially in the areas of platforms and software we continue to prefer qualcomm over motorola but admit that things are getting interesting in chicago
1090201 a stunning win for motorola he is one of the stars of the wireless world
1090202 a strong choice sanjay not only adds technical expertise and strong carrier relationships but he also should help motorola attain and attract talent

1090210 you seem to suggest that had the unions been given more power a seat on the board etc they would have exercised that power in a more far sighted manner
1090211 well they did but im not sure its fair to blame management
1090212 its not our fault those mean ole factwy workers made us make all these bad decisions mean ole stupid ole factwy workers
1090213 nor can us automakers design plants with lines as flexible as do foreign non union automakers for labor reasons workers cant simply be laid off and no longer paid as a result of market demand so gm is always faced with an expensive nightmare of buyouts or simply paying people who no longer work for the company whether you understand how or not labor issues infuse everything about an auto company
1090214 gms historical pension and healthcare obligations and the vast difficulties they have in permanently laying off workers mean that the company had to maximize cash flow as best they could
1090215 this whole national healthcare thing seems like a giant subsidy for business corporate welfare if you will i thought that libs dems were supposed to be opposed to such things
1090216 the workers on the floor do what they are told
1090217 bad workers could not be fired and good workers could not be easily hired
1090218 you mean that for example that if line workers are wiring headlights they might not make sure that they return to ground that if they are giving the chassis an undercoat they might apply it to the windows go on with these tales i for one would like to hear them
1090219 you need to hire more union quality control workers instead
1090220 or do you mean that if they are told they have to work overtime they check with their union rep first
1090221 bad workers could not be fired and good workers could not be easily hired
1090222 no one held a gun to gms head and forced them to sell gas hogs
1090223 such and such ceo got a so i deserve at least a
1090224 your standards for unacceptable behaviour seems to be that they wont do everything the company tells them to do
1090225 actually this is a case where perception lags reality recent gm vehicles are comparable in quality to japanese vehicles and resale values are rising accordingly
1090226 of one power even god is deprived and that is the power of making what is past never to have been
1090227 theres either a significant amount of money behind this or this is state sponsored or this is stuff that was stolen from the former soviet program
1090228 note how soundarajan is not identified as a male in the new york times the article uses feminine pronouns for goodness sake her only crime was being intersexed having one of those genetic abnormalities that can cause the test to yield false results in fact it doesnt appear that there are any cases of this kind of screening revealing men cheating by pretending to be women at this level of competition at all
1090229 the fact that men have greater genetic variability is such a non issue founded proven and non controversial that its actually rare to find a
1090230 whatever the explanation it is a statistical fact that the variance of the distribution of abilities among males is greater than the variance of the distribution for females
1090231 the purpose of this page is to present a hypothesis of rodolfo a
1090232 youre wrong even tho i have nothing to support me
1090233 all the research ive done points to a gender difference in general cognitive ability there is a mean difference of about five iq points the further you go up the distribution the more and more skewed it becomes there are twice as many men with an iq of 120 plus as there are women
1090234 sex differences in both mean and variance contribute to the preponderance of men in the academy but they contribute unequally at this level of ability men predominate mostly because of their greater variability if we set the mean difference to zero and redo the calculation men would constitute 91 of the academy membership down from 95 but still a hefty majority alternatively if we set the variance ratio to unity leaving the means intact the male representation drops substantially to 64

1090236 in a perfect world all patches would be deployed and things would be just fine
1090237 cant get their own companies to agree there is a problem until they show that an attack can actually happen they have disagreements about whether or not they are insecure so one of the values of core impact is that it helps them to justify internally the need for patches
1090238 that has taken a lot of pressure off the market it looks like the thinking is that we dodged another bullet
1090239 they still have expensive gas to feed into the system so theyre reluctant to drop prices
1090240 prices never come down as fast as they go up
1090241 the market is increasing the odds now that the drilling deal will get done and we will see more production coming out of the gulf of mexico
1090242 the oil markets main focus right now is on any weakness that signals a slowdown in the economy and this personal spending report is further evidence of that
1090243 hell just be a little tropical storm tyke compared to big mamas that rip things up and spike gas prices
1090244 thomas mougard is a young man who doesnt belong in this story

1090246 we have the feeling that weve come a bit closer to the truth

1090265 who seeks such an approach is really seeking a religious war
1090266 when the muslims came here they never found any standing building or any culture still alive so they never threatened any standing building
1090267 we are not going to entertain theories about buildings that may or may not have been here before
1090268 its difficult to approach a gate while passing through cemeteries through graves
1090269 after the blocking of the gate and people stop using the gate people made use of the area by burying their dead
1090270 i can barely keep up with the wife i have why would i want
1090271 i realised i was grateful because there were people i could go to talk to whereas if wed still been in east africa that may not have been the case
1090272 i realised i lived in a society where the story of who we are as a people was not finished which meant that i as an individual mattered i could be a partial author of this grander story

1090298 tva has no indication that sensitive or restricted data has been compromised
1090299 the total number possibly affected is eight and they are all tva employees they have been notified and have not experienced any problems with their personal information
1090300 there was an investigation the union was involved and that culminated in the arrangement
1090301 it will play itself and the case is going to go away as simple as that
1090302 chances are theyre going to lose their job which i guess is more than the average citizen pays
1090303 maybe were held to a higher standard if you dont like that then dont get in the business
1090304 too often theres a presumption that police officers check their civil rights at the station door and thats just not true
1090305 a little bit more care should be placed in the types of assignments that we are giving these children
1090306 it would seem to me that the teacher would then put in there do not write anything that refers to sex drugs alcohol or violence
1090307 it was always about safety his safety the teachers safety the schools safety
1090308 the arrest and charges were clearly warranted by the cary police department the police were obligated in the circumstances to do whatever legally possible they could to ensure the safety of mr lee the students and the school
1090309 so i had this dream last night where i went into a building pulled out two p90s and started shooting everyone then had sex with the dead bodies will not really but it would be funny if i did
1090310 the fact that our operations division and public safety department have not only met the requirements to pass the inspection but to go six years without a noted deficiency is quite an accomplishment
1090311 we are trying to represent our client zealously within the bounds of the law
1090312 but its not like it has gone away and no other crop has taken its place

1090333 lo que no va a hacer es no reclamar los suyos
1090334 prefiere sin ninguna duda y como todo el pp que se mantenga el sistema nacional de aeropuertos antes de que se disgregue

1090355 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1090356 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1090357 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1090358 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month

1090380 in six years i have secured over 7 4 million in federal earmarks for this project and have been pleased to support birminghams efforts to build a long overdue and more modern transit hub downtown
1090381 the facility will be a state of the art transportation hub for the citizens of birmingham as well as tourists and visitors that come to the city
1090382 this is a great first step towards revamping and revitalizing mass transit in birmingham

1090391 so my advice is leave these men alone let them go if they are planning and doing these things merely on their own it will soon be overthrown but if it is from god you will not be able to overthrow them you may even find yourselves fighting against god

1090473 the portuguese attorney general in his recent statement made it very clear indeed that theres absolutely no evidence of any wrongdoing by kate and gerry in any way shape or form and journalists should bear that in mind when they examine the police files
1090474 a lot of this is historical detail drafted by officers who failed to find madeleine and who quite wrongfully were going down inaccurate lines of supposition and assumption
1090475 kate and gerry are no longer arguidos formal suspects the portuguese judicial system has accepted that they were not involved in madeleines disappearance in any way shape or form and these files should be seen in that context
1090476 all that matters is the search for madeleine kate and gerrys lawyers are continuing to examine all of the information in minute detail and where anything that is relevant to finding madeleine needs to be done it will be

1090506 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1090507 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1090508 this transformation will be costly and given the fiscal disaster we will inherit from the last administration it will likely require us to defer some other priorities
1090509 like all compromises this one has its drawbacks it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1090510 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1090511 like george bush and dick cheney before him he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than 1 million from big oil just last month
1090512 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1090513 a windfall profits tax on big oil to give families a thousand dollar rebate

1090519 the american people want strong national defense and they want the government to protect them from further attack they want lower taxes and less government they want strong principled leadership and that is precisely what republicans will give them
1090520 we make money the old fashioned way we print it
1090521 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets now big oils filling john mccains campaign with 2 million in contributions because instead of taxing their windfall profits to help drivers mccain wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another barack obama a windfall profits tax on big oil to give families a 1 000 rebate a president wholl stand up for you

1090556 it wasnt your fathers fault that he left you know i divorced him when the two of us got married your grandparents werent happy with the idea but they said okay they probably couldnt have stopped us anyway and they eventually came around to the idea that it was the right thing to do then baracks father your grandfather hussein wrote gramps this long nasty letter saying that he didnt approve of the marriage he didnt want the obama blood sullied by a white woman he said well you can imagine how gramps reacted to that and then there was a problem with your fathers first wife he had told me they were separated but it was a village wedding so there was no legal document that could show a divorce
1090557 my mother and lolo would remain cordial through the birth of my sister maya
1090558 the newspaper quoted zulfan adi who described himself as one of obamas closest childhood friends
1090559 but barry was a muslim i remember him wearing a sarong
1090560 i nterviews with dozens of former classmates teachers neighbors and friends show that obama was not a regular practicing muslim when he was in indonesia
1090561 he stopped using marijuana and cocaine completely in college or whether his drug use extended into his law school days or beyond
1090562 barack obama admitted using drugs in his autobiography but never revealed if or when he stopped
1090563 was working as a community organizer out of the harlem campus of the city college of new york
1090564 after leaving harvard graham felsen published an article in an avowedly socialist magazine

1090566 found the house for obama salon com reported that donna schwan of metro pro realty the real estate agent who listed the property recalled the deal starting when rezko expressed interest in the listing
1090567 asked who approached her about the house schwan told salon i honestly dont remember
1090568 i saw this house i really like it its more than we originally budgeted for id like you to take a look at it
1090569 in his prepared statement obama told the sun times that michelle fell in love with the house
1090570 the boston globe also reported real estate agent schwans recollection that the obamas may not have made the highest bid but that the willingness of the obamas and rita rezko to close in june was decisive
1090571 the couple who sold barack obama his chicago home said the illinois senators 1 65 million bid was the best offer and they didnt cut their asking price because a campaign donor bought their adjacent land according to e mails between obamas presidential campaign and the seller
1090572 the transcript of the question and answer session clearly shows the tribune staff had a hard time believing obama yet obama persisted denying he coordinated the purchase with rezko page 168
1090573 offered a lengthy and to us plausible explanation for the presence of now indicted businessman tony rezko in his personal and political lives
1090574 newsmaxs ronald kessler reported that obama had been in trinity united church of christ on july 22 2007 when kessler was present
1090575 blamed the white arrogance of americas caucasian majority for the worlds suffering especially the oppression of blacks
1090576 on july 22nd 2007 he davis sat next to barack obama as barack obama heard some of these same statements from that very preacher wright and was nodding along
1090577 t he obama campaign promptly posted a new denial claiming obama did not attend church services in chicago on july 22
1090578 we worked with him specifically on his strategy the republicans were in control of the illinois senate at the time they loved to hold votes on partial birth and born alive they put these bills out all the time because they wanted to pigeonhole democrats
1090579 he came to me and said my members are being attacked
1090580 a present vote was hard to pigeonhole which is exactly what obama wanted
1090581 was give cover to moderate democrats who wanted to vote with us but were afraid to do so
1090582 a present vote would protect them your senator voted present most of the electorate is not going to know what that means
1090583 pointed to the result of most democratic plans to increase corporate taxes the government ends up collecting less capital gains tax revenue not more
1090584 has pledged to reduce the size of the military page 257
1090585 obama will undoubtedly campaign in the general election saying he wants to maintain a strong military just as he will say he is fully committed to the survival of israel obamas problem is that neither position may be credible in the face of video clips that show him saying he wants to reduce the military cut nuclear weapons and pull out of iraq
1090586 increase our ground forces by 65 000 soldiers and 27 000 marines
1090587 expand to meet military needs on the ground a major stress on our troops comes from insufficient ground forces barack obama supports plans to increase the size of the army by 65 000 troops and the marines by 27 000 troops increasing our end strength will help units retrain and re equip properly between deployments and decrease the strain on military families
1090588 this is a little different from anything ive ever seen

1090904 it is disgraceful that senators would consider congratulating james dobson for his reprehensible radio broadcasts that damage families and promote discrimination
1090905 honoring a man who distorts research and misrepresents facts sends the wrong message to youth who are looking for role models do we really want young people to think lying and cheating are acceptable ways to promote a viewpoint
1090906 what dr dobson has done through the years is look at scientific data and then reach conclusions off that data that may or may not be supported by the researchers who did the research
1090907 i would agree with schneeberger that dobson is committing larceny of the lab by twisting the scientific conclusions of legitimate researchers to fit his archaic views
1090908 however it is neither moral nor ethical to cherry pick work and grossly misrepresent research to bolter an ideological agenda

1090934 the urbanism of the united states has been premised on two things
1090935 one is inexpensive land and the other is inexpensive fuel both have led to sprawl
1090936 urban planners have been beating their heads against the wall for decades trying to get americans to settle in a more compact pattern on the landscape for the very reasons were starting to see now
1090937 to be honest i feel that rising gas prices are going to do more for good sustainable urban planning than the entire urban planning profession
1090938 new urbanists such as duany who champion mixed use environments say suburbs must adapt to high gas prices by becoming more like villages central shopping should replace big box stores and their aprons of parking on the town edge and entire swaths of city blocks with nothing but houses and cul de sacs must be retrofitted to fully functioning neighborhoods with corner stores and businesses in walking distance
1090939 youll see more people buying into the idea of a more dense suburb
1090940 at 4 per gallon for gas americans are paying an average of about 500 more to fill up a car this year over last year that may dent the family budget but its hardly enough to trigger a wholesale reimagining of the american dream not to mention that new automobile technology that features plug in hybrids electric cars and hydrogen powered cars may blunt the impact of gas prices and allow plenty of americans to enjoy life as theyve known it for decades
1090941 some cities are better poised to take advantage of this urbanizing trend than others namely those that are already have strong urban cores and public transit lines
1090942 duany says hes betting on oil rich texas the very home of suburban sprawl and the derisively dubbed mcmansion
1090943 im always betting on texas its such a can do place

1090958 the terrestrial carbon cycle provides a sink for about 25 of the anthropogenic carbon emissions that increase atmospheric co2 comprehensive models based on a detailed understanding of this carbon sink are needed to inform mitigation strategies aimed at stabilizing climate and adaptation strategies to minimize biospheric impacts
1090959 in early global climate models or general circulation models gcms the land surface was merely a necessary boundary condition influencing momentum dissipation energy balance and moisture content of the atmosphere in 1983 robert dickinson was the first to explicitly represent the biophysics of ecosystems in a gcm the next generation of land models in gcms used in the intergovermental panel on climate change ipcc fourth assessment 1 incorporated biogeochemical principles of ecosystems notably the carbon cycle and vegetation controls on the water cycle photosynthesis was explicitly computed from principles grounded in cellular biochemistry with important sensitivity to changing atmospheric co2 ecosystem releases of co2 from plant respiration and decomposition of dead material were incorporated in the models to complete land carbon balances
1090960 yet a recent intercomparison illuminated a distressing disagreement of 11 land models attempting to simulate future atmospheric co2 with interactive terrestrial carbon balances
1090961 disturbances like fire change the energy water and carbon balances of a land surface dramatically and often instantly in tropical areas cropland and grazing fields are burned annually to clear away unwanted plant debris and stimulate new plant growth a fire first releases a pulse of carbon and then reduces the albedo of a surface from 15 to 20 to around 4 8 the blackened surface absorbs much more incident solar energy and with little live vegetation remaining for evaporative cooling midday surface temperatures can easily reach 50 c albedo may recover from resprouting vegetation within a few months in a tropical grassland but require decades in a boreal forest
1090962 the next generation of gcms must additionally represent the human driven biogeographical dynamics of land cover and land use change through urbanization agricultural land conversion and grazing deforestation episodic disturbances and the feedback responses of these processes to the atmosphere according to current satellite based estimates 17 million km2 or 14 of the land surface has been changed by human agricultural activity and another 28 is used for domestic animal grazing
1090963 our paper documents that land use change impacts regional and global climate through the surface energy budget as well as through the carbon cycle the surface energy budget effects may be more important than the carbon cycle effects however land use impacts on climate cannot be adequately quanti fied with the usual metric of global warming potential a new metric is needed to quantify the human disturbance of the earths surface energy budget this regional climate change potential could offer a new metric for developing a more inclusive climate protocol this concept would also implicitly provide a mechanism to monitor potential local scale environmental changes that could influence biodiversity
1090964 strategies to mitigate anthropogenic climate change recognize that carbon sequestration in the terrestrial biosphere can reduce the build up of carbon dioxide in the earths atmosphere however climate mitigation policies do not generally incorporate the effects of these changes in the land surface on the surface albedo the fluxes of sensible and latent heat to the atmosphere and the distribution of energy within the climate system changes in these components of the surface energy budget can affect the local regional and global climate given the goal of mitigating climate change it is important to consider all of the effects of changes in terrestrial vegetation and to work toward a better understanding of the full climate system acknowledging the importance of land surface change as a component of climate change makes it more challenging to create a system of credits and debits wherein emission or sequestration of carbon in the biosphere is equated with emission of carbon from fossil fuels recognition of the complexity of human caused changes in climate does not however weaken the importance of actions that would seek to minimize our disturbance of the earths environmental system and that would reduce societal and ecological vulnerability to environmental change and variability

1090966 the decision of dominican justice complemented by that group of totally independent opinions shows that the accusation by you and some of your economic team officials against my government is totally unfounded and politicking
1090967 it was possible to be conclude from the analysis of those experts that the banking crisis was the result of a fraud that began in 1989 and exploded in 2003 when the intervention of the government that i presided takes place

1090993 this is not something were going to do once and then go away and never do it again
1090994 when that will be or how long that will be god only knows but we acquired it specifically because we wanted to own it and develop it and work on it like we do with the elder scrolls
1090995 the whole reason we went out and acquired the licence and that we now own fallout is that we clearly intended to make more than one
1090996 this is not something were going to do once and then go away and never do it again

1090998 in my brief and shallow internet search i couldnt find anything from reubens himself stating that he is gay
1090999 i take it this isnt one of linos jobs then
1091000 yeah i guess so he calls tells me to round up a couple guys there was this sound in his voice i could tell there was no time for dilly dallying
1091001 did you call him or is he getting rousted as well
1091002 i dont really like to announce my movements ya know well knock him out of bed and get that ugly wife of his to make us some eggs
1091003 i think jackie would prefer us proteinated and ready for action
1091004 no when youre cindy crawford its a beauty mark when youre lula swedlow its a fucking mole plus she has no ass to speak of maybe thats your idea of good fucking but its not mine
1091005 but im not even open to the prospect of maybe one day liking deputy dave like i cant even see the day when that could happen and ive got a pretty good imagination
1091006 i heard ya pull up three thirty in the morning
1091007 but i dont think lino would care for us fucking around in a rival capos territory even if we are on a freelance
1091008 i assume if jackie set this up everything is copasetic
1091009 arent you even a little bit worried jackie knocks us out of bed in the middle of the night doesnt even bother to call stacey and he wants us to meet him behind nazi lines doesnt that freak you out just a bit
1091010 yeah it sucks this whole thing sucks but jackie called and we dont get paid to think things suck when jackie calls
1091011 this feels like look jackie means a lot to all of us but this feels like a set up
1091012 yeah well just in case ive got four ghetto sweepers in the trunk that make you feel better you paranoid fuck
1091013 heh its probably the same car he drove in high school
1091014 benedetto wouldnt want the cops sneaking around here but i guess he could have it routed to his cell
1091015 so youre saying benedetto or his boys could be on their way right now

1091024 you may find a 300 000 or 350 000 bargain in california or florida but understand that five years down the road that home may be roughly the same price in real terms after inflation
1091025 job creation in an area will determine which way house prices are going in a region in the years ahead much more than how bad the local housing market is now
1091026 in general lower home prices and the large inventory of homes give the advantage to the buyer but they also increase the buyers equity risk and thats something you dont hear realtors talk too much about
1091027 prices are lower now but keep in mind prices are likely to fall even more in most regions of the country so if you buy now but have to sell in two or three years due to a relocation you may end up losing a great deal of money i would not buy a home now unless i absolutely needed the space for example for a growing family
1091028 while its true the best house on the block generally starts with the highest value it is not true that the best house is more protected against price declines
1091029 the best house could end up losing more value in percentage and absolute terms than the median house on the block because its price contained a bigger bubble a larger artificially high price due to the wealth effect of the recent housing boom

1091035 op dit moment zijn er in nederland geen mosselgebieden met toxine gelokaliseerd

1091096 since the past one year after my tenure as governor of delta state i have watched with silence the unfolding events around me i have also watched with deep silence the negative media publicity orchestrated by people who have sworn that i shall know no peace
1091097 owing to media inquiries over the nature chief james onanefe iboris 50th birthday celebration would take i have to explain that chief ibori wants a very quiet reflective and prayerful anniversary one bereft of fanfare chief ibori the former delta state governor has chosen the occasion as a time of sober reflection both on his personal and public life
1091098 he is doing this despite calls from well meaning nigerians to massively celebrate the occasion
1091099 age fifty is very significant in the life of a man
1091100 since the past one year after my tenure as governor of delta state i have watched with silence the unfolding events around me
1091101 as challenging as this is i have elected to view it as one of the sacrifices of post public service life in nigeria it is unfortunate though that innocent nigerians may be deceived by these lies from people of shallow consciences
1091102 i am not about to join issues with my detractors who have been crying for my crucifixion just because delta state or national politics have not gone their way
1091103 i consider it at variance with modesty and humility the bedrock of my upbringing to begin to sing the songs of my achievements within the eight years i was governor of delta state yet vestiges of my passionate drive for human and infrastructural development in the state will ever remain
1091104 the records are there but i leave that issue to posterity to judge
1091105 i must use this opportunity to thank everyone who has stood up for me in my challenging moments friends associates and well wishers across the political party lines members of my political family in the pdp both at the national and state levels the governor of delta state and his cabinet and indeed the good people of delta state

1091135 we turned our backs upon the spirit and embraced all that is material with excessive and unwarranted zeal
1091136 however in early democracies as in american democracy at the time of its birth all individual human rights were granted because man is gods creature that is freedom was given to the individual conditionally in the assumption of his constant religious responsibility such was the heritage of the preceding thousand years two hundred or even fifty years ago it would have seemed quite impossible in america that an individual could be granted boundless freedom simply for the satisfaction of his instincts or whims subsequently however all such limitations were discarded everywhere in the west a total liberation occurred from the moral heritage of christian centuries with their great reserves of mercy and sacrifice mans sense of responsibility to god and society grew dimmer and dimmer in the past decades the legalistically selfish aspect of western approach and thinking has reached its final dimension and the world wound up in a harsh spiritual crisis and a political impasse all the glorified technological achievements of progress including the conquest of outer space do not redeem the twentieth centurys moral poverty which no one could imagine even as late as in the nineteenth century

1091138 most of the guns we encounter on the street are stolen
1091139 most of the people who have guns in their homes have never seen a problem its when guns leave the home that we have problems
1091140 in my view there simply is no untouchable constitutional right guaranteed by the second amendment to keep loaded handguns in the house in crime ridden urban areas
1091141 with the concealed weapons statute we have had very little problems our law abiding citizens take the courses and follow the law
1091142 i concur with todays landmark decision by the u s supreme court which emphasizes what so many have long understood the right to bear arms is a fundamental civil right like the freedoms of speech and to vote and its important that governments at all levels not infringe on those fundamental rights
1091143 we want to protect the history and the heritage of it its not the tart that comes form bakewell its the pudding
1091144 we are declaring what our recipe is what goes into it how it is made taste shape colour everything like that just to specify this is how it is made
1091145 we use the puffed pastry base whereas everybody who makes the bakewell tart uses a short crust base
1091146 it is one of the few places in the uk that you can honestly say that a product has been made generation after generation
1091147 we are protecting the pudding from outsiders selling an inferior product which is what is beginning to happen

1091153 searching for initiatives to make its fleet more energy efficient
1091154 this is all about attracting staff using different modes of delivery because of the problems australia post is having attracting staff with motorbike licences
1091155 they are doing this to reduce costs minimise potential accidents on the road and also reduce fuel costs
1091156 if they could wave the magic wand and get all their delivery done without using a motorbike yes they would
1091157 we are arguing that the reason they have motorbikes is it is the most efficient mode of delivery
1091158 at the moment those rounds are having to be covered by the other posties who are doing extra work
1091159 they can only do that for so long before they chuck it in it is getting to be a real pressure point
1091160 there is no petrol involved at all petrol is yesterdays technology
1091161 however this is not a motorcycle they are power assisted bicycles the motor is there to assist pedalling not a substitute for it
1091162 fuel costs and a need for cleaner forms of delivery mean some areas could benefit from these alternative forms of transport and we are keen to explore this possibility
1091163 we are also trying alternative fuels such as propane natural gas and lpg and using the new gas injected diesel technology
1091164 in addition we have in the past 12 months undertaken a hybrid truck trial which has demonstrated benefits both in terms of reduced fuel consumption and lower emissions but unfortunately currently has a limited application to our fleet

1091167 we will continue to work with childcare centres and pre schools to address problems as they arise but if they consistently fail to fix any identified issues then we will take more serious action such as prosecution or revoking operators licences
1091168 these are the key issues thats why well be making sure that anyone who breaks those and faces prosecution when they are prosecuted they will be put on this website

1091172 outside interests are trying to manipulate the situation in tripoli
1091173 syria is the cause of the fighting in tripoli no doubt
1091174 the fighting is not spontaneous but i dont want to name anybody as responsible
1091175 they dont know what they are doing the syrians are duping them letting them pay for their dirty work
1091176 cannot stop the salafists from fighting march 14 is now much weakened this changes the rules of the sunni shia game in lebanon
1091177 we are a small country maybe a bargaining chip but i do not believe that the international community will allow syria back into lebanon

1091206 i know its a lot of money to play back at home but if you have a contract you finish it and then youre free to do whatever you want dumont said
1091207 thats something we dont want to see in hockey you see it in some other sports and i think as hockey players were kind of proud that players dont just walk away from a contract
1091208 have a lot of explaining to do during training camp
1091209 not only to the players but i think to fans too dumont said
1091210 this summer so many people have come up to me and asked me about him

1091230 israel decided to take the humanitarian decision to transfer to jericho 87 residents of the shujaiya neighbourhood in gaza because of the violence carried out by hamas
1091231 we talked with them on the bus and we told them that jericho and the west bank are different from the gaza strip and that the israeli army controls this region they have to respect the law
1091232 are mainly young people aged between 14 and 20 years who will remain in jericho indefinitely their families will not be allowed to join them
1091233 received information that they were being arrested by hamas and that their lives were in immediate danger
1091234 we never wanted anyone to leave in this regrettable way
1091235 this is a path that does harm to them because by the mere act of fleeing a person places himself in the realm of suspicion
1091236 we condemn the criminal acts undertaken by the hamas leadership against the palestinian people in shujaiya in gaza
1091237 its something that we had to produce and put out there but that depth chart that you have in your hand wont be the same this afternoon let alone tomorrow

1091315 according a report by the u s department of justice 47 of every 100 000 inmates in local jails across the country in 2002 committed suicide that is down from 129 of every 100 000 inmates in 1983
1091316 i was hoping to have added to the squad by now and brought a few in to give the players a lift
1091317 its not just a new face we need its new faces
1091318 my big concern is that anybody we bring in now probably wont be ready to start the premier league season
1091319 its now getting to the stage where you are wondering how long it takes for new players to settle etc

1091326 due to personal issues stemming from the death of his wife nancy
1091327 i wonder where those rumors came from i guess the police will figure that out eventually
1091328 revealed no information that was posted about the homicide prior to june 25 2007
1091329 i have not read anything which makes me question the integrity and thoroughness of the investigation and the quality of work done by the detectives their role was to determine who committed the crimes and to ensure that no third party was involved in the murders their role was not to determine if wwe may have acted or not acted in a manner to control the publicity of the heinous crimes committed by one of its stars
1091330 only those families with a working wife have seen real improvement in their living standards
1091331 fuct the overlord we are about to arm the rahma lama ding dong then we will raise the soul of allie rahlla bahlla then i will be the overlord

1091353 once again we see articles in the paper which are being supported by the labour party that do not give a clear picture of the facts these will become clear once the matter has been resolved

1091359 the odd thing is that obama bears a distinct resemblance to the most cherished hero in chick lit history the senator is a modern incarnation of the clever haughty reserved and fastidious mr darcy
1091360 like the leading man of jane austen and bridget jones obama can as austen wrote draw
1091361 what theyve done is they put our plays into the video game and then they put in our opponents defenses
1091362 how did this kid get into my office where are my guards
1091363 itll be all right i promise we can do it
1091364 it feels nice that ive been added to the list
1091365 well considering the fact that you towed me back from the desert i think i should have the pleasure of knowing
1091366 would you believe me if i told you my full name
1091367 my mother originally named me ahaziah raine hirsch happy now
1091368 itll be all right i promise we can do it
1091369 from the stories weve heard from the beach a wave crashed over him and thats the last that was seen of him
1091370 i wish on a selfish note that hed not done what he has done but im phenomenally proud of him
1091371 ive always been proud of him as a brother and as a friend too but he wouldnt have had a choice
1091372 one thing we said when we were in st lucia is that if hed not gone in or if hed gone in and got himself out but one of the children hadnt he probably wouldnt have been able to live with himself
1091373 realistically if im being honest ive probably begun to accept that we are not going to see him alive again id love for him to walk through the door now but i dont know
1091374 are our questions or if they are not already they will be the double headed eagle is one of our symbols not the double headed ostrich i ask two questions of your time did they clearly proclaim jesus christ as the only lord and savior of the world and did the bishops uphold marriage and the sanctity of the family how should i answer to the first question yes christ was proclaimed as lord there was the uniqueness of the incarnation to the second question im still wondering where is there a plain statement of the sanctity of marriage what about lambeth 1 10 does not truth matter more than outward unity
1091375 we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers
1091376 listening to god and each other the bishop and human sexuality
1091377 im more than a little frustrated as i begin to speak my mind because i am aware there are others here who want to speak and now we are all but out of time
1091378 responsibility keeps pace with spiritual development the more a man carries the more he is capable of carrying god fits the back to the burden and the burden to the back
1091379 arent we bishops in the church it is a bit more complicated than this isnt it
1091380 well spend the first few days trying to get an assessment of everyone and find out who is going to help us but overall the offense looked crisp
1091381 i couldnt over throw anyone to save my life last season
1091382 its a lot easier to take some off the passes than put some on
1091383 we are tired of seven eight nine win seasons we have the talent to do better than that and we realize its up to us
1091384 its a great problem to have and there is a good chance well see both in the backfield a lot he said
1091385 there are plenty of reps for both those guys to go around
1091386 sometimes when a person is gone and you dont see him for a while you kind of wonder if you remember him right then we come in see his face and say yes thats how we remember him his friends come over all of the time just to hang out
1091387 he ran for 950 yards in his junior season and he wasnt even the featured back on our team he wouldve had a monster senior season as the main back in our offense i really thought he couldve played at byu or utah he wouldve been a glue guy someone that wouldve found a home in the program
1091388 seth was willing to do whatever it took to win games
1091389 they wanted to go out there swim around and tease their friends
1091390 halfway out they realized they wouldnt make it there and turned around
1091391 i thought it was something that i should do alone
1091392 i told sennett that if he didnt want to be there he didnt have to be he told me that if i was going to do it he wanted to be by my side it was unbelievable for a 15 year old to say that he and my son kyle were unbelievable sources of strength to me in the entire ordeal
1091393 his skin color was good he looked like he was sleeping
1091394 my intensely awkward position is representative of the church at large
1091395 let us bite our liberal tongues for the sake of unity let us suffer the accusations of appeasing the homophobes for the sake of unity let us put our desire for an inclusive church on hold for the sake of unity let us be patient
1091396 is all about the creation of a set of rules that will systematically make gospel faith all but impossible for anglicans in the 21st century
1091397 say to people here you got to go along with conventional wisdom and they say no you dont
1091398 i spent a year mostly as chief of operations to the us commanding general in iraq as chief of operations i ran all the operations of all the forces in iraq at the highest level in a critical year for the war this gave me a unique perspective for an australian on modern war
1091399 yours is to do or die not to have opinions
1091400 no no you taxpayers we here in the military are way way over resourced please take back all this gear and sell it to finance health and education
1091401 i do not believe that we are giving our servicemen and women the tools the knowledge and the attitude to fight effectively in a modern combat environment either in battles or campaigns when the government decides it is appropriate
1091402 it is hard for the adf to criticize government policy because after years of neglect we are very thankful for any resources thrown our way
1091403 i dont know what weapons world war iii will be fought with but i do know that world war four will be fought with sticks and stones
1091404 like the global warming racket we are talking about a group of post modern leftist lunatics
1091405 avoiding war by having bigger toys than the other boys
1091406 over the last two decades there have been thousands of peer reviewed scientific studies of climate variability and change leading to understanding of the causes of recent global warming
1091407 wow i didnt see it like that ill change from now on
1091408 i can just see the sceptics chewing the fat over this one
1091409 fortunately human history has usually demonstrated very clearly the foolishness and destructiveness of this sort of attitude
1091410 is solar power a threat to big energy companies we must have about 12 14 hours of sunlight coast to coast in australia i wish i knew why we are not using the sun to its fullest extent seems crazy to me but as i said at the top i know virtually nothing
1091411 gee i may be simple but i dont see how such a small percent of carbon can hurt
1091412 my scientific friends tell me that a warmer climate means better palnt growth
1091413 global average temperatures have dropped from 2002 to 2008 while carbon dioxide has increased so carbon dioxide cant cause long term warming this is another false conclusion there are large natural year to year variations in climate the warming influence due to increasing greenhouse gases is at global scales and cumulative over many years
1091414 carbon dioxide is such a minor atmospheric constituent that it cant affect global climate this is untrue while carbon dioxide makes up only 0 038 of the atmosphere it is vital in the energy balance of the earths surface and atmosphere if the atmosphere contained no greenhouse gases the surface temperature would be about 30c colder
1091415 the simple minded will believe anything but the wise looketh well into everything he does
1091416 if the north american churches dont accept the need for moratoria then to say the least we are no further forward
1091417 that means as a communion we continue to be in grave peril
1091418 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight
1091419 but the christian with the new insight cant claim straight away that this is now what the church of god believes or intends
1091420 for people who think that this is going to lead us to disenfranchise any gay or lesbian person they are sadly mistaken
1091421 substantial theological voices outside of the western world have not been present in the evening plenary sessions of the lambeth conference we are concerned with the continuing patronising attitude of the west towards the rest of the churches worldwide
1091422 we regret attempts to cause divisions and break the bonds between churches in the global south and are distressed that the realities in our churches are often misrepresented and misunderstood in the west
1091423 stand in solidarity with all the faithful bishops clergy and laity in the united states and canada and elsewhere who are suffering recrimination and hostility perpetrated upon them by their dioceses and or national churches which have not unequivocally complied with the specific windsor proposals required of them in full
1091424 the anglican communion as a communion of ordered churches is at the probable brink of collapse
1091425 the pastoral forum should be empowered to act in the anglican communion in a rapid manner to emerging threats to its life especially through the ministry of its chair who should work alongside the archbishop of canterbury in the exercise of his ministry the forum would be responsible for addressing those anomalies of pastoral care arising in the communion against the recommendations of the windsor report it could also offer guidance on what response and any diminished standing within the communion might be appropriate where any of the three moratoria are broken
1091426 committed to work together with one another in the global south and with all orthodox groups in the united states of america and canada to listen together to what lord jesus says to his church today to draw strength and insights from one another and to take fresh initiatives in upholding and passing on the faith once delivered to the saints
1091427 i feel a great deal of what i hoped for has happened
1091428 weve found that very slowly theres a slightly different way of doing business what we havent had is a very consistent counter narrative flowing through the conference from people feeling disenfranchised
1091429 i felt that archbishop orombis comments slightly misunderstood the role of the archbishop of canterbury as if the archbishop directed the communion its a historical given that this is where this particular mission began from and the archbishop retains permission to convene the communion no one has come up with a coherent alternative
1091430 how would you effect a quick separation it sounds easier than it is actually not easier it just sounds quicker than it possibly could be
1091431 and their language that speaks of two churches i dont think thats been the experience of the overwhelming majority of the people at this conference what you see at the eucharist every morning is not two churches
1091432 every conference ive been to has that rhythm where at some point everybody loses confidence in the process but when things went wobbly it was important to say that we dont try to revise the conferences agenda on the back of an envelope and theres a theology to it its something to do with a belief that unity is an active matter not just a goal to be achieved
1091433 id expect it to feel physically tiring because its a long physical day jane and i both thought wed commit to the process so we pray with everybody in the morning
1091434 on the few evenings weve been able to knock off by 9 pm and unwind a bit thats helped with coping
1091435 those are moments when you think the communion really matters because those people can bring a global perspective to a local situation
1091436 there may be a complicated development issue that we can broker to introduce people from that sort of world to people in government here over the past couple of weeks is what this is about these relationships are not a waste of time
1091437 he was to be operated on and there was very little hope of him surviving the operation the doctors said
1091438 a friend of his was in contact with the sisters and knew about elizabeth prout and he recommended that the family should pray to her
1091439 the whole family together with their friends prayed through the intercession of elizabeth prout for his cure
1091440 when the doctors came to operate they did a preliminary x ray or scan and they found no sign of the cancer being there
1091441 she gave herself completely to god she constantly searched for the will of god and she endured such hardships to carry out the will of god

1091447 this is the message we have heard from him and declare to you god is light in him there is no darkness at all if we claim to have fellowship with him yet walk in the darkness we lie and do not live by the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus his son purifies us from all sin
1091448 total and collegial commitment to the solemn vocation of the global south
1091449 global south anglican theological formation and education task force anglican catechism in outline a common home between us
1091450 to work with those aspects of the conferences agenda that relate to implementing the recommendations of windsor including the development of a covenant
1091451 the pastoral forum should be empowered to act in the anglican communion in a rapid manner to emerging threats to its life especially through the ministry of its chair who should work alongside the archbishop of canterbury in the exercise of his ministry the forum would be responsible for addressing those anomalies of pastoral care arising in the communion against the recommendations of the windsor report it could also offer guidance on what response and any diminished standing within the communion might be appropriate where any of the three moratoria are broken
1091452 if you have any encouragement from being united with christ if any comfort from his love if any fellowship with the spirit if any tenderness and compassion then make my joy complete by being like minded having the same love being one in spirit and purpose

1091464 we just have to prove that there was a traffic infraction in this case that would be crossing the double yellow line and death resulted from that

1091466 for large employers who have 10 or more employees workers can earn up to nine paid sick days for smaller businesses they can earn up to five paid sick days
1091467 some employers have said that theyll have to forgo raises for their employees there wont be bonuses they may have to cut back on vacation time in very severe cases we might see some job losses and cutting back on hours

1091493 i imagine he only used that description of rugby league because it was a national description and thus a very common term
1091494 i see it as a real positive for our playing group and our club to have somebody of bens standard as a footballer to set an example on the training track and its great for our young players coming through
1091495 ben really wants to be a part of the playing group he really wants to get back into the club environment and wants to see where hes at from a footballing perspective
1091496 from meetings with ben ive been really impressed by what he wanted to do and what he wanted to achieve by being with us
1091497 you see the condition hes in currently hes well and truly preparing himself
1091498 hes an absolute professional and he was always classified as one of the best trainers at west coast and its the kind of workmanlike mentality he has that will set him up well and truly for next year
1091499 i imagine he only used that description of rugby league because it was a national description and thus a very common term
1091500 jeffs a leader to all the aboriginal boys at the club and also to a lot of younger guys
1091501 i would like to see him stick around for a couple more years because i reckon wiz farmer is a great leader on the field and a lot of boys look up to him
1091502 if ive got anything to talk about hes always there to back me up hes sort of like another brother to me
1091503 i havent spoken to wiz about his future i think hes spoken to his manager but the way ive seen it i think hell be playing on next year
1091504 i imagine he only used that description of rugby league because it was a national description and thus a very common term
1091505 i imagine he only used that description of rugby league because it was a national description and thus a very common term
1091506 i think deans has got no choice now hes got to throw him in there
1091507 weve got one of the best lineout exponents in the world in dan vickerman hes been injured and came on as a replacement but weve got to obviously shore that up because the south africans are fairly good in the lineout with victor matfield so weve got to get our basics right
1091508 it will be tough and im not saying they can do it but theyve got probably more chance of defeating the springboks than the wallabies
1091509 itll be a horror trip for the wallabies theres no doubt about it
1091510 just going on past history as much as were bad in new zealand were probably worse in south africa
1091511 i think burgess came on to the scene with a great hullabaloo i think hes played reasonably well i think hes probably a little bit off the pace at the moment
1091512 hes only a young guy and i guess like everybody when the forwards are doing well you look okay
1091513 but what we want our players to do is under pressure theyve got to rise to the occasion and i think luke burgess was probably missing a little bit and it probably reflected on the way matt played
1091514 i imagine he only used that description of rugby league because it was a national description and thus a very common term
1091515 i am trying to find an answer to that question i did notice the haze

1091518 that was a bit unbelievable and it took the security a good five minutes to get out of there
1091519 he could have done anything to fui it was pretty scary
1091520 he was lucky fui didnt punch him in the head knock him out
1091521 i dont know what he was on i think he was already off his head

1091530 theyve been two of our best players all year and both are probably in the best form of their career
1091531 theyre playing a lot of consistent footy and along with ben creagh theyre probably our three big guys
1091532 it just means blokes like matty prior who was outstanding the other night and ricky thorby are going to get a little bit more time which theyre crying out for anyway and dan hunt now becomes our no 1 front rower so it puts a little bit more pressure on dan as well
1091533 theres some good challenges there for different guys these things happen youve just got to be good enough to get yourself over them

1091538 you know youre going to be very sore after you play them because theyre big and hard and like to smash you
1091539 theyre very unpredictable but you know theyre going to have their big forwards coming at you
1091540 they like to turn it up against the bigger sides and with their fan base its always tough over there

1091546 the sanction imposed on heath by the club on monday was a result of information stated by both heath and alan after being repeatedly questioned about the incident
1091547 given the club has now found their information to be false it strikes at the principles of honesty and integrity that the collingwood football club is built on
1091548 for this reason the sanction imposed today will be immediately reviewed by the club and media will be notified of a press conference to be held on tuesday
1091549 i rang him and then i saw him walking down and then because there was a bit of a crowd around me i just told him to go because i didnt really need him there at that point
1091550 heath has said that alan was not in the car with him

1091552 cricket was part of the 1900 olympics when great britain beat france but with twenty20 cricket here to stay now is the time for the 10 full member nations of the icc to plan for the development of the sport over the next 100 years
1091553 over the next century the challenge for all of us who love the game is to spread the word of cricket to parts of the globe that have never heard of it and currently dont play our sport
1091554 we have a responsibility to grow our game in new territories and amongst the women of the world
1091555 i believe the olympic games is the vehicle the sport should use to aggressively sell the message of our sport to all 202 competing olympic nations so our sport is strong and robust in countries where it is currently played and exciting and ground breaking in countries who havent yet caught the cricket bug
1091556 is it a realistic dream i really believe it is the icc has already taken the step to become a recognised olympic sport and that is the first step on the road to becoming part of the olympic program
1091557 the olympic movement knows it needs to increase its presence in the asian subcontinent as india pakistan and bangladesh contribute nearly 22 per cent of the worlds population
1091558 in theory this is a win win for the olympic movement and the icc and its members

1091561 incidents that happened with hally probably happen ten times in a game so its all getting a little tedious and boring
1091562 no one at the footy club even knew about it
1091563 he pulled his arm away it was an innocuous thing
1091564 as a footy club we probably cop it sweet if weve done the wrong thing but this is really just a barry hall fixation
1091565 six scoring shots and in the second quarter we only went inside 50 metres seven times so it was hard for him to get hold of the ball
1091566 he ended up kicking three and he couldve had six
1091567 i imagine he only used that description of rugby league because it was a national description and thus a very common term
1091568 im a bit cautious about that being in the eight i just think you can get too excited because you get absolutely no prize whatsoever for being in the eight after 21 rounds
1091569 i dont think we were totally dominant i think we lost our way a few times but we did enough to win
1091570 it was a memorable game for me because of the occasion and it was nice for the club because were up there in the eight but it wont go down in history as one of the exciting games as far as quality was concerned
1091571 i think we have to play a lot better if we want to keep our season alive
1091572 we knew that if the team lost tonight it would make it a lot harder for them but it still doesnt make it insurmountable to make the finals
1091573 but in the end you dont get to write those scripts either
1091574 i imagine he only used that description of rugby league because it was a national description and thus a very common term
1091575 we are now just days away from what i believe will be a historic olympic games
1091576 chinas role as our olympic host has opened a window to the worlds most populous nation
1091577 i am equally confident that the games will leave a great legacy for china
1091578 china is a nation in transition with a great future tremendous potential and some challenges i believe history will view the 2008 olympics as a significant milestone in chinas remarkable transformation
1091579 all of us in the olympic family hope that the beijing games will help the healing process in china and deepen the worlds knowledge of this remarkable country

1091581 i can guarantee that individual players from other clubs ring me up and thats a nice thing
1091582 they are talking about their futures and what they see in their future at port adelaide
1091583 its a nice feeling and our recruiting people as well as being certain on the lower draft picks are also concentrating on who might come through as an uncontracted player
1091584 weve got lots of flexibility in the salary cap and we look forward to the best player available coming here and making an impact straight away
1091585 thats been really worthwhile both the players and also from the other coaches you get to hear quite a bit about other players at their club as well so that was a really good thing for our club
1091586 right at the start of the year i knew how many players were out of contract and how many were borderline
1091587 the list changes will be between the three that you have to make and 10 that you can pick and choose from which is a quarter of the list if you like
1091588 wed like to have won but the result we cant get above essendon so the facts are us and fremantle and west coast are pretty similar

1091594 it doesnt matter if youre joe the milkman or whoever
1091595 regardless of whether you go to the super bowl or not youve got to learn from your mistakes
1091596 no one wants to go to jail but like i said youve got to learn from your mistakes you get punished for them i did what i had to do just to get through this
1091597 it should be over with after the second 30 days
1091598 i went to court about it and thats just what was said

1091603 a day in 1946 when id been working all night i walked out of the office about seven in the morning where people were dancing in the streets strangers were hugging each other it was the end of the war
1091604 the noise from the typewriters and things like that all added to the atmosphere of the day and just made it seem interesting and exciting
1091605 the excitement to me is no longer there as it used to be
1091606 i never aspired to be the top person i have become the top person in a number of areas but that was more through circumstances
1091607 while the body holds out and while the mind holds out ill keep doing things

1091609 i dont think percentage wise we will ever top melbourne but certainly we can get up there and we can get more gold medals but we cant beat it
1091610 we will never dominate the way we did in melbourne
1091611 in melbourne we won every single freestyle event and every relay event that is unheard of and its not going to happen again
1091612 i never compare teams because it is not fair because we did not have as many events as what the kids have got today
1091613 it is not really fair to compare i still say with the number of events the swimmers have to compete in 56 compared to now there is no comparison 56 was the greatest team ever because of the number of events
1091614 people can come from left field but i think this could be the time without putting any pressure on leisel where she can be a real star for australia
1091615 she came in as a 15 year old in sydney and was disappointed in athens had the world record and immense pressure and now she is a mature women settled down and she is there
1091616 her main opposition american jessica hardy got busted for drugs so she is out of the way and hopefully this will be a real positive olympics for jones but its the olympic games and anything can happen

1091633 made a living hunting and killing large whales by biting off their tails and flippers
1091634 it takes a lot of computing power to analyze something as relatively simple as a set of jaws since youre dealing with all sorts of complex shapes in biology
1091635 if its a relatively small target and if they are at all unsure what it is they may be biting into it might be a lump of bone or steel then its highly unlikely that youre going to see anything like their maximum bite force
1091636 its the biggest bite force known for any living animal so far although its certainly possible that the killer whale or possibly the larger crocodiles have more powerful bites
1091637 greater than for a living white shark but puny compared to big tooth
1091638 i have to say that i am pretty impressed with just how complex and sophisticated the feeding apparatus of the shark is
1091639 with all the mammalian predators ive looked at a lot of the muscle force going into the bite is actually lost the shark has a much more efficient lever system going on
1091640 these sharks go after large prey that can hurt them and theyd rather not get hurt so they attack with a single horrendously traumatizing bite and then swim back and wait for their prey to die of blood loss
1091641 even though cartilage is vastly more elastic than bone cartilage did not result in much lower bite force at all maybe 5 percent or less
1091642 most if not all cats and a lot of dog species have more powerful bites pound for pound
1091643 but because these sharks are so big you have these giant bite forces
1091644 their teeth are very sharp and serrated more or less like steak knives so they dont need that much force to puncture and tear out flesh
1091645 and they have a conveyer belt of these teeth they keep on growing rows and rows of them so the teeth fall out and are replaced well before they go blunt
1091646 estimating the bite force in a big dead fish is a tad esoteric
1091647 the way in which we model the jaws of a shark are exactly how wed model the face of a human

1091771 this lawsuit is ridiculous and riddled with lie upon lie from verne troyer and his camp it is in our opinion a transparent attempt to secure as much publicity as he can from his less than average career in the wake of his most recent failure in the love guru
1091772 the only abuse that ever occurred in their household was that of emotional abuse inflicted upon ranae and her dog lacy on the occasions when he hit ranae and her dog with his reaching sticks or kicked them when having one of his drunken rages
1091773 this alleged abuse certainly has not seemed to affect his recent round of interviews or his golf swing over the weekend is this not the same man who is renowned as a professional stuntman in all his movies

1091791 the tone of the event was as much estrogenfest as it was campaign rally as
1091792 even michigan gov jennifer m granholm got in on the girlie show as they campaigned together in struggling pontiac mich yes mrs granholm told mrs obama her state was bleeding jobs and desperate but the economic bantering did not begin until after the two term democratic governor offered a gal pal fashion compliment telling the cheering crowd of mainly black women that while she and mrs obama had something in common as harvard law school graduates she would not bare her arms in public
1091793 we think the story about michelle obamas efforts to campaign for womens votes was an important one and was fairly told but some of the language that slipped through the editing process was too breezy and could be misconstrued as stereotyping
1091794 we have taken steps to make sure such language does not slip through in the future

1091812 for a buddhist the job is trying to deal with your own innards and to try to find an awareness i would not do this participate in a protest or demonstration until i reached a level of enlightenment on a scale such as say the dalai lama who has reached such a state that he can speak out on world issues
1091813 we havent endorsed any presidential candidate a big part of one of our social plans is to battle poverty and we would like to see the next president whoever he is cut the poverty rate in half in 10 years much of that money which could be used to help the poor is now being used to fund the wars in afghanistan and iraq the election is an opportunity to shape the public debate and see hard concrete diplomacy bring an end to these wars
1091814 i wish george w bush had listened to his church or at least leaders of his own church
1091815 shortly after the war on terror began we united methodist church administrators had meetings with the pope and with senior officials of the governments of france and russia in those countries to discuss humanitarian ways of ending the war on terror the only place we couldnt get an interview was with the leadership of our own country
1091816 with vietnam many religious groups didnt show their opposition until years after the war started and there was little interfaith work against the war but with the war on terror there has been much more interfaith work among religious leaders and laymen to show that they disagree
1091817 our position was that the iraq war was based on faulty reasons the other problem is with how the war has moved on
1091818 we dont have a solution to the war on terror and we dont say we have a solution we just want muslims civil rights to be respected
1091819 unfortunately there are still many people who dont fully understand us that emotional intensity that many americans had is mostly gone but now these people anti muslim propagandists get their message out in different ways such as the internet
1091820 civil rights organisation not a religious organisation but many of our members are observant muslims
1091821 because we believe that the muslim religion is a misunderstood one so if we need to work with other religions to get the word out that we are a peaceful people thats what we will do
1091822 we hindus always pray to the gods for peace we dont tell anyone what to do or who to vote for and we never would

1091843 increased costs for environmental compliance and the need for generation and delivery infrastructure upgrades and expansion at many companies seem to indicate increased level of rate case activity over the next several years
1091844 however relatively low interest rates cost efficiencies from technological advancements the use of multi year settlements that do not specify return parameters and a reduced number of companies due to mergers may prevent the number of rate cases and equity return determinations from growing significantly in the near future

1091867 we are extremely excited about lfas pro for lenders since many common fraud schemes such as chunking flipping and multiple closings would be much more evident to lenders in pre funding
1091868 lenders now have a tool that helps them ensure the loans they are about to make are not tainted by fraudulent activity and detect patterns indicative of fraud within their loan pipeline and other contributed lender pipelines
1091869 according to the federal bureau of investigation based on existing investigations a staggering 80 percent1 of all reported mortgage fraud losses are committed by industry insiders
1091870 the mortgage industry is going through a dramatic transformation as standards are tightened and processes are changed so must the tools that detect and prevent fraud by incorporating a holistic solution like lfas lenders can ensure that the loans they make have less risk involved which contributes to more predictable revenue in the long run

1091874 seemingly gender neutral workplace norms can result in discriminatory outcomes and perpetuate gender inequality
1091875 many workplaces use face time as an important proxy signal for workers commitment or professional competence
1091876 however it should be noted that increased work hours do not assure increased productivity and more importantly it can seriously disadvantage many female workers who put in fewer hours at work than men

1091888 having different schedules especially in the beginning stages of a relationship can take the spontaneity out of romance
1091889 play a game of date tag and see who can find the most creative way to make your conflicting schedules work
1091890 if you treat this problem as a chance to work together as a team and if youre willing to occasionally sacrifice your own needs for the good of the relationship it can actually help deepen the relationship and bodes well for a more mature partnership later on
1091891 you should try to have a meal together more frequently as your schedules allow
1091892 if you get home at 8 p m and shes done with work by four in the afternoon you can have dinner together and catch up with each other in the evening if you have a day job and she starts in the late evening and works till 2 a m stop near her place of work during her break and have coffee or just a conversation
1091893 what a horrible day ive had all i want to do is eat dinner and go to sleep
1091894 every person has their own outside the relationship responsibilities and its important to take care of these so they dont intrude on your time together
1091895 for instance if you work very late and get up late in the day leaving little time to run errands or pay your bills dont ask your date to spend quality time doing chores with you instead take a half hour before or after work each day to get the bulk of the boring stuff done so you can have time for a romantic rendezvous afterward
1091896 most romances begin with the obsession phase before they settle down into reality
1091897 its hard to tell parents how to interact with their children based on one study but what we see here is that parents who have a propensity for being verbally aggressive have a tendency to try to direct and control their children during a play period
1091898 as a result these children were less cooperative and not only are parents setting up situations that are challenging for them to handle but they also are subtly undermining their childs self esteem
1091899 of course all parents direct their children and people in general are always directing others to close a door or hand them something
1091900 its something we do all the time but there is a qualitative difference in the kinds of directing going on by these verbally aggressive mothers by looking at how and when directives occurred not just how often we found that moms who scored highest on verbal aggression used directives to control the child and ultimately the way the game or activity was played the aggressive action is not overt as in a parent hitting or yelling but these small negative maneuvers can say so much to a child
1091901 we all say things to our children that we regret saying but saying a lot of things that attack a childs self confidence is not healthy
1091902 these parents were in an unstructured low stress environment and if we saw this behavior in such a brief setting how could such negative interactions even so subtle affect a child over the long term for example if the parents always have to control what activity they and their children are going to play as well as for how long and how they are going to play it you wonder if this communicates to the child that what they want to do doesnt matter
1091903 the advanced products that power todays digital economy require sophisticated technology solutions to satisfy the rigorous demands for lower power consumption higher performance and smaller form factor umcs uram effectively addresses the needs of soc designs for a broad range of applications including storage media communications and graphics and imaging systems by providing a high density memory that delivers up to a 50 percent area reduction over standard 6t sram
1091904 one of the biggest problems buyers of very expensive wines have at auctions is that they have no way of being absolutely sure if the bottle contains the wine it purports to without actually opening the bottle and taking a swig
1091905 theres no alarm that screams at you if the wines been opened
1091906 but theres no way of getting rid of the evidence of tampering because basically when tampering occurs information is erased a kind of anti alarm
1091907 our device may be able to generate a certain snob appeal factor among winemakers they can say our wine is so good we needed to spend money on this security device although only a few dollars of parts are used in the device
1091908 at a time when life saving medications are available to treat persons living with hiv there continues to be a population of hiv positive people who have fallen through the cracks
1091909 frequently their only contact with the healthcare system is during a hospitalization
1091910 we know that not being engaged in care and prevention services is not only bad for the individuals but is also bad for society in that a substantial fraction of hiv infected crack users engage in behavior that transmits the virus to others
1091911 hospitals like grady and jackson are doing the best they can in the face of a persistent problem with limited resources

1091913 dietary intake and nutritional education dine for latino migrant farmworkers
1091914 migrant workers have a low level of food security that is the lack of well balanced food choices readily available at all times to maintain a healthy life
1091915 this can happen seasonally when agricultural work ends or when money runs out at the end of the month
1091916 consensus is emerging that an 18 year old is not the same person she or he will be at 25 just as an 11 year old is not the same as he or she will be at 18 they dont look the same feel the same think the same or act the same
1091917 im hearing from a lot of people in their 20s because they are feeling huge pressure to get it all together and make their mark
1091918 and thats really unfair theres an enormous amount that happens after 25 or after 30 or after 40 some of which cant happen any earlier
1091919 the kind of milestones that we have associated with adulthood are happening later in the 20s
1091920 in our current incredibly complex global society some of the changes that happen in young adulthood may prove to be crucial
1091921 this study is one step towards a greater insight into the relationship between oily substances and water at the molecular level an area of fundamental science which is relatively little understood but which has enormous potential for industry medicine and nanotechnology
1091922 it was very interesting to see that our results suggest there is no tiny gap between oil and water when they meet despite having a reputation for not liking each other it seems the opposite is true they may not be able to mix but they come into full contact with each other at a strong interface perhaps they like each other more than we previously thought
1091923 but they shouldnt have destroyed my house forcibly evicted me and left me homeless
1091924 the significance of this is for other groups of patients with neurological impairment
1091925 do all of these patients have the same mechanism for reflux and swallowing disorders if not performing a fundoplication anti reflux surgery may not help in fact it may make things worse like it did in the rett girls
1091926 this issue is of particular interest to pediatricians who refer these patients for their reflux problems
1091927 if we develop a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the problems being experienced by these children we just might be able to find a way to make life a little more comfortable for them
1091928 wimax is the cheapest channel to do this and it is the channel that can deliver the best quality of service

1091930 the orbit of steins with which rosetta will rendezvous on 5 september closing to a distance of 800 km is only known thanks to ground observations but not yet with the accuracy we would like for the close fly by
1091931 for the first three weeks of the campaign however only the powerful eyes of osiris will actually be able to spot the asteroid which will look only like a dot in the sky
1091932 starting 11 days before closest approach as the distance with steins decreases the two rosetta navigation cameras will finally be able to see and track the asteroid too
1091933 we will already be able to use the first data set for the trajectory correction manoeuvre planned for mid august
1091934 as rosettas distance from steins decreases the precision of the measurements for steins orbit will increase even further allowing us the best possible trajectory corrections later on before closest approach especially in early september
1091935 but osiris will also take this opportunity to obtain light curves of steins light curves tell us how the asteroid brightness varies with time providing us with additional preparatory information about the asteroid such as better knowledge of its shape and rotation characteristics
1091936 young women should be made aware of the costs associated with attractiveness and it should be made clear that although sexy clothing and promises of sexual access may be means of attracting desired males they may also attract undesired ones
1091937 humans have evolved from animals that walked on all fours when the bottom was a big turn on to males who would mate from behind
1091938 are the two most accessible concentrations of scent glands on the human body besides the ears
1091939 asked to rate each mans shirt for sexiness pleasantness and intensity of smell
1091940 couples experiencing difficulty conceiving a child even after several attempts at tubal embryo transfer share significantly more of their mhc than do couples who conceive more easily
1091941 homosexuality has been observed among 1 500 species and homosexuality is a common and widespread phenomenon in the animal world not only short lived sexual relationships but even long lasting partnerships partnerships that may last a lifetime
1091942 homosexuality is a major puzzle for evolutionary theory for if evolution has a purpose it is reproductive fitness the passing of genes to our children
1091943 homosexuality may be partly influenced by genetics as hahn indictes the same genes that are proposed to predispose to homosexuality in men may also boost reproduction in women
1091944 reporting on 144 studies of sexual orientation published in the journal of homosexuality from 1974 to 1993 found that only 10 percent of these studies used a multidimensional scale to assess homosexuality

1092012 i came here at carlisles request as the others to witness
1092013 that is certainly no longer necessary with regard to the child we all see what she is
1092014 two of you i know makenna charles and i can see that many of you others are also wanderers roamers like myself answering to none think carefully on what i tell you now
1092015 these ancient ones did not come here for justice as they told you we suspected as much and now it has been proved witness now as they seek flimsy excuses to continue their true mission witness them struggle to find a justification for their true purpose to destroy this family here
1092016 the volturi come to erase what they perceive as the competition perhaps like me you look at this clans golden eyes and marvel they are difficult to understand its true but the ancient ones look and see something besides their strange choice they see
1092017 i have witnessed these bonds within this family i say family and not coven these strange golden eyed ones deny their very natures but in return have they found something worth even more perhaps than mere gratification of desire ive made a little study of them in my time here and it seems to me that intrinsic to this intense family binding that which makes them possible at all is the peaceful character of this life of sacrifice there is no aggression here like we all saw in the large southern clans that grew and diminished so quickly in their wild feuds there is no thought for domination and aro knows this better than i do
1092018 carlisle assured us all when he told us what was coming that he did not call us here to fight these witnesses
1092019 agreed to give evidence to slow the volturi advance with their presence so that carlisle would get the chance to present his case
1092020 if carlisle having truth on his side would be enough to stop the so called justice
1092021 we have the answer to all these questions we heard it in aros lying words we have one with a gift of knowing such things for certain and we see it now in caiuss eager smile their guard is just a mindless weapon a tool in their masters quest for domination
1092022 i came to witness i stay to fight the volturi care nothing for the death of the child they seek the death of our free will
1092023 so come i say lets hear no more lying rationalizations be honest in your intents as we will be honest in ours we will defend out freedom you will or will not attack it choose now and let these witnesses see the true issue debated here
1092024 you might consider joining us if you think the volturi will let you live to tell this take you are mistaken we may all be destroyed
1092025 but then again maybe not perhaps we are on more equal footing than they know perhaps the volturi have finally met their match i promise you this though if we fall so do you

1092062 why do you always have to do things the hard way
1092063 on this wonderful day when we are gathered together to celebrate your academic success i have decided to talk to you about the benefits of failure and as you stand on the threshold of what is sometimes called real life i want to extol the crucial importance of imagination
1092064 looking back at the 21 year old that i was at graduation is a slightly uncomfortable experience for the 42 year old that she has become half my lifetime ago i was striking an uneasy balance between the ambition i had for myself and what those closest to me expected of me i was convinced that the only thing i wanted to do ever was to write novels however my parents both of whom came from impoverished backgrounds and neither of whom had been to college took the view that my overactive imagination was an amusing personal quirk that could never pay a mortgage or secure a pension
1092065 youre going to do something you really regret one day because you cant stop daydreaming
1092066 i would like to make it clear in parenthesis that i do not blame my parents for their point of view there is an expiry date on blaming your parents for steering you in the wrong direction the moment you are old enough to take the wheel responsibility lies with you what is more i cannot criticise my parents for hoping that i would never experience poverty they had been poor themselves and i have since been poor and i quite agree with them that it is not an ennobling experience poverty entails fear and stress and sometimes depression it means a thousand petty humiliations and hardships climbing out of poverty by your own efforts that is indeed something on which to pride yourself but poverty itself is romanticised only by fools
1092067 what i feared most for myself at your age was not poverty but failure at your age in spite of a distinct lack of motivation at university where i had spent far too long in the coffee bar writing stories and far too little time at lectures i had a knack for passing examinations and that for years had been the measure of success in my life and that of my peers
1092068 i am not dull enough to suppose that because you are young gifted and well educated you have never known hardship or heartbreak talent and intelligence never yet inoculated anyone against the caprice of the fates and i do not for a moment suppose that everyone here has enjoyed an existence of unruffled privilege and contentment however the fact that you are graduating from harvard suggests that you are not very well acquainted with failure you might be driven by a fear of failure quite as much as a desire for success indeed your conception of failure might not be too far from the average persons idea of success so high have you already flown academically ultimately we all have to decide for ourselves what constitutes failure but the world is quite eager to give you a set of criteria if you let it so i think it fair to say that by any conventional measure a mere seven years after my graduation day i had failed on an epic scale an exceptionally short lived marriage had imploded and i was jobless a lone parent and as poor as it is possible to be in modern britain without being homeless the fears my parents had had for me and that i had had for myself had both come to pass and by every usual standard i was the biggest failure i knew
1092069 now i am not going to stand here and tell you that failure is fun that period of my life was a dark one and i had no idea that there was going to be what the press has since represented as a kind of fairy tale resolution i had no idea how far the tunnel extended and for a long time any light at the end of it was a hope rather than a reality so why do i talk about the benefits of failure simply because failure meant a stripping away of the inessential i stopped pretending to myself that i was anything other than what i was and began to direct all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me had i really succeeded at anything else i might never have found the determination to succeed in the one arena i believed i truly belonged i was set free because my greatest fear had already been realised and i was still alive and i still had a daughter whom i adored and i had an old typewriter and a big idea and so rock bottom became the solid foundation on which i rebuilt my life you might never fail on the scale i did but some failure in life is inevitable it is impossible to live without failing at something unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all in which case you fail by default

1092083 israel decided to take the humanitarian decision to transfer to jericho 87 residents of the shujaiya neighbourhood in gaza because of the violence carried out by hamas
1092084 we talked with them on the bus and we told them that jericho and the west bank are different from the gaza strip and that the israeli army controls this region they have to respect the law
1092085 are mainly young people aged between 14 and 20 years who will remain in jericho indefinitely their families will not be allowed to join them
1092086 received information that they were being arrested by hamas and that their lives were in immediate danger
1092087 we never wanted anyone to leave in this regrettable way
1092088 this is a path that does harm to them because by the mere act of fleeing a person places himself in the realm of suspicion
1092089 we condemn the criminal acts undertaken by the hamas leadership against the palestinian people in shujaiya in gaza
1092090 these criminal acts have forced a number of people to flee to israel including women and children and so president abbas has called on a number of parties to rescue those who are in danger from the hamas militia
1092091 this is the first book i have read by this author and i must say i read the book in two days it was very well written and the characters had substance i also liked the fact that the stories were based on older more mature characters i would recommend this book to others
1092092 this book was very slow it was very difficult for me to get involved in the storyline i would not recommend

1092097 our state is enacting educational policy not based on consideration for what is the best most effective way of teaching kids

1092110 no matter how sophisticated you make these automated systems youre not going to make them perfect and all you can really strive for is to tune them as you go along
1092111 its pretty clear there was a lapse in terms of the quality control of yahoos keyword list
1092112 leverages a combination of algorithmic and editorial processes to identify current relevant and popular terms
1092113 we are really only in the infancy of this kind of automated analysis
1092114 im sure its going to be expanding greatly not just in volume but in sophistication
1092115 the quality of the content and the information is paramount
1092116 you want to make sure youre striking the right balance between giving your readers everything the web has to offer with making sure theyre getting the right information and the relevant information
1092117 we just put her to sleep i dont know why she is wailing again

1092123 thanks wise guy why dont you hold her for a while

1092134 the actual person teaching makes a difference in how students learn when there is a good relationship that really facilitates learning and motivation and we found that in almost every area the regular classroom teachers were more effective they were better
1092135 the relationship between the teacher and the student particularly during adolescence is very important it was easier for the kids to talk about personal stuff with someone they knew it was easier for them to absorb the material and become more interested in what they were talking about with their regular teacher in the classroom
1092136 when you have kids who simply memorize material for the test and two weeks later dont remember any of it youre not getting anywhere but if you can get the kids to care and learn because they think its important thats something that will last a lifetime
1092137 students who had a sexual partner were more likely to say that there was class discussion going on with the regular teacher than those taught by the outside person these kids were more likely to feel like there was discussion of these issues rather than just the teacher lecturing to them
1092138 school is the absolute best way to get information out to adolescents no matter who is teaching the important thing is getting the teacher to make a connection if the teacher can make the right connection with one kid youve saved one person from getting hiv youve saved one persons life

1092141 given concerns about potential harmful effects and lack of evidence proving that these medications are effective in young children the fact that one in ten u s children is using one of these medications is striking
1092142 job growth matters but only if you could get it where jobs are needed the most we found that jobs had a bigger impact on reducing poverty in smaller metropolitan areas because if you live in a small area you can get to where the jobs are but if you live in columbus or cleveland or new york or atlanta it is going to be harder to get to the jobs
1092143 many lower skilled workers are single mothers with children who dont have reliable transportation their kids get sick so they miss a couple of days of work and then they get fired so finding ways of breaking down this kind of barrier so they can work can really make a difference
1092144 you tend to find out about jobs from your friends coworkers and neighbors but if you live in an area that is downtown and the jobs are being created out in the suburbs it will be more difficult to find out what jobs are available

1092146 when we first prescribed highly active antiretroviral therapy for hiv in 1995 we were concerned about how these drugs changed lipid levels in patients and whether they would increase atherosclerosis and ultimately lead to serious heart disease
1092147 while some studies have found an association between these antiretroviral treatments and increased risk of cardiovascular disease we believe our findings should reassure clinicians that using antiretroviral therapy over time does not appear to put patients at greater risk for coronary atherosclerosis and may in fact be more beneficial than we had initially thought
1092148 this was not surprising since these are the major risk factors for atherosclerosis in the general population
1092149 the purpose of our study however was to investigate whether long term haart usage was a major risk factor
1092150 these results could be due in part to lower lipid values of hiv infected men prior to beginning antiretroviral therapy and high use of lipid lowering drugs the key is that controlling risk factors for atherosclerosis should be a priority
1092151 what remains to be determined is whether use of the newest antiretroviral therapies confers an even better outcome and whether lipid lowering therapies will further improve cardiovascular risk in the hiv infected population our future research will address these questions
1092152 the first neutrons met all of our technical performance predictions and creating them is a significant milestone in the life of the facility and in the completion of the project
1092153 the isis second target station builds on the success and expertise we have developed over the past 20 years at isis and allows us to move further into the areas of soft matter advanced materials and bioscience we will be carrying out fundamental research that will shape the technological advances of tomorrow
1092154 this is an incredible technical achievement by our staff and demonstrates how everyone can pull together and enable stfc to deliver massive science projects that underpin the long term future of science and innovation in the uk
1092155 im very proud of every single person who has played a part in getting the isis second target station project through to this very important milestone
1092156 this is tremendous news for the science community both in the uk and much further afield
1092157 the isis second target station will open research into new types of materials that has not been previously possible at isis and we look forward to a world of new science flowing from the new instrument suite
1092158 this is a remarkable achievement by the isis team and adds an exciting new dimension to the capabilities of the european neutron scattering toolkit
1092159 isis is the worlds leading spallation neutron facility and has performed world class outstanding science
1092160 adding the second target station is the next great step for isis to enhance the ability and extend the reputation of neutron sciences world wide
1092161 together with the great scientific environment at isis the skilful design and the mature know how in neutron technology applied on the second target station will open up unexplored areas for pulsed cold neutron experiments isis can stay as the world leader even as more powerful spallation neutron sources such as j parc and the us spallation neutron source come online

1092303 is it hot water or soap that they cant afford
1092304 thanks for coming out julie is pretty upset about her cat
1092305 let me just take a look at your sweet girl alright
1092306 when we spoke on the phone you said that shed had one dead kitten a few days ago and hadnt eaten since then right
1092307 she is dehydrated for one thing which means she doesnt have enough water in her body
1092308 well theres a lot going on here i can feel kittens in her belly still and i can smell that they are rotting
1092309 and shes yellow which i already told you could be a problem with her liver or it could be a problem with her blood
1092310 her heart sounds strong but she has a murmur instead of going lub dub it goes lush dub that might just be because of not having enough water in her body but it could be something wrong with her blood or her heart too
1092311 so she for sure has dead rotting kittens in her and is dehydrated plus she may have problems with her heart liver and blood
1092312 the biggest problem is that one thing that could cause all of that is a viral infection that is contagious to other cats deadly and for which we have no cure
1092313 the first thing id like to do is collect some blood to test for two viruses that will kill her no matter what we do i can run the tests here and have an answer in about 15 minutes while were waiting ill start an iv to treat the dehydration and get her a bit more comfortable
1092314 if either test is positive the kindest thing will be to put her to sleep
1092315 ill draw enough blood the first time to run some other blood work ill look at her liver and kidney values do a blood cell count and look at a slide to see whats going on there and well talk about prognosis and costs im doing all i can at this point to keep costs to a minimum
1092316 we may end up deciding that the risk is too great to justify the expense euthanasia is always an option
1092317 i understand what youre saying they dont have a lot of money but this cat is important to julie its her best friend
1092318 ill take her in back to the get the blood and start the iv then bring her back in to you while i start the tests okay
1092319 im going to go look at the blood smear i made ill be back in a bit with some answers for you just stick your head out this door and holler for me if you need anything okay
1092320 she doesnt have either of the deadly viruses i was worried about her blood looks good and her body is definitely fighting her kidney values are up but that might just be from being dehydrated her liver is a mess if we dont do anything she will die for sure
1092321 if i do surgery and take the dead kittens out like we discussed on the phone she might live but its expensive and she might still die afterwards she might not even live through the surgery shes pretty sick
1092322 its my fault shes so sick i shoulda called as soon as she had that dead kitten i dont care if it costs a lot we gotta try
1092323 do it whatever it takes do it and well just have to hope it works
1092324 well shes not out of the woods yet itll take a day or two to know whether or not her liver will recover but if she starts eating chances are shell be fine
1092325 you are the best doctor ive ever seen thank you for saving suzie i love that cat so much
1092326 i was gonna get a car but suzies more important count it please i need to know if i got it right
1092327 thank you both for loving her so much for helping me tonight and for giving me this which keeps me out of trouble

1092364 ya son muchos los ayuntamientos y ciudadanos qu est n empezando a utilizar energ as limpias
1092365 la administraci n valenciana tambi n debe dar ejemplo no con actuaciones puntuales sino de manera integral
1092366 lucha contra el cambio clim tico es cosa de todos y todas pero sobre todo de las administraciones p blicas que deben ser ejemplo de medidas concretas que ayudan a un cambio por un modelo de desarrollo sostenible y respetuoso el cambio de modelo energ tico es por lo tanto una de las medidas que desde el consell se puede impulsar de manera eficaz
1092367 y aunque han habido pronunciamientos favorables un nimes despu s nunca se han visto reflejadas en ninguna realidad concreta
1092368 es urgente trabajar en la extensi n del cambio clim tico disminuyendo las emisiones de co2
1092369 esta tarea es una responsabilidad sobre todo de los gobiernos que han de aplicar pol ticas de contenci n de la demanda por reducir el consumo energ tico de nuestra sociedad de promoci n del ahorro y de la eficiencia energ tica y de reducci n de la dependencia de los combustibles f siles por utilizar las energ as renovables
1092370 se contradice con la percepci n negativa que tienen los usuarios de la calidad del agua de las costas de la comunitat por lo que espera disponer en septiembre del resultado de las anal ticas efectuadas a los largo largo de estos ltimos meses incluidos los meses de verano y poder comprobar directamente las condiciones en qu estas se realizan y los resultados de las mismas
1092371 la constataci n directa que tenemos los ciudadanos que pasamos nuestras vacaciones en nuestras playas es que del dicho al hecho hay mucho trecho y que nuestras aguas est n m s contaminadas
1092372 las valoraciones que hacen organizaciones como ecologistas en acci n o greenpeace o las anal ticas que hacen las universidades contradice las declaraciones del conseller
1092373 se nos venden como muestra de la calidad de las aguas de ba o las banderas azules otorgadas por una fundaci n a la que la uni n europea ha retirado las ayudas econ micas por las miles denuncias por fraude existentes
1092374 otorga alegremente banderas por las infraestructuras que se ofrecen y no por la calidad de las playas
1092375 la realidad es que en les playas valencianas cada d a se encuentran m s residuos lo suficiente a a menudo abocados por barcos o f bricas sin ning n control algas o pescados y aves muertas y los ayuntamientos en el mejor de los casos se gasten cada a o m s dinero en limpieza y esto si es un buen indicador de la mala calidad de nuestras aguas
1092376 los informes alternativos demuestran que la costa mediterr nea es la m s desnaturalizada de las costas espa olas la que tiene un mayor grado de erosi n y degradaci n del los ecosistemas de la plataforma y la m s contaminada por el hecho que no se depuran lo suficiente sus aguas
1092377 la destrucci n y la presi n sobre h bitats estrat gicos para la conservaci n de la pesca es demasiado frecuente en el mediterr neo puesto que la degradaci n de humedales y prader as submarinas provoca impactos insostenibles para a la econom a pesquera urban stica y tur stica a plazo mediano

1092387 es una de la soluciones que la generalitat teniendo como prioridad la atenci n de las personas mayores y de sus familias y sensible ante este problema ha buscado como apoyo a los cuidadores de forma que la atenci n a sus familiares no implique necesariamente un desgaste f sico y emocional que impida el propio bienestar de la persona cuidadora

1092395 este proyecto tiene como intenci n fundamental conseguir un espacio que recupere la fisonom a del antiguo paseo de coches reservando una plataforma de 7 metros de anchura para el uso exclusivo del tram y disponiendo a ambos lados de dicha plataforma de sendos paseos peatonales que dentro del proyecto de plataformas reservadas al transporte p blico de castell n conecta la uji con el centro de la ciudad constituy ndose como un gran eje peatonal y c vico para la ciudad
1092396 el espacio resultante tendr tambi n una serie de servicios como kioscos y un nuevo mobiliario urbano dirigido a la comodidad y a recuperar este espacio tan emblem tico de castell n
1092397 la principal preocupaci n del equipo de gobierno era evitar cualquier tipo de afecci n al parque y con esta actuaci n no s lo se cuenta con el transporte m s moderno y ecol gico de europa sino que el entorno y el concepto urbano de este pulm n verde se ve sustancialmente mejorado
1092398 con el fin de evitar molestias a los peatones y as garantizar una total permeabilidad que permita que los ciudadanos puedan seguir disfrutando del resto del parque

1092601 leading scientists in china are constantly finding ways to create more effective ips cells through this forum we agreed to help verify each others work share experiences and ensure safe high standard research takes place so that we may someday create the conditions for effective clinical treatments and industrial scale production of ips cells while no one knows yet when these conditions might be met this forum certainly helped speed up the process by bringing together some of the worlds best minds working towards these goals

1092621 they were alongside the cannon in front of central and used to be painted with denfeld colors periodically amp there must be an old timer at duluth spring whod know more about what happened to the cannon just think this is only 50 years ago and books of the new testament were written decades to hundreds of years after the fact and are accepted without question
1092622 sander peterson who owned the twig store many many years ago wanted to move a post office there but they didnt have any name they wanted to call it branch but there already was a north branch in minnesota so twig was suggested and thats what its been ever since and pretty near as i know thats the gospel truth
1092623 limb didnt sound very good so they settled on twig
1092624 it was the last name the farmers thought would be chosen but post office officials apparently thought the name suited the small rural settlement
1092625 the u s postal service indicated that it had to be a branch of the duluth post office and the name must be limited to 4 letters therefore they thought of the name twig

1092653 our goal is to create a situation where should steve decide to run there will be a grass roots and finance organization already in place to secure him the republican nomination
1092654 steve lonegans conservative leadership is the reason he is the republican partys premier leader when so many other leaders have been asleep at the wheel
1092655 no one in new jersey has the record of accomplishment steve lonegan has built from stopping mcgreeveys gasoline tax hike to defeating two ballot questions last november and the corzine borrowing and toll hike scheme last spring
1092656 new jersey republicans continue to lose election after election because we run the same old gang of weak kneed wimpy moderates who believe in nothing and are afraid to throw a punch
1092657 he knows how to play the game neither the democrats nor corzines money intimidates him to steve defeat is not an option and that resonates with the millions of overtaxed new jersey voters ready to give up on our state but ready to give our state one more chance
1092658 as well as a direct mail fundraising appeal to people who have supported steve and other conservatives in the past
1092659 he shall be great in the sight of the lord and he shall be filled with the holy ghost

1092683 its beyond the time that we change the business as usual in harrisburg he told reporters today
1092684 if these bonusgate allegations are true our state government is broken
1092685 occurred on his watch and even though mr deweese claims he knew nothing about them he was still the leader when the bonuses were allegedly given out for political work in 2006
1092686 we need a break from the past we must enact real change for the people of pennsylvania
1092687 bill deweese doesnt have the publics trust and we need leaders that do have that trust
1092688 he has become a lightning rod for controversy said mr taylor who is at least the seventh democrat to urge mr deweese to step down from leadership

1092693 ive been at this for 22 years its about as bad as i have seen it in the fixed income market during that period what we have been seeing over the last eight weeks has been pretty extreme

1092695 this has been a very deep and unusual crisis that involves the unwinding of a decade of excess
1092696 it is pretty clear that retail deposit taking institutions are in a stronger position i think the business model will change significantly and there will be fewer independent investment banks
1092697 stand alone investment banks will struggle to operate in anything like the way they were before the crisis
1092698 they are not going to be able to operate with the same degree of flexibility and leverage
1092699 investment banks have shown an amazing ability to reinvent themselves
1092700 investment banks should have a deep interest in making the fed comfortable they will not want it to escalate late launch emergency action in response to a funding crisis
1092701 a government back stop would reduce the risks of the business but it could also take away some of the profit potential

1092721 we contacted law enforcement and told them we believe we know his whereabouts on a personal level i can only describe this development as surreal and emotional
1092722 at his request we also provided him temporary access to our offices so he could use the internet to facilitate his relocation efforts
1092723 if there is one silver lining and this means a lot to me as a new mother it is that our real estate agents did the right thing and did it quickly to return a young child safely to her mother
1092724 all this was possible because i could catch rain here
1092725 in this area of heavy rainfall you might strike water in an open well

1092756 look around you this is not a country where people cower in fear
1092757 everyone has settled in straight away because weve got such a strong core of players
1092758 they make it very easy for anyone who comes in from outside
1092759 after two weeks they look like theyve been here for a long time
1092760 its about having a strong squad to compete in the championship and thats what we are working towards
1092761 football makes the decision on who gets picked each week its not down to me
1092762 they need to work hard throughout the next 10 months
1092763 you need performances and the performances will bring you the results
1092764 our dressing room is a special place to work and that will carry on
1092765 in a dispute about race the mccain campaign knows it will end up with the larger half
1092766 for the most part most white peoples experience with race isnt one of racial discrimination they can only relate to racial discrimination in the abstract what white people can relate to is the fear of being unjustly accused of racism this is the larger half this is why allegations of racism often provoke more outrage than actual racism because most of the country can relate to one the accusation of racism easier than the other actual racism for this reason in a political conflict over race the mccain campaign has the advantage because saying the race card has been played is actually the ultimate race card
1092767 the two protagonists were clearly identified on the cctv as being horwood and anderson
1092768 the cctv showed horwood enter the carriage and attempt to conceal himself by pulling on his hooded top while anderson was caught nodding towards the direction of the onboard cameras almost as if he was aware he was being filmed
1092769 horwood and anderson then began attacking the victim while the other two males looked on
1092770 the victim suffered a prolonged and vicious attack involving some 12 punches and seven kicks mostly towards the head and upper body
1092771 horwood grabs the bag and then attempts to escape via the adjacent carriage when the train pulls into branksome
1092772 we have brought in quite a few new players and they have responded well
1092773 we have still got to put the final pieces together
1092774 overall weve had a good month or so and changed quite a few things around
1092775 we are getting very close to getting stuck into what will be a very difficult campaign for us
1092776 by the end of august we will know the league inside out and hopefully that will be a good thing
1092777 weve got to have a decent august to make it all worthwhile and to get all of our fans on board because we are not complete without our fans on side
1092778 for that to be complete we have to win football matches
1092779 even though most grocery store plums are closer to mushy than juicy i still instantly think of plums when i hear the word juicy
1092780 maybe its because ive eaten so many amazing plums over the past few years while researching a book about them
1092781 i think of apples its the sensation of juice dripping down your chin and an explosion of sweet flavor with the first bite

1092847 the significance of this is for other groups of patients with neurological impairment
1092848 do all of these patients have the same mechanism for reflux and swallowing disorders if not performing a fundoplication anti reflux surgery may not help in fact it may make things worse like it did in the rett girls
1092849 this issue is of particular interest to pediatricians who refer these patients for their reflux problems
1092850 if we develop a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the problems being experienced by these children we just might be able to find a way to make life a little more comfortable for them
1092851 if all incompatible donors and recipients were simply listed in one common pool the problems related to incompatible and poorly matched donors and recipients would be a thing of the past
1092852 newyork presbyterian weill cornell introduced the registry to ucla a few months ago prompting ucla to join the innovative program
1092853 this is a rare instance of a living donor kidney being shipped across the country to initiate a chain
1092854 if we can become comfortable shipping living donor kidneys like we do with deceased donor kidneys then thousands of patients will have the opportunity to receive a kidney who otherwise would have been forced to remain on dialysis
1092855 the hope is that this marks the first of many such collaborations among the nations transplant centers
1092856 donor chains have enormous potential to expand the donor pool and to provide better matched organs for the many individuals who are in desperate need of lifesaving transplants
1092857 kidney donor chains could have a significant impact on the countrys organ donor shortage
1092858 whereas the chain involves an extra donor in the beginning so you can initiate a self propagating cascade
1092859 but in this case ucla received a live donor kidney from new york which hasnt been done before
1092860 living donor exchange represents the pinnacle of teamwork and professional and personal trust and good faith that ideally epitomizes the organ transplant endeavor
1092861 the team consists of surgeons physicians nurses coordinators patients and donors all working together toward the same goal
1092862 patients can wait up to eight years for a deceased donor transplant
1092863 this donor chain may enable hundreds of patients to receive a kidney thanks to one generous altruistic donor rather than in the past where only one patient benefited from an altruistic donor this could significantly decrease the waiting list for kidney transplantation
1092864 i have had the incredibly sad experience of having a colleague die while waiting for a kidney transplant
1092865 i have a close friend who donated a kidney to her brother and i have a close friend who received a kidney more than a decade ago and i see the terrific experiences shes had since
1092866 when i started thinking about it i thought im able and healthy at this point in my life to do this to help someone have more years of a better life why not donate the beauty of this partnership between excellent doctors transplant coordinators and staff at newyork presbyterian weill cornell ucla and a group of seven people a partnership connecting both coasts is that a chain of people have better lives and the chain goes on
1092867 if we can get this exchange program going its going to be the answer to lots of peoples situations
1092868 this is going to help so many people down the line
1092869 pam couldnt sit on the transplant wait list for several years something needed to be done im glad i could do my part to help
1092870 everyone would benefit if more donated today its me tomorrow its someone else
1092871 it was like a closed door that is now being opened again
1092872 randy and i talked about it and we said ok hes willing to give to somebody else and i wont have to take as many medications after the surgery
1092873 the epidemic growth of type 2 diabetes has created a race against time to find new approaches to treat and understand the disease diabetes surgery and other novel interventional techniques are not only a promising therapeutic option for selected patients with type 2 diabetes but also an unprecedented opportunity to shed light on the origin of the disease to ensure a timely scientific and safe development of this emerging discipline it is necessary to balance enthusiasm with caution this is possible only with the immediate attention and responsible urgent actions from the global diabetes community
1092874 implementation of widely accepted international recommendations to avoid an inappropriate use of surgery and ensure respect of safety standards has become top priority
1092875 while these procedures may be life saving less than 2 percent of those patients already eligible under current nih recommendations are offered a surgical option in the u s
1092876 this may be because of limited awareness among primary care physicians surgeons and diabetes specialists and insufficient insurance coverage
1092877 it is very timely and appropriate that major scientific organizations start to carefully evaluate available evidence and to encourage initiatives such as the world congress that promote a rigorous multidisciplinary approach to this field
1092878 there are opportunities and risks that cannot be ignored and both need to be adequately addressed
1092879 the insights already beginning to be gained by studying surgical interventions may be the most profound since the discovery of insulin
1092880 surgery has arrived like a comet across the firmament of diabetes and obesity unexpected brilliant with great promise for the future teams of talented researchers are moving ahead to define the role of surgery in the treatment of both of these scourges
1092881 diabetes is growing at epidemic rates worldwide and places a severe burden on the economy and society
1092882 however issues may be very different in developed versus developing regions of the world organizing a world congress to discuss the potential role of an emerging and yet controversial approach to diabetes is very appropriate and there are both global and regional perspectives that must be considered

1092887 once again center for computer forensics is proving that electronic evidence issues arise in a wide array of cases recently ccf participated in a case where a construction company was alleged to have negligently disrupted electrical service during a building project the plaintiff a nearby manufacturer sought damages on the theory that the disruption destroyed computer data and caused a loss in profits after being retained by defense counsel ccf experts determined that 1 the plaintiff not the defendant permanently purged all of the computer files in question after the initiation of the lawsuit and 2 due to an obscure protocol the backup tapes the plaintiff produced during discovery had never been used and thus could not have been copies of the plaintiffs computer drives as a result of ccfs irrefutable expert findings the court concluded that the plaintiff intentionally attempted to destroy evidence dismissed the case and awarded the defendant costs and attorneys fees incurred in the defense of the lawsuit
1092888 the plaintiff filed a motion for a temporary injunction to enjoin the defendant from using trade secrets that the plaintiff believed the defendant had misappropriated
1092889 at that time the disciples came to jesus and asked who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven he called a little child and had him stand among them and he said i tell you the truth unless you change and become like little children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven therefore whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven

1092891 hes the first to propose a budget that tops 3 trillion only six years ago he was the first to propose one that topped 2 trillion america is the proud owner of the largest government on earth
1092892 in some cases the federal government imposes new rules and regulations on lower governments and those governments must raise taxes to cover the cost of compliance
1092893 and complying with regulations costs private sector organizations big money too they pass the costs along to us through increases in the price of consumer goods
1092894 so regulations end up costing us hard money just as taxes do
1092895 precisely crews report calculates that regulatory compliance costs hit 1 16 trillion in 2007 an amount almost half the size of the federal budget itself federal regulations gobbled up nearly 10 percent of what the u s economy produced last year
1092896 in 2007 nearly 3 600 new rules and regulations were added since 1995 when the small government republicans took over congress 51 000 rules and regulations have been added
1092897 the federal register which contains all the rules and regulations is more than 72 000 pages thick down a touch from previous years but still massive nonetheless
1092898 it all starts with lawmaking in response to a social or economic need or problem congress passes a law the appropriate regulatory agency then interprets that law and writes regulations that define how the law will be implemented
1092899 the fda creates its regulations under the authority of the food drug and cosmetics act the controlled substances act and several other acts created by congress over the years based on the acts the fda creates specific regulations that determine what food and drug companies can and cannot do
1092900 do you mean government bureaucrats not elected officials are really the ones determining what people and organizations can and cannot do
1092901 yep there are more than 50 regulatory agencies in the federal government and each is empowered to create and enforce rules and regulations that are backed by the might of federal law individuals and organizations can be fined or thrown in jail for violating them
1092902 it can be ominous which is why regulators must be kept in check but where regulations are concerned crews says nobody is doing that
1092903 disclosure and accountability crews argues that regulatory costs should be accounted for just like federal spending cost benefit analysis should be provided before a regulation is imposed and when a regulation will cost more than 100 million to comply with the congress should be required to vote on the regulation before it becomes binding
1092904 he also argues that congress should create a regulatory report card to monitor regulatory agencies
1092905 that crews fellow has some really good ideas but isnt he overlooking the primary benefit of an incredibly thick federal register

1092983 peter was my best friend and he was really into cb i became involved too later when peter decided to take an amateur radio licensing class it was natural that id go along with my buddy and take the class too

1093003 ayah tunggu kau di sini jam 5 sore lalu kita akan pulang ke rumah bersama sama
1093004 ada sesuatu yang salah dalam membesarkan engkau sehingga engkau tidak memiliki keberanian untuk menceritakan kebenaran pada ayah untuk menghukum kesalahan ayah ini biarkanlah ayah pulang berjalan kaki sepanjang 18 mil dan memikirkannya baik baik
1093005 of course people were afraid to fill out the petition because they were worried about being picked up by the security services and beaten
1093006 but when we explained to them that this was necessary for the republic in most cases they signed the petition
1093007 aushev is a hero of the soviet union not by his words but by his deeds
1093008 theres an intricate pattern in which this accused helped in the preparation of and transportation of the leadership that made this possible
1093009 not one witness said he had any role in the terrorist attacks themselves
1093010 you must decide the weight and significance if any such statements deserve
1093011 they filled her prescription with the wrong strength and they never diagnosed the meningitis even though she had been complaining about headaches sweats and generalized pain for weeks that is what killed her in the end
1093012 it was so advanced that it involved her brain her liver her lungs her heart and a couple of other organs she died in terrible pain
1093013 i told them i needed my medicine but they didnt give me anything
1093014 she told me after a month in detention that she still hadnt seen a doctor
1093015 i told her i could send her more medicine but she said they would not give it to her they were mostly giving her tylenol
1093016 he told me that victoria wasnt eating and was urinating blood but that the officials still were not paying her any mind
1093017 he told me get outside help but try not to worry
1093018 her foot was chained to the bed and when she tried to turn over it would hurt her
1093019 that made it twice as hard it was so humiliating no human should have to live their last days like that
1093020 the secretary of state said on friday the edf deal would have been a good fit
1093021 that remains our view and the parties are still in discussions

1093025 he was one of the first people who spoke up about the inhumanity of stalins regime with a full voice and about the people who lived through this but were not broken
1093026 its a great loss for our family its also a loss for the country
1093027 he was always really happy he returned this is his home
1093028 we are happy with this development as this will allow us to know what is really being agreed upon by the two panels because the agreement is not clear to us

1093043 when foxes run in the place where only the high priest could enter on yom kippur shouldnt we cry
1093044 i know two prophesies the first of the prophet micah saying because of you zion will be a plowed field jerusalem a ruin and the temple mount a forest the second of zechariah saying old men and women will yet rejoice in the streets of jerusalem until i saw the first prophesy fulfilled i feared the second would never happen now that i have seen the first prophesy come true i know the second will also
1093045 akiva you have comforted us akiva you have comforted us
1093046 they will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks nation will not take up sword against nation nor will they train for war anymore
1093047 we will do some preventive actions and use the appropriate amount of force if necessary we will not wait for them to shoot at us
1093048 police have recorded at least 130 attacks in different establishments and installations in davao region
1093049 most of the attacks were carried out by the npa
1093050 lately the attacks have become frequent thus prompting the pnp leadership to deploy saf to the area
1093051 the parties agree that the bje shall be empowered to build develop and maintain its own institutions inclusive of civil service electoral financial and banking education legislation legal economic and police and internal security force judicial system and correctional institutions necessary for developing a progressive bangsamoro society the details of which shall be discussed in the negotiation of the comprehensive compact
1093052 without prejudice to the right of the bangsamoro juridical entity to enter into agreement and environmental cooperation with any friendly country affecting its jurisdiction it shall include the option to establish and open bangsamoro trade missions in foreign countries with which it has economic cooperation agreements and the elements bearing in mind the mutual benefits derived from philippine archipelagic status and security
1093053 take necessary steps to ensure the bjes participation in international meetings and events such as the association of southeast asian nations and other specialized agencies of the united nations
1093054 this shall entitle the bjes participation in philippine official missions and delegations that are engaged in the negotiation of border agreements and protocols for environmental protection equitable sharing of incomes and revenues in the areas of sea seabed and inland seas or bodies of water adjacent to or between islands forming part of the ancestral domain in addition to those of fishing rights
1093055 the company has refused to conduct an initial public offering of at least 10 percent of its shares the firm has refused to list its shares in the local stock exchange despite the definite mandate of the law
1093056 investigate and report the facts relating to any alleged violation of the law by any person or corporation
1093057 what market and economic conditions are they shell and the doe waiting for since the passage of ra 8479 weve seen oil prices climb from just 11 per barrel in 1999 to almost 150 per barrel
1093058 now that market conditions have improved considerably with oil prices hovering near or at historic highs shell still refuses to go public
1093059 clearly shells existing shareholders simply do not wish to share their profits with other entities or individuals
1093060 by recommending a naval blockade in the persian gulf congress could likely be responsible for oil prices approaching 200 a barrel which translates to nearly 7 50 a gallon of gas even more significant is the impact such a move would have on the regions stability the mere mention of another war in the middle east sets nerves on edge and blockading iran would create a tinderbox where even a small incident could erupt into a conflagration to say nothing of the fact that a blockade is a prima facie act of war under international law
1093061 its normal to pay those fees when you hire a financial advisor to package a loan for you

1093063 so far no leakage of chemicals or oil from the wreck has been detected i hope that the suggestions made by our experts concerning sampling procedures bio monitoring and precautionary measures will help ensure that this dreadful tragedy does not also turn into an environmental disaster
1093064 this tragic accident underscores once again the crucial role of prevention and the importance of preparedness and contingency planning with regard to industrial and technological emergencies including maritime accidents
1093065 this terrible disaster confirmed the need for improvement in the safety practices of the inter island shipping industry in the philippines
1093066 it is hazardous because ferries lack necessary life saving equipment
1093067 sea travel in the philippines is hazardous you should not travel on ferries unless no other means of travel is available ferries are often overloaded lack necessary life saving equipment and are not adequately maintained storms can develop quickly
1093068 when it cargo arrived its official classification was dg6 meaning that it was poisonous based on the documents that we received it was declared as dangerous cargo
1093069 this is precisely why when the 40 foot container van arrived at the port they stored it in a separate yard the shipment would be delivered to del monte philippines inc dmpi in bukidnon
1093070 in fact they even took a picture of the container van when it left the ictsi property on june 19 it is a standard operating procedure for the company to take pictures of the shipment just before it is brought out of the gate
1093071 what we are concerned about is the shipment from manila to cagayan de oro there should have been a separate declaration for that
1093072 the reduction in electricity rates can be effected through a combination of simple adjustment in regulatory implementing policy and amendment of the epira
1093073 you cannot compare the avoided cost today which is actually not an avoided cost as there is still a subsidy with that when these ipp projects were conceived
1093074 while the study is supposed to analyze the cost structure and the technical financial and regulatory elements of the electric power industry we find that many of the recommendations are lacking in such analysis
1093075 since the full paper is still to be completed we trust that our comments will be addressed in the final output

1093080 some are asking why is there a picture there is a picture to attract attention
1093081 united states absolutely supports the territorial integrity of the philippines we also recognize that the people of mindanao have legitimate aspirations and some grievances
1093082 also lack consensus on the outlines of a deal that may be offered to the moros
1093083 do not necessarily reflect the views of usip which does not advocate specific policy positions
1093084 efforts to help the parties think creatively of ways to overcome long standing obstacles on ancestral domain and to initiate dialogue among disparate moro ethnic groups made usip a valuable contributor to the peace talks
1093085 as with past agreements a serious risk exists that the national legislature could scuttle any agreement signed by the government in the implementation phase the supreme court might also declare unconstitutional any deal on ancestral domain that grants moro significant political authority and control over natural resources
1093086 she could rouse a wave of opposition that might endanger her presidency
1093087 nonetheless if such an agreement were signed and fully implemented it would unequivocally augment the presidents historical legacy after nearly 10 years at the helm of philippine politics
1093088 well informed creative and well intentioned they are in many ways unable to influence those at the center of political power and public opinion

1093106 we dont really know much about them the japs i know the dutch side pretty well i have been to their camp in europe and i have watched them a couple of times i also have tapes on them as well as the americans but there is some measure of mystery surrounding the japanese team
1093107 playing korea would have been good preparations for the japan match and indeed the other group games but that is what is bound to happen when you put your fate in other peoples hands
1093108 he audu organised everything here but i am obviously not happy with the friendly arrangement if i was in charge i would have arranged everything
1093109 the south koreans are playing cote divoire and our match with them is scheduled for the next day
1093110 that was when i first got the feeling that the game against the south koreans will not hold how can a team play two international matches in two days
1093111 we are preparing with what we have on ground but the boys have been wonderful and i know we will go places at the olympics

1093170 figures such as these indicate the extent to which consumers are prepared to alter their behaviour in one way this can be seen as proof of consumer resilience in times of economic hardship it seems britons are making necessary changes to their lifestyles rather than sliding further into debt for example its encouraging to note that the total number of insolvencies in england and wales in the first quarter of 2008 was actually down more than 13 per cent on the same period a year before

1093270 and senator frankly you have a record in the senate thats not very distinguished
1093271 the vice president said that the first time i met senator edwards was tonight when we walked on the stage i guess he forgot the time we sat next to each other for a couple hours about three years ago i guess he forgot the time we met at the swearing in of another senator so my wife elizabeth reminded him on the stage

1093275 i am proud and grateful to have the support of so many michigan business and civic leaders their efforts will help ensure that our message of change in washington reaches all corners of michigan and the country
1093276 can you help us understand what specifically it was that made you change your view on that
1093277 first what i found interesting is had i been pro life and then changed to pro choice no one would ask the question
1093278 but its if you go in the other direction as i have and as ronald reagan did and henry hyde and george herbert walker bush its like the media cant get enough of how why did you change
1093279 but no one ever asks that if they go the other way theres always like well youve come to the side of light the truth is being governor and before i was governor this is something i thought about we discussed as a family i discussed with my staff we talked about the concerns
1093280 and the point where it sort of went over the edge for me and of course its not just didnt just come up for the first time but went over the edge is we were having this debate on cloning and i could see where the roe v wade devaluation of human life had led it had led to a point where people were beginning to say hey now were going to start cloning embryos its like wait a second this really is going too far
1093281 if there ever was a time for great americans great and good americans americans who are willing to cross into the deep waters of life it is now you cross into the deep waters of life by marrying and raising good children there is no work more important to americas future than the work that is done within the four walls of the american home
1093282 and this is a country that can get all of our people insured with not a government takeover without hillary care without socialized medicine instead get the market to do its job let people have health care that they can afford get the market to do its job let people have the opportunity to choose policies in the private sector
1093283 id like middle income americans to be able to save their money and not have to pay any tax at all on interest dividends or capital gains
1093284 of course we get osama bin laden and track him wherever he has to go and make sure he pays for the outrage he exacted on america well move everything to get him but i dont want to buy into the democratic pitch that this is all about one person osama bin laden because after we get him theres going to be another and another this is a global effort were going to have to lead to overcome this jihadist effort its more than osama bin laden but he is going to pay and he will die
1093285 with regards to iraq there are a lot of people that say lets just get out i want to get our troops home as soon as i possibly can but at the same time i recognize we dont want to bring them out in such a precipitous way that we cause a circumstance that would require us to come back because if we leave in the wrong way the iranians could grab the shia south or al qaeda could play a dominant role among the sunnis or you could have the border with turkey destabilized by the kurds and as a result you could have regional conflict develop but with that occurring you could have our neighbors get involved our friends get involved around iraq and we could have to come back again
1093286 someone else considering a run for the white house recently addressed the iran issue and you wont be surprised to find out that i dont agree with her approach
1093287 in a speech last night in new york city senator hillary clinton said that she needs to quote understand unquote iran better and to help her with her education process that we should quote engage iran unquote
1093288 friends someone who doesnt understand iran hasnt been paying attention at this point we dont need a listening tour with iran
1093289 indeed she argued that our strategy of engagement with the soviet union during the cold war was a model for how we could deal with iran
1093290 and someone who wants to engage iran displays a troubling timidity towards a terrible threat
1093291 its a nation where people participate in suicide bombing and that kind of a suggestion i think it was former president rafsanjani who talked about israel being a one bomb nation meaning they could not survive one bomb but they iran could survive one bomb its like are you kidding are you suggesting that youd be willing to take a bomb in order to eliminate another people this is a nation where the genocidal inclination is really frightening and having a nation of this nature develop nuclear weaponry is unacceptable to this country and to the middle east

1093298 america cannot continue to lead the family of nations around the world if we suffer the collapse of the family here at home
1093299 we can praise the virtues of parental involvement all day but until we actually get parents to follow through we are simply singing to an empty music hall voluntary programs will not get the job done it is essential that mandatory training be put in place
1093300 in my service as governor ive never had anyone complain to me that their kids are not learning enough about sex in school however a number of people have asked me why it is that we do not speak more about abstinence as a safe and preventive health practice
1093301 abstinence education gives young people the support they need in making the decision to postpone sexual activity until they are mature enough to handle the emotional moral and financial responsibilities of parenthood
1093302 this is more than teaching kids to say no it will help them preserve self esteem and build character
1093303 i dont see such moral clarity anywhere else in the political spectrum even on the conservative side among some very good people mitt sees into the core of things and confronts moral obfuscation by redirecting the focus back to fundamental truths no punditry no ambition for power no licking of the finger to feel which way the wind is blowing
1093304 at the national level we should define marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman and this isnt about adult rights a lot of people get confused that gay marriage is about treating gay people the same as treating heterosexual people and thats not the issue involved here this is about the development and nurturing of children marriage is primarily an institution to help develop children and childrens development i believe is greatly enhanced by access to a mom and a dad i think every child deserves a mom and a dad and thats why im so consistent and vehement in my view that we should have a federal amendment which defines marriage in that way
1093305 and there are gay couples that are having children of their own and thats obviously thats their right but my belief is that the idea setting for a child is where theres a mom and a dad
1093306 florida is a dynamic and diverse state representative of all that is great about america

1093312 i am proud to have the support of these respected and accomplished lawmakers
1093313 through republican leadership florida has become a national model for translating conservative principles into successful policies we showed the same type of discipline in massachusetts and that is exactly what is needed now in washington i look forward to sharing my vision with floridians as we discuss the solutions needed to meet a new generation of challenges
1093314 chris has a distinguished record of public service in central florida and extensive experience in local republican grassroots campaigning i am thankful for his support
1093315 we both agree that to keep america strong we must strengthen our military strengthen our economy and strengthen families as we quickly approach florida s january primary i look forward to sharing this optimistic vision for our countys future with voters across the sunshine state

1093318 i thank these florida leaders for their support in helping us build an even stronger grassroots organization in the sunshine state
1093319 by effecting true conservative change we will be ready to address the new challenges we must confront together if the american dream is to reach all corners of our country
1093320 governor romney is the only candidate that is presenting substantive policies and reforms to address the problems americans face today with a record of innovative leadership it is clear that he is uniquely qualified to provide the leadership we need to expand access to affordable health care keep our taxes low raise the bar on education and keep our country safe
1093321 i am proud to lead such an impressive group of floridians as we work hard to elect governor romney the next president of the united states
1093322 you may have heard weve been cleaning house now were moving the house after three months of evaluation the cuppys management team and i have determined that it is in the best interest for the future success of our franchisees and the company to relocate the corporate offices to muscle shoals al effective september 1

1093345 the compactrio embedded system and labview graphical tools from national instruments gave us the power to design prototype and deploy the control system within our visica2 medical device quickly and beat our time to market goals while saving money by eliminating the need for building custom hardware the rio architecture and new low cost hardware help us even further by allowing us to quickly move to lower cost hardware when deploying our machines at high volume without having to redesign software or start over from scratch with a new design
1093346 we were able to rapidly prototype our system for fedex using labview and compactrio and create a final deployed solution with ni single board rio all in under a year the fact that ni provides hardware and software to quickly prototype and deploy embedded systems was crucial for us were quite sure we wouldnt have been able to hit our aggressive deadlines without ni tools
1093347 searching for initiatives to make its fleet more energy efficient
1093348 this is all about attracting staff using different modes of delivery because of the problems australia post is having attracting staff with motorbike licences
1093349 they are doing this to reduce costs minimise potential accidents on the road and also reduce fuel costs
1093350 if they could wave the magic wand and get all their delivery done without using a motorbike yes they would
1093351 we are arguing that the reason they have motorbikes is it is the most efficient mode of delivery
1093352 at the moment those rounds are having to be covered by the other posties who are doing extra work
1093353 they can only do that for so long before they chuck it in it is getting to be a real pressure point
1093354 there is no petrol involved at all petrol is yesterdays technology
1093355 however this is not a motorcycle they are power assisted bicycles the motor is there to assist pedalling not a substitute for it
1093356 fuel costs and a need for cleaner forms of delivery mean some areas could benefit from these alternative forms of transport and we are keen to explore this possibility
1093357 we are also trying alternative fuels such as propane natural gas and lpg and using the new gas injected diesel technology
1093358 in addition we have in the past 12 months undertaken a hybrid truck trial which has demonstrated benefits both in terms of reduced fuel consumption and lower emissions but unfortunately currently has a limited application to our fleet

1093360 the majority of operators run professional high quality centres and they have nothing to worry about
1093361 we will continue to work with childcare centres and pre schools to address problems as they arise but if they consistently fail to fix any identified issues then we will take more serious action such as prosecution or revoking operators licences
1093362 these are the key issues thats why well be making sure that anyone who breaks those and faces prosecution when they are prosecuted they will be put on this website

1093364 peter was very up front the day after the election he did the right thing by the party he made his intentions clear and that was that he wasnt available for the leadership of the party
1093365 peter costello in my view has earned the right to make a decision in his interests and that of his family and the electors of higgins in due course and announce it when hes ready to do so
1093366 its not just unwanted adult cats and dogs that are being put to death its kittens and puppies as well
1093367 in addition to trialling different methods of encouraging identification and desexing they will also collect baseline data to monitor the numbers of levels of animals being euthanased

1093369 the reality is that we will be hit by an influenza pandemic at some point but we dont know if it will be this year or in 50 years time so governments are loathe to spend the money and the effort when they dont know

1093371 the significance of this is for other groups of patients with neurological impairment

1093373 the significance of this is for other groups of patients with neurological impairment
1093374 do all of these patients have the same mechanism for reflux and swallowing disorders if not performing a fundoplication anti reflux surgery may not help in fact it may make things worse like it did in the rett girls
1093375 this issue is of particular interest to pediatricians who refer these patients for their reflux problems
1093376 if we develop a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the problems being experienced by these children we just might be able to find a way to make life a little more comfortable for them
1093377 i dont think the city understands how difficult it is to do a project like this without their support
1093378 if they view their responsibility to work this hard to pull this project rather than helping expedite it then it will never be done
1093379 to give a guy like greg who has done a lot for the city a little extra time seems appropriate
1093380 to give a guy like greg who has done a lot for the city a little extra time seems appropriate
1093381 it does appear he did not comply with their requests
1093382 the electronic control device was deployed that didnt work so they had to relay on a higher level of force
1093383 we offer our deepest sympathies to the families and will be working directly with them and the two seaspan survivors to provide grief and trauma counselling

1093386 with respect to the bail hearing its still subject to interpretation
1093387 its sure that this new provision is intended to reduce street crime
1093388 the first thing we need is a national strategy to reduce violent crime
1093389 limit its main response to violence to reacting to it after it has happened
1093390 without the long term vision there will be other dangerous people to step into the shoes of the people who are detained
1093391 everything is pretty good grant golding a gymnast from calgary said monday
1093392 the athletes village is really nice the gyms are great
1093393 i am trying to find problems the former olympic gold medallist diver said while eating lunch at the athletes village
1093394 we are working out the little details making sure the athletes are comfortable
1093395 the athletes are very pleased with the village and the training venues and competition sites most have been here for test events but to come back and see all the improvements that have been made we knew the chinese were going to be ready but we are very pleased with what we see right now
1093396 its one of the nicest apartments ive ever stayed in said burnes who is competing at his first olympics
1093397 i have been here three days and two of the three were very nice said bernier
1093398 we are still confident that by the time the games start the air quality will be good
1093399 we are hoping in the next three days the sky will be blue and the air quality will be there
1093400 you try not to get out in the sun too much so you dont get tired from sweating all day he said
1093401 all the athletes are shooting in the same climate he said
1093402 every athlete that we have talked to is very impressed and amazed by the quality of this village said bernier
1093403 personally i have never seen such a nice village in nine games
1093404 after being here a week you get the same kind of things
1093405 they were taking every question seriously and making sure they will solve every problem she said
1093406 of course we will have a couple of problems along the way
1093407 every where you go there are not two or three people trying to help you there are 10 or 15 people that want to help you and make it easier for you bernier said
1093408 we had a huge number of people who were in a position to see the atrocities that were going on in bosnia
1093409 theres going to be a lot of focus on srebrenica but there were a lot of other things that karadzic should be held accountable for the canadians were directly witnessing the ethnic cleansing going on more generally
1093410 the canadian involvement in the analysis of the remains is huge
1093411 my role largely throughout much of that time was monitoring the mass grave exhumations some related to srebrenica of course and other mass graves
1093412 at this time we have excavated and examined 23 secondary mass graves related to one execution event
1093413 we are aware that there are several more graves that need to be exhumed
1093414 the reassociations are extremely complex and one persons remains may be recovered from several secondary mass graves dozens of kilometres apart
1093415 we dont really need to put them back together we associate them for identification purposes but we certainly reassociate them as much as possible for the victims themselves and their family members
1093416 perhaps part of it is that it does not change the fact that those men and boys were executed and we are still in the process of trying to recover identify and repatriate them to their family members
1093417 it was considered at the time that i went there as an undesirable posting
1093418 i would like to think that it continued but i dont know if it did
1093419 every serb you talk to will give you a history lesson before they get to the root of their problem at the time

1093427 he is well versed in public law and his integrity and leadership will serve the city organization and the people of cincinnati well
1093428 cincinnatis growth and investment in public projects are two very exciting reasons to come to the city
1093429 i am looking forward to being part of the positive contributions that cincinnatis government is making in the community
1093430 the collaborative and sharing aspect of the mashup application is very exciting to us at esri
1093431 it is what we and our user community have been working toward for the last 15 years the collaboration and sharing of data will present endless opportunities for the building of important gis applications
1093432 webgis is a platform that can be used to connect all your gis business systems
1093433 and everything must fall from the sky and rise from the ground and then go back down
1093434 its just like a primitive synthesizer that uses your body to complete the signal in a cigar box
1093435 every sector and sub genre of hip hop in the world exists in south africa
1093436 you have pure dance club hits but with a distinct south african swing they either rap in zulu or another traditional language or the music is influenced theres even an underground style more left of centre like what aesop rock and them are doing
1093437 then theres a culture of hustling and trying to make it out of the hood also there are people who are influenced by the history of the country who are political and socially aware its very diverse
1093438 i wanted to bring people closer to who tumi is and the things i believe in the things with the volume are just as strong but not as personal theres a band philosophy behind that but solo this is my opus my maxim my beliefs as an individual
1093439 that said ive been working on a new record and its weird because the stuff i will be performing in ca nada will be off music from my good eye motif my first solo and the volume record but nothing off the new stuff but thats really where i am in my headspace
1093440 the way they consider die hard the perfect action movie i think illmatic is the perfect example of a hip hop record
1093441 constructing an album is my favourite part after performing live

1093444 i know pablo noreaga the real noreaga he owe me a hundred favours
1093445 if it was a third party application that just happened to work with the platform and its sold through a different channel with no affiliation with apple just the fact they are compatible apples not liable
1093446 but if apple is selling the app through their store they can become liable so im sure it makes them more conservative
1093447 apple has taken it down again with no explanation yet again
1093448 the app store is being marketed as a quality and security assurance measure but thats not what it is
1093449 its a control and exclusivity measure its an extension of the digital restrictions management system thats imposed on the iphone which prevents users from installing their own software from any third party sources this means that apple can prevent certain applications from being installed on the computer that make it do things they dont want users to be able to do for example install a client to monitor voice minutes and data exchange to make sure that the billing from the phone company is correct or install a music player that plays file formats that apple would prefer not become popular like ogg vorbis
1093450 a signing system like the app store uses could indeed be a very useful security measure
1093451 but only if the user herself holds the keys and remains in control of her own computer
1093452 the problem with security measures like what apple is trying to push is that they are actually security for apple against the user not for the user against threats the user is asked to blindly trust a corporation with different interests than her own and is legally and technologically blocked from being able to monitor or verify that trust
1093453 finally she could show people the many happy memories she had gathered over a lifetime and they could see the world through her eyes

1093458 although the city has been growing there are fewer vehicles entering the city than there were 10 years ago and average distances being driven by vancouver registered passenger vehicles were down almost 30 between 1993 and 2002 when density is well located close to shopping areas and community amenities more people can travel without a car to obtain goods and services these non work trips are the fastest growing types of trips and while not everyone can live close to their work locating more housing close to transit increases the number of work trips that are not by car

1093461 sobering production figures for those hoping that fuel prices can be lowered
1093462 the bush administration in its effort to expand energy production has issued more than three times the number of well drilling permits on western lands as in the clinton administrations last six years but oil production in that region during the bush years is 12 percent below average levels from the clinton era according to federal data
1093463 the expansion of the energy industry has subdivided parts of western wyoming and western colorado into a rabbit warren of wellheads and roads the pinedale wyo area had its first ozone alerts last winter thanks to a combination of factors natural gas flaring from scores of wells increased vehicle traffic associated with drilling activities and seasonal temperature inversions one study showed that the mule deer herd that migrates near pinedale declined by nearly half from 2000 to 2005
1093464 is the oil business the new whaling business and if so is that a good sign or a troubling one
1093465 whaling after all was one of the worlds first great multinational businesses a global enterprise of audacious reach and import from the 1700s through the mid 1800s oil extracted from the blubber of whales and boiled in giant pots gave light to america and much of the western world the united states whaling fleet peaked in 1846 with 735 ships out of 900 in the world whaling was the fifth largest industry in the united states in 1853 alone 8 000 whales were slaughtered for whale oil shipped to light lamps around the world plus sundry other parts used in hoop skirts perfume lubricants and candles
1093466 theres simply no way with 2 percent of the worlds oil reserves that you can solve our problems by drilling
1093467 if china continues to increase its use of oil at the average pace of 6 to 7 percent a year as it has since 1990 it will consume as much as the united states in more than 20 years
1093468 transport and land use management strategies that improve mobility options reduce total motor vehicle traffic and create more accessible land use patterns tend to provide multiple benefits
1093469 americans should not have to choose between swimming and sewage when baking on the beach

1093474 its the wild south west out there which always ran on tribal lines it was never controlled by kabul and the border with pakistan is almost impossible to police
1093475 until a year ago we were based in fort george in inverness then trained in kenya and have been away in afghanistan for four months yet the welcome here has been amazing
1093476 that in 2009 they will get the chance to really enjoy tern hill
1093477 we are making a difference our main role is an operational mentor liaison team pairing with the afghan national army not just to beat the taliban but also win the confidence of locals in the time weve been there you can really see the progress
1093478 they learn quickly have become more professional and the army has increased not only in numbers but in capability its a really positive sign that we are contributing to something enduring we are not there to run their country far from it our role is training and mentoring
1093479 for instance the afghan army will now patrol at night something the men never did has the confidence to move into other areas support locals take responsibility and show initiative with their own police and security
1093480 wear a royal irish wristband and show that you care
1093481 they are hitting law abiding families with massive fines while professional criminals get the soft touch
1093482 it is clear whitehall bureaucrats are instructing town halls to target householders with fines for minor breaches
1093483 yet with the slow death of weekly collections and shrinking bins its hard for families to dispose of rubbish responsibly
1093484 the guidance is not new it sets fines at between 75 and 110
1093485 fixed penalty notice fines are an alternative to prosecution and were called for by local authorities so that they could react to the severity and frequency of the environmental offence and offender and ensure our streets are kept clean for all of us
1093486 it can be a very upsetting experience for visitors and locals who use the steps and come across the filthy residue that people leave behind
1093487 the lower section continues to be misused by a few which makes it unpleasant for the majority
1093488 it has been a marvellous year weve had so much fun and people have been incredibly generous in supporting the appeal with everything from donations at family celebrations and sponsored events to concerts and cake stalls
1093489 john and sarah offering their marquee and staying on after their wedding to help prepare it for us is the sort of kindness which is really humbling
1093490 both hospices are a vital part of our county life it is a pleasure and a privilege to help them i am keeping the golden years account open for the occasional joint event and its typical of such wonderful warm hearted friends that about 440 was donated at the tea party to start the next phase of fundraising
1093491 we pride ourselves on using quality sustainable ingredients brought to us by growers from the region showcasing local products raises the consciousness of the public to the variety and quality of local foodstuffs
1093492 global american with an emphasis on fresh seafood and beef with seasonal ingredients
1093493 i wanted this event to be the first of many in which people who eat the food get to know the people who provided it
1093494 i invite all kentuckians to go to their local farmers market and see what all the excitement is about
1093495 dont like to give advice on subjects im unfamiliar with so at this stage im handing the baton over to you dear readers to suggest ideas to help with
1093496 uncanny x men 500 feels like the x men comics i read many years ago due to the high level of excitement and fun that theyve infused into their comic

1093498 fraction and brubakers script has a weird charm to it they tell the kind of quick hitting yarn that doesnt exist in the modern world of superhero comics
1093499 brubaker and fraction have successfully put these children of the atom face forward with the task of saving themselves from extinction and building a community out of a population smaller than most midwestern towns can they succeed who else will stand in their way its a great time to be an x fan

1093527 just about a week ago i was talking to the commanding general and i told him i thought we were on the cusp of achieving durable security
1093528 i thought as i arrived in the country that was a pretty lofty goal a tough mission
1093529 what im seeing on the battlefield right now is telling me there has been a fundamental change in the and we are moving out fast to exploit that
1093530 what im seeing is a level of confidence i havent seen before and a willingness to take a risk to open a store transit the area to drive around to spend a little money on better clothes
1093531 one thing ive noticed is that when the security situation is better people dress better
1093532 i dont like it when people easily condemn someone who has an addiction as if he were a criminal as if he were a person who should be persecuted
1093533 those who should be persecuted are those who sell the substances those who give it away those who traffic in it
1093534 i dont think the city understands how difficult it is to do a project like this without their support
1093535 if they view their responsibility to work this hard to pull this project rather than helping expedite it then it will never be done

1093538 it is becoming extremely important for our customers to have mobile content that is innovative and unique gameloft is one of the perfect partners to do that
1093539 we are excited to offer our best titles for emobile the pioneer creating a new mobile broadband business
1093540 from action adventure to casual games gameloft has an eclectic catalogue of 250 plus titles including 50 games that sold over 1 million copies worldwide we are extremely proud to launch our distribution for emobile

1093543 people are coming up to me saying this is a common sense sensible way to deal with the issue of personal use
1093544 completes what miyamoto wrote in his proposal when he came up with the idea for the wii
1093545 miyamoto was saying that he needs to think up more ideas now
1093546 we might think up some more and we might make them if we do but we dont have any plans to release a whole lot more
1093547 there will be games that will be enhanced by the wii motion plus as well as games that can only be played with it users will need four if they have four controllers but were going to try to offer it for as little as possible we havent announced the price yet but the cost of making the wii motion plus is not that much so i think we can make it very affordable
1093548 i think were doing significantly better than other devices that offer similar services were trying constantly to think of ways that the ds could be used more often in everyday life services we can offer that will make people want to take their ds with them everywhere we need to convince all kinds of customers that they should own a ds
1093549 mobile phone services have to be compatible with many different models and their formats but we can customize services specifically for the ds so its much easier to use
1093550 still an entertainment one first and foremost but the definition of videogames has changed if we keep our view of what a videogame constitutes as broad as possible then naturally were going to be doing things that people might say arent games
1093551 if we can do something different that plays up our strengths and broadens what a videogame constitutes then we might do it if we have no ideas were not going to compete with the exact same services against companies like sony which has a movie studio and microsoft which has a lot of money
1093552 our sales may have grown beyond expectations but there are still a lot of people who have never played videogames well have to start thinking about how to make our products appealing in developing countries well have a whole new dimension of issues to tackle like pricing quantity availability and regional adaptation were not going to meet our goals that easily
1093553 but what they think up doesnt necessarily become a product
1093554 it is not taking the place of a site visit and is not part of the decision making process

1093557 a weaker opening on wall street has not helped the uk today and the pessimistic mood that has dogged the market since the middle of last week is still around

1093561 im counting on our seniors to take the recent success of the program and carry on with that tradition
1093562 we have a large group of experienced players and some young talent on the team our seniors have to take their past experiences and lead us forward their leadership will be crucial in how successful 2008 can be
1093563 this team needs greer amanda and deana to step up their play and be leaders on and off the field
1093564 they will be counted on to consistently contribute at a high level and lead our team these three will play an integral part in us getting off to a good start
1093565 a year ago we had three special seniors at forward who logged a lot of minutes we stressed this spring how important it was for everyone to realize what roles need to be filled up top
1093566 the midfield needs to develop and take on a scoring mentality but there are also girls who have waited for an opportunity there are plenty of capable returning players and newcomers who can make an impact up top
1093567 my philosophy has always been to build around a strong defense anyone who has been around the game long enough knows how difficult sometimes goal scoring can be limiting opposing teams chances and striving for shutouts is critical for any good team we need players to step up and be aggressive like natalie cocchi was for us at center back our defense must come together early for our team to be successful
1093568 goalkeeping is really one of many competitive positions on the field for us this fall ended the season so strong and did some wonderful things for us is game tested and is coming off a great spring
1093569 we had a very productive spring and will need to carry that success into the fall season
1093570 as the spring finished up we were able to see where we excelled and where we need to improve as training camp approaches
1093571 we have another versatile freshman class in terms of overall ability
1093572 they understand the value and importance of hard work and can be counted on to contribute immediately if called upon
1093573 we have a very competitive season in front of us but we are excited
1093574 i sound like a broken record but if you want to be the best then you truly have to play the best our schedule features a challenging non conference schedule to go with a tough conference slate
1093575 the project calls for landscaped beds planters benches ornamental lighting and brick pavers placed on a concrete base the new pavers are supposed to have a longer life than the original ones in addition to making the site more aesthetically appealing
1093576 the project leaves space for an art piece that could be anchored near the entry on monroe avenue perhaps the art museum could put a sculpture in at the focal point said steer
1093577 the project calls for landscaped beds planters benches ornamental lighting and brick pavers placed on a concrete base the new pavers are supposed to have a longer life than the original ones in addition to making the site more aesthetically appealing
1093578 the project leaves space for an art piece that could be anchored near the entry on monroe avenue
1093579 i wonder why the habit in downtown sidewalks and on brick streets around the city is to lay concrete first and lay paver in sand on top is so prevalent or on some sidewalks they cement them in place the winter always breaks up the cement the best way used by local paver installers is to lay about 8

1093581 the united states is now winning the war that two years ago seemed lost
1093582 despite the occasional bursts of violence iraq has reached the point where the insurgents who once controlled whole cities no longer have the clout to threaten the viability of the central government

1093585 many texas residents are unprepared for the fast approaching dtv transition especially those who live along the border households that continue watching stations from mexico rather than taking steps to prepare for the transition may not receive amber alert and emergency alert system messages
1093586 the senate passed bill will give border broadcasters flexibility to broadcast in both analog and digital formats beyond the transition date so border residents access to important public safety information is not threatened
1093587 thanks to longstanding public policy encouraging responsible production 18 of all the oil and 30 of all the natural gas produced onshore in the u s is produced in this state that makes us the no 1 energy producing state in america
1093588 for far too long in this country we have failed to adequately protect the right of our troops to participate in our democratic process our men and women in uniform make tremendous sacrifices in the defense of freedom and the american way of life and they deserve the u s governments very best efforts to promote and protect their voting rights
1093589 as such we respectfully request that the department of justice directs the necessary attention and resources to correct the unacceptable and well documented deficiencies in the military voting system specifically we ask that the doj investigate and determine whether the federal voting assistance program fvap is fulfilling its legal obligations to provide overseas u s military service members and their dependents with the necessary information and assistance to register to vote request and receive absentee ballots and vote
1093590 only 59 percent of surveyed military service members knew where to obtain voting information on base and only 40 percent had received voting information or assistance from a voting assistance officer
1093591 moreover only one third of the requested ballots were cast and counted in other words only 5 5 percent of the total eligible military and overseas citizen voters cast a ballot in the november 2006 election
1093592 the right to participate in democratic elections is fundamental to the american experience our men and women in uniform have stepped forward to defend that right often at great personal cost to them and their loved ones we have a duty to ensure these americans have a voice in choosing their elected leaders and we urge you to help us protect their rights
1093593 as the chief elections officer for the state of texas it is important to me that we make every effort to protect the voting rights of the men and women who are risking their lives on foreign soil to preserve the liberties and freedoms we enjoy in the united states i look forward to working with sen cornyn in his efforts to ensure the secure transmission of ballots to and from our troops overseas

1093597 friday we witnessed the power that the american public is granted in the words of the constitution
1093598 the level of energy and tenacity on the house floor was unlike anything i have ever witnessed before
1093599 instead my democrat colleagues have chosen to scatter into the five week recess without any substantive vote addressing our energy crisis leaving americans to deal with five more long weeks of higher than necessary prices at the pump we are dependent on foreign crude oil and must deal with our current situation and drill domestically to achieve lower prices it is that simple i want to encourage americans across the country to join me today in demanding action from congress on this important issue

1093828 we dont comment on campaigns that are utter and complete failures
1093829 you find you can eliminate a fair number of people without eliminating much content
1093830 supported by fed chairman alan greenspan and treasury secretary larry summers
1093831 but we must enact comprehensive immigration reform we must make it a top agenda item if we dont do it before and we probably wont a little straight talk as of january 2009
1093832 mr mccain has made some gains in reassuring conservatives nervous about his views on issues like immigration polls suggest
1093833 there were not all of these pundits and bloggers and everything who were all over it
1093834 you bloggers do a great job digging up stories for us in the msm keep it up
1093835 on a message to balance the crazy left wing things a president obama is sure to try
1093836 what it says is that im not very well known in that part of the country
1093837 sen clinton i think is much better known coming from a nearby state of arkansas so its not surprising that she would have an advantage in some of those states in the middle
1093838 last time i checked illinois was more nearby kentucky than arkansas heck they even touch
1093839 i snt there something a tad condescending in his reference to
1093840 you dont run for president unless you want to work in the administration
1093841 clearly what is going on in brazil is pushing that envelope
1093842 i would never say never but it would be a hard sell
1093843 dont you think theres a major difference between a pol who admits he sired a love child and one who denies it
1093844 voted for george bush i know it for dead certitude
1093845 i know neither actor but i assume they were acting
1093846 unless we enact comprehensive immigration reform i dont think you can take it piecemeal
1093847 because as soon you and i start to talk about the highly skilled workers our agricultural interest people are going to say look we need ag workers too
1093848 we get in this kind of a circular firing squad on immigration reform in the congress of the united states
1093849 and the lesson i learned from it is weve got to have comprehensive immigration reform
1093850 a flake and a poser and an attention seeking diva
1093851 if he wants to stay and turn newcastle into a successful club then thats great and he should come out and say something sooner rather than later the same applies if he has decided he wants to sell up
1093852 id like to see the uncertainty removed my main concern is if he is going to sell the club that it ends up in the hands of people who are determined to turn us into a successful club

1093865 am wochenende f hrt fast alle 15 minuten jemand gegen die einbahn
1093866 das kommt sicher hie und da vor mir ist das einmal aufgefallen beim autofahrer handelte es sich um einen steirer der orts unkundig war
1093867 acho que podemos dar uma grande contribui o ao estado
1093868 ich bereue schon dass ich das handy abgehoben habe wir stehen jetzt als die gr ten trotteln da und k nnen nichts daf r
1093869 es waren zeitgleich zwei unf lle die verkehrleitzentrale hat versucht das kurzfristig zu managen es mussten innerhalb k rzester zeit zw lf busfahrer aufgetrieben werden was an einem samstag in der urlaubszeit wirklich nicht einfach ist das war eine besondere herausforderung
1093870 wir werden dem problem nachgehen es gibt ja ber alles genaue aufzeichnungen darum wird sich das qualit tsmanagement k mmern
1093871 im juli ist auf dieser strecke kein einziger zug ausgefallen
1093872 a ufba motivo de grande orgulho para a bahia e o brasil ela o ber o da intelig ncia no estado e merece todo o empenho da nossa bancada no congresso para garantir que os alunos da universidade tenham um ensino superior p blico de qualidade
1093873 das h tt ich nie gedacht dass hier so viele verschiedene aufgabengebiete auf mich warten langweilig wird es mir in den kommenden drei wochen sicher nicht
1093874 ich habe bereits im vergangenen jahr ein ferialpraktikum gemacht dieses hier in der b cherei ist heuer sogar schon mein zweites zuvor habe ich drei wochen in der sparkasse gejobbt
1093875 telefonieren darf sie auch f r die jungen leute ist so ein praktikum auf jeden fall eine gute schule f r das sp tere leben
1093876 dieses projekt wird in die gesamtgeschichte von k rnten eingehen
1093877 wir werden noch r umlichkeiten f r museumszwecke ausstellungen vernissagen und seminare schaffen
1093878 unsere 80 aktiven mitglieder sind eben nicht nur als lebensretter im dienste der allgemeinheit im einsatz unser hauptaugenmerk liegt auf der ausbildung
1093879 although it may be possible for a new u s administration to repudiate the disastrous bush policy
1093880 a tremendous amount of damage will already have been done
1093881 it hurts in wrestling its not a big mattress out there
1093882 thats a myth its not a big mattress with big rubber bands around it its a steel frame with wood not a lot of padding
1093883 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1093884 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1093885 this transformation will be costly and given the fiscal disaster we will inherit from the last administration it will likely require us to defer some other priorities
1093886 like all compromises this one has its drawbacks it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1093887 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1093888 like george bush and dick cheney before him he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than 1 million from big oil just last month
1093889 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1093890 a windfall profits tax on big oil to give families a thousand dollar rebate
1093891 it was sen obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
1093892 its just time to see how we are in relationship to the market
1093893 i want to hear all opinions and see what our potential is
1093894 a comprehensive strategy on improving the operation and financial condition
1093895 i felt that since we represented defense with our gloves we should do something to honor the best in that area
1093896 and what better way than with a glove a golden glove at that
1093897 at the time it was very common for pitchers to throw out to the umpire baseballs that would be doctored in some way to affect the pitching
1093898 when you look around mount prospect you see my dad
1093899 he really had a youthful spirit about him he was very proud of that gold glove

1093906 my granddaughter asked for a prayer she teaches in central phoenix charter school a last chance high school many of her students are drug dealers gang members and or mothers at 15 she is starting a prayer group with several christian teachers im proud of her for teaching where she teaches by choice she tells me she works in a mission field and she does the prayer follows classical christian structure praise thanksgiving intercession petition benediction note that distinctive christian prayer is also trinitarian that is each person of the holy trinity is named in the prayer this prayer could be offered in parts with a different person reading each section the prayer is brief and general as group prayers usually are
1093907 the boys and girls who live with hiv are here and we are growing up with many goals
1093908 we want to be artists teachers doctors even get married and have kids but achieving these goals will only be possible when we receive the attention we need when we are guaranteed the medicines that we need when we are accepted in schools
1093909 its like a little ball that has little dots and is inside me sort of swimming inside me
1093910 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
1093911 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbors
1093912 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent
1093913 i want to congratulate all the boys and girls who have graduated and got good grades
1093914 sometimes i have so much fun that i forget i have this
1093915 depending on the type of drug and how long youve been taking it it can remain in your system from one to five days
1093916 to be on the safe side always ask the pharmacist about the effects of your medications on sun exposure theyll go online and get current accurate information
1093917 there have been some bad cases tanning booths primarily emit uva rays and thats what medications mainly interact with
1093918 i recommend spf 15 the stronger sunscreens often give people a false sense of security
1093919 spf 15 is fine for going to and from the store but use spf 30 for longer sun exposure or if youre taking medications
1093920 a problem is that these ingredients arent stable for a very long time
1093921 most people use at best half of what they need if you put it on too thin it doesnt give you protection
1093922 sunscreen wears off when youre sweating or in the water remember to cover your hands and feet with sunscreen too

1093954 the most important lesson ive learned comes from something freud said he said thinking is rehearsing what freud meant was that thinking is no substitute for acting in this world in investing in any field there is no substitute for taking action
1093955 mr morgan im sorry to bother you but i own some stocks that have been acting poorly and im very anxious about these stocks in fact worrying about those stocks is starting to ruin my health yet i still like the stocks its a terrible dilemma what do you think i should do sir

1093990 weve sunk all the budget for new programming on one programme
1093991 showing exactly the same programmes as we did when it was uktv gold
1093992 were still only showing the same half dozen shows and completely ignoring the hundreds of comedy programmes from the bbc archive that are screaming for another stab at the airwaves
1093993 weve done a couple of clip shows because in a way seeing fearne cotton doing an impersonation of baldrick saying he has a cunning plan in amongst lots of out of context clippage is much better than a new comedy programme
1093994 uktv drama will be mostly the same only weve given half the shows to watch
1093995 or the half dozen crime shows weve bought the rights to which didnt leave much budget for anything you might not have seen before
1093996 the fact weve taken the bold decision to re brand our entire entertainment portfolio
1093997 weve renamed a few channels because were incorrectly assuming the reason dave had become such a big success was because of the stupid name wed given it

1094006 i cannot understand how an argentine player who has been in pre selection for the olympic squad and has played in the uefa champions league and at a club like liverpool is not good enough

1094008 obviously i was disappointed to hear that gareths head is a bit all over the place at the moment and they asked for some more time

1094052 i am pleased that we have been able to sustain the growth that we demonstrated earlier this year through this quarter while improving our operating margins and net income from the first quarter
1094053 the investments we have made in infrastructure technology and personnel since we became a public company last year are beginning to reflect themselves in improved earnings trends although sales during the next six months may decline slightly due to the reduced exposure to the new school construction business we expect total revenues for the year to exceed 63 million and operating margins to continue to improve moreover i believe we will continue to see significant progress throughout the remainder of the year as we are well positioned across our business segments
1094054 at infinity we continued to make significant advances in our pipeline this past quarter particularly with the recent developments in our anti chaperone program
1094055 we remain in a strong financial position we are delivering on the research and development objectives we laid out at the beginning of the year and we are on track to achieve important catalysts including the planned launch of a pivotal trial of ipi 504 later this year
1094056 we are delighted to have expanded our clinical program by entering into a phase 1 clinical trial with ipi 493 our proprietary oral anti chaperone therapy
1094057 this marked an important event for infinity and we are pleased to have our second product candidate in the clinic we are confident in the broad potential of our anti chaperone portfolio and in our teams ability to continue advancing those programs in order to bring important new medicines to patients
1094058 we saw strong revenue and net income growth and continue to expand our leadership and strategic position we launched 19 new products in the area of sample and assay technologies with a focus on gene and protein function analysis and in june also started shipping of our new flagship platform the qiasymphony which was launched in january 2008 and already received significant interest from our customers across all segments in line with our projected timelines in july we transitioned the few remaining projects related to the digene integration to the line functions in the organization and concluded the digene integration project in time and above target in terms of planned cost synergies
1094059 we further expanded our market and technology leadership in molecular diagnostics by adding two important products to qiagens instrumentation platform through the acquisition of corbett life science in july this year both products the rotor gene real time pcr cycler and the cas instrument a reaction set up system can be seamlessly combined with qiagens sample and assay technologies portfolio in addition the cycler technology can easily be integrated into the qiasymphony platform to complete an automated system which covers the whole workflow from sample preparation to result measurement in all key areas of pcr based assay analysis
1094060 we are very pleased with our financial performance in this second quarter of 2008 reported revenues were in line with and adjusted earnings per share exceeded our expectations we experienced a strong adjusted operating margin increase to 28 in the second quarter 2008 which corresponds to a growth rate of 68 year over year reflecting the achievement of cost synergies following the acquisition of digene
1094061 revenue growth for the second quarter was 61 and was fueled by a strong organic growth of 11 and a positive contribution of 41 at constant currencies from acquisitions our sample and assay portfolio contributed 64 growth 55 at constant exchange rates qiagens instrumentation business recorded a growth rate of 39 30 at constant exchange rates based on the new instruments qiasymphonysp and qiaxcel which started shipping during the second quarter net sales in the americas for the second quarter 2008 represented 49 of our overall business and recorded a growth rate of 96 95 at constant currencies while european sales which represent 40 of our revenues showed a growth rate of 38 22 at constant exchange rates net sales in asia remained strong showing a growth rate of 35 24 at constant exchange rates

1094064 our second quarter revenues came in line with our guidance while gross margin and eps were both above our guidance we are also pleased to report that according to isuppli weve become the worldwide number one display driver supplier for large sized tft lcd panel applications with a market share of 20 4 in the first quarter of 2008 furthermore our non driver products accounted for 5 4 of our total revenues in the second quarter the first time in our history to exceed 5 we are proud that we have built our expertise from within and possess a great level of grasp on our intellectual properties and a top notch r amp d team to capitalize potential business opportunities
1094065 to be the worlds leading semiconductor solution provider for the flat panel display industry has been our long term goal since day one of our company we have chosen our tft lcd driver ic to be the first entry into that market and we are proud to be where we are today in that segment the success in the driver business has enabled us to invest aggressively in a number of other areas we are happy to report that we are experiencing strong momentum in literally all of those areas we are working hard to make sure these non driver segments will continue to contribute more to our business in the long term needlessly to say we remain fully committed to expanding our leadership position in the driver ic market which will always be a core to our business for the foreseeable future
1094066 we feel that the current uncertainties in the worldwide economy and the reduced consumer spending are having a negative impact to our third quarter results since the end of the second quarter we have seen many of our panel customers announcing measures to control inventory and reduce capacity utilization which naturally result in downward revisions to their forecast demands on our display drivers customers turning conservative at a supposed high season has added complexity and further lowered our visibility in gauging our short term business outlook we expect third quarter revenues to decline by low teen percent from the second quarter 2008 and expect gross margin to decline by 1 to 2 we also expect gaap eps to be in the range of 0 04 to 0 06 and non gaap eps to be in the range of 0 11 to 0 14
1094067 natural gas prices remained strong in the second quarter of 2008 which has benefited our bottom line
1094068 we have been able to position the company to accelerate development of our property base in this market with the projected cash flow future increases in our borrowing base and our 100 drilling success we recently completed a 134 million follow on equity offering net of offering expenses which allowed us to repay our bank line of credit and to have an additional 36 million in funding for haynesville bossier shale development and acreage additions the market for natural gas and oil has experienced a correction in the last few weeks but the long term outlook remains strong and the company has recently increased its revenue and cash flow guidance and capital expenditure budget for the year the company intends to add two additional leased rigs operating on its 100 acreage in the second half of 2008 for a total of six gmxr owned or operated rigs
1094069 as previously announced we intend to drill haynesville bossier horizontal gas shale wells with four of the rigs and cotton valley vertical wells with the remaining two in 2009 we intend to add 5 new fit for purpose rigs to drill our gas shale wells with the activity of the other 6 operated rigs to be determined as the new rigs arrive
1094070 the second quarter of 2008 has marked records in production revenue earnings and cash flow for the company and positions us to continue to accelerate our successful drilling program add meaningful operated acreage in the arklatex region and deliver shareholder value
1094071 acceleration of the haynesville bossier development funded by our growing cash flow and credit line is expected to increase the present value of our 1p amp 2p reserves we have grown our operated acreage over 130 in 2008 through july 31 2008 including the addition of 7 300 net operated acres in q2 and an additional 10 955 in q3 we now operate 81 of our gas shale development and expect to add additional operated acreage in the remainder of 2008 as of july 30 2008 the company has 43 032 net operated acres including 38 455 acres of haynesville bossier shale giving us the most haynesville shale acres per share as compared to all other public companies the gmxr team continues to focus on the successful development of our asset base and executing our strategy of investing in profitable growth

1094111 people have some time off theres some pent up demand at that time of year more so than in the spring and you know if we can get open by thanksgiving it helps build momentum going into the christmas holiday period
1094112 thats because we do things a little differently here at talentdrive
1094113 its software on demand we have a very strong analytics package that separates us from the bunch plus we connect from a lot more locations than our competitors do
1094114 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
1094115 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
1094116 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
1094117 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
1094118 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
1094119 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
1094120 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
1094121 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
1094122 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
1094123 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
1094124 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
1094125 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
1094126 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
1094127 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
1094128 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
1094129 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
1094130 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
1094131 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
1094132 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
1094133 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
1094134 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
1094135 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
1094136 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
1094137 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
1094138 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
1094139 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
1094140 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
1094141 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
1094142 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
1094143 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
1094144 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
1094145 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
1094146 oh i know for sure were not alone in the universe
1094147 theres more nonsense out there about this than is real but it is a real phenomenon some of us are privileged enough to have been briefed on some of it
1094148 were not alone in the universe we have been visited
1094149 i think were heading toward serious disclosure but i cant say how fast
1094150 public acceptance is increasing and disinformation seems to be decreasing
1094151 do others involved in the moon landings know about this
1094152 its pretty obvious that if it were hostile wed have been gone by now or could have been we had no defense if thats what their real intent was
1094153 youve seen some of the pictures little people that look strange to us pretty accurate
1094154 oh no theyre not knocking anybody off for that anymore
1094155 scientists and engineers might be the most devastated by the discovery of relatively superior creatures since these professions are most clearly associated with mastery of nature
1094156 evolution is not just an inert piece of theoretical science
1094157 the survivors resemble the winners of a lottery rather than creatures better designed than the unlucky majority who do not survive
1094158 even if the whole universe consisted of organic soup the chance of producing merely the basic enzymes of life by random processes without intelligent direction would be about 1 over a 1 with 40 000 zeros after it a probability too small to imagine
1094159 darwinian evolution is most unlikely to get even one polypeptide sequence right let alone the thousands on which living cells depend for survival
1094160 most scientists still cling to darwinism because of its grip on the educational system
1094161 every time i write a paper on the origin of life i swear i will never write another one because there is too much speculation running after too few facts
1094162 an honest man armed with the knowledge available to us now could only state that in some sense the origin of life appears to be almost a miracle
1094163 the real paradigm shift is to consider that the universe is a life producing nursery and that the genesis and evolution of life is not earth centered but rather is distributed among the stars of the galaxies
1094164 an existing paradigm has ceased to function adequately in the exploration of an aspect of nature
1094165 is declared invalid only if an alternative candidate is available to take its place

1094168 we dont have plans to call congress into session it wont make a difference if democratic leaders are unwilling to bring up a bill for an up down vote
1094169 since speaker pelosi has decided not to keep the house in session to allow this vote to take place we urge you to use the power vested in you by the constitution to convene an immediate energy special session of congress
1094170 consuelo a sexy latina interviews the last great assault a band going on warped tour part 3
1094171 what heartens me as i hear the speeches of the men and women gathered around me is that i know in my heart we are speaking and giving voice to the will of the overwhelming majority of the american people who want this congress to return to washington d c and give the american people more access to american oil
1094172 im absolutely confident that if this congress were brought back to washington d c and given an opportunity to vote on giving more access to the american people of american oil that there is a bipartisan majority in the congress that would pass that measure
1094173 democrats offered a real solution to high energy prices that would bring immediate relief within 10 days by forcing the president to free our oil from the nations stockpile
1094174 the republicans propose to give away public lands to big oil which will not immediately reduce the price at the pump and save americans only 2 cents 10 years from now this republican hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to reduce the price at the pump and promote energy independence
1094175 in my district youll see a lot of wind turbines
1094176 youll see a lot of activities in labs for research and development of biodiesel and other renewables and alternatives its poised to be one of the leading districts in the nation on renewables
1094177 but what youll also see is a lot of oil and gas activity especially in weld county where theres great agriculture going on and yet a lot of exploration
1094178 meanwhile most of their republican colleagues returned home burdened with trying to explain why they blocked efforts to combat high gas prices
1094179 republicans voted against expanding drilling in alaska against promoting renewable energy against establishing the first new vehicle efficiency standards in 32 years against repealing taxpayer subsidies for major oil companies that are making record profits against cracking down on price gouging and against curbing excessive speculation in energy markets
1094180 for six years republicans controlled every branch of government and did nothing while america became more dependent on foreign sources of oil
1094181 i loaded up the minivan with our four children just like the griswolds and we drove through the night
1094182 you sense the change that is happening in the debate
1094183 you sense the change that the presumptive nominee of the democratic party senator obama is beginning to see the light on this and we welcome him to see the light on this
1094184 i think if we can continue to push continue to push continue to push then ultimately the american people are going to be winners

1094194 its one thing for a conservative to admire t r s style and gallantry the charge up san juan hill the rounding up of crooks in the badlands its something else for a conservative to identify roosevelt as a fellow reformer as sen mccain did in the times interview far from allaying conservative fears mccain can only add to them by trying to make a conservative of a man who largely for reasons of expediency embraced a host of dubious reforms and who ended his public career by embracing the progressive dream of a state strong enough to command the industry and commerce of the nation

1094217 we are hard pressed to imagine a better candidate than dr jha and believe that his appointment is a significant positive catalyst for motorolas shares
1094218 quilts connect just as they are made by connecting bits of fabric and thread the finished product also connects the quilter to people places and emotions in myriad ways
1094219 as early as you can find out what you like to do and then you dont really have to work
1094220 the necessary measures will be taken if anyone is found to be at fault
1094221 none of the deaths were caused by a hospital infection
1094222 sen mccain believes this is so important that we do not politicize this debate during an election season
1094223 we were in a contentious primary that lasted a very very long time and was hard fought and very substantive that did not happen in a republican primary
1094224 hey even obamas campaign thinks the lack of specifics is understandable because the primaries were shorter for republicans
1094225 when they bought the system of course it wasnt defined for a setup like a community clinic
1094226 so there was a lot of additional costs like programming
1094227 we deal with a lot of changes here with state federal and even county regulations so in order to keep up we needed something that could provide a faster turnaround to meet those changes
1094228 i explained to him what open source software was that the codes are free theyre easy to modify and things like that and he actually bought into it he was really surprised to hear about it and so he asked me is there an open source solution for healthcare administration so around 2003 i researched the idea
1094229 but we got grants for different projects like chronic disease management and we were often allowed to incorporate overhead costs into those budgets so we would use those extra monies to develop the clearhealth system
1094230 operation samahan is particularly important to clearhealth because its an fqhc
1094231 they are representative of organizations with fewer resources that are generally on the front lines of the chronic disease crisis in this country their frugality is a good driver of efficiencies and innovations that have impacted the clearhealth system the proprietary systems out there typically focus on features to sell the software and keep organizations from being able to move or interoperate to support their lock in models working with samahan naturally led us to a model that builds features based on tangible benefits in real settings rather than just eye candy in a sales brochure
1094232 as the beta testers whatever clearhealth developed with other clinics was incorporated into our system as well the whole development project cost about 200 000 in total and we didnt have to contribute a penny were getting all these enhancements for free and as part of the deal i helped them start up certain features
1094233 we were able to cope with all the standard changes in billing really easily
1094234 in the meantime we had all these complaints from other clinics who were saying oh my gosh we havent gotten paid in six months because our software vendors are very slow in keeping up with these changes we were so glad that we got out of that system
1094235 were already in the thick of developing the emr side into our system you cant find any system right now at this cost that can give you full emr capability as well as pms so what will happen with these clinics that have only pms on proprietary software is that theyll have to ditch whatever they have now and move to a new system so its more expensive
1094236 were actually in the process of establishing a separate entity of operation samahan that will offer technical services to other clinics
1094237 in fact were already supporting another clinic thats twice our size for their technical needs with my knowledge of megawest i can help them but theyre on the verge of changing their system and theyre looking very hard at their options are they going to a proprietary system that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars we can help them compare the system we have and with all these features to a proprietary system thats five times the cost just to acquire it
1094238 were getting a one week turnaround with our claims now with megawest we would see a two to three week turnaround community clinics dont have that big reserve and one week of delayed payments can cripple your company because thats your bottom line
1094239 at some point the staff were reluctant but then they saw the system
1094240 megawest is actually text based so its all command line driven so i had older staff members who werent very familiar with the mouse and they were saying well i dont know how to use this because its all a graphical interface its not so much open source or proprietary because they dont really know the difference they just see whats on the screen when i showed them clearhealth which is web based the younger staff got it it was zero training for them because theyre very familiar with the internet with the older staff it was just a matter of getting used to the mouse
1094241 we are working very diligently to focus all available federal resources on the problem of violent crime
1094242 while local law enforcement bears the burden of investigating and prosecuting the majority of gang related crimes particularly those involving juveniles federal law enforcement is actively involved in this effort
1094243 jennys plight grabbed my heart because after spending most of her life in captivity she finally has a chance to live a life much closer to what nature intended for her
1094244 i strongly urge the city of dallas to do the right thing and give jenny the life she deserves at the elephant sanctuary
1094245 there is no usda regulation limited roaming space and most significantly has no other african elephants
1094246 we should restore our position in cuba and other countries
1094247 we agreed on the priority for the direction of cooperation energy mining agriculture transport health care and communications
1094248 it is not a secret that the west is creating a buffer zone around russia involving countries in central europe the caucasus the baltic states and ukraine
1094249 in response we may expand our military presence abroad including in cuba
1094250 emerging markets are a major factor in driving worldwide semiconductor sales
1094251 rapid price declines for microchips tend to mask the real growth of the industry
1094252 the cost of 1 gigabit of dram has declined by 43 percent during the past year while the price of 2 gigabits of nand flash has declined by 61 percent in the last 12 months
1094253 it doesnt matter if youre joe the milkman or whoever
1094254 regardless of whether you go to the super bowl or not youve got to learn from your mistakes youll get punished for them
1094255 no one wants to go to jail but like i said youve got to learn from your mistakes you get punished for them i did what i had to do just to get through this
1094256 it should be over with after the second 30 days all of this comes from the juvenile thing
1094257 i went to court about it and thats just what was said
1094258 of course its always going to be in the back of your head
1094259 with me when im on the field im in another mind state and i just go out there and play my game
1094260 wie panne ist das denn die bersetzen sogar den dummen namen naja also im vergleich zu meinem ehemaligen
1094261 but in general i can tell you this nickel and dime stuff doesnt work
1094262 to make dvrs available to many more people faster and less expensively than would otherwise be possible
1094263 for cable it potentially means much lower capital spending going forward
1094264 no longer need to provide piece of hardware i e a dvr for each individual subscriber in order to offer dvr functionality
1094265 dawn op ed the isi and an sos by cyril almeida
1094266 i dont believe that the doha round is yet a failure
1094267 i think there were difficulties and in that difficulty it was better to stop to reflect how to continue
1094268 i was very clear with bush that it is not possible that two countries as important as the united states and india which are negotiating a nuclear agreement cant find the conditions to make a deal on the issue of food because there is very little remaining differences between them
1094269 it seems practically impossible to conclude negotiations before the end of the year
1094270 the biggest risk for hsbc is not what they paid but the character of the business theyre buying

1094273 bernie mac is still alive and being treated in a chicago hospital for pneumonia and is expected to make a full recovery we once again ask that the press respect his privacy and that of his family
1094274 we never anticipated such a severe reaction to the word
1094275 says jag jaegar co owner of jv games which released
1094276 although we understand that 21 is the legal drinking age we dont want our students participating in activities that could do excessive harm to themselves or others
1094277 i know that water pong seems like a good balance between the dartmouth drinking culture and just trying to have fun
1094278 however it can be just as dangerous if not more so
1094279 have access to alcohol they will create drinking games out of any activity
1094280 you cant drink if youre not 21 but that does not seem to have deterred students in any way
1094281 to do the same thing with a campus ban we know its not working
1094282 foul language rowdy and disorderly behavior and to examples of the consumption of alcohol under circumstances that are detrimental
1094283 like when youre late for the bus chasing it down

1094287 the arizona republican senator wants to reduce the federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent as an incentive to keep jobs
1094288 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets now big oils filling john mccains campaign with 2 million in contributions because instead of taxing their windfall profits to help drivers mccain wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another barack obama a windfall profits tax on big oil to give families a 1 000 rebate a president wholl stand up for you

1094292 stelica stai deoparte sau da ti demisia basescu a fost informat ca onaca este singurul care se poate bate cu mazare cj constanta nu ne intereseaza
1094293 basescu si tariceanu au in interiorul lor ceva impotriva tiganetului dar nu o recunosc
1094294 am decis sa trec din categoria diagnosticieni in partea cealalta a terapeutilor
1094295 mi se pare hazlie declaratia domnului stolojan eu sunt inca membru al pd l dar nu voi mai candida vreodata din partea acestui partid iar deocamdata nu mi am anuntat oficial nicio candidatura din postura de independent
1094296 pe data de 7 aprilie emil boc impreuna cu gheorghe flutur si adrian videanu in birou mi a spus
1094297 stelica stai deoparte asta e intelegerea presedintelui i s au prezentat mai multe informari din care reiese ca dumitru onaca este singurul care se poate bate cu radu mazare probabil dupa aceasta emisiune voi fi dat afara din partid
1094298 de orice as putea fi acuzat dar de blaturi cu psd ul nu daca domnul emil boc e barbat sa vina sa probeze celor afirmate ce face domnul boc acum este nedemn si josnic
1094299 we were frustrated that most online info about restaurants is out of date obviously sponsored or the opinion of some food critic that is hard to relate to but friends always have a wealth of information on where to go where not to go and the latest hot spots or best kept secrets
1094300 eat a rama unlocks this potential by combining social networking with all the great stuff friends know about where to eat
1094301 activestate is quickly becoming a leader in social networking technologies with applications that provide real utility to real users
1094302 eat a rama is another example of how activestate is fulfilling the potential of social networking to make technology that just works
1094303 activestate was built on open source and were excited to be giving back by adding komodo edit to the open source software community
1094304 komodo edit users can now benefit from all the features that open source implies usage flexibility community development and increased innovation as well as the support of activestate
1094305 komodo ide now has the best find and replace system of any editor
1094306 with a fast and simple means to find code snippets and make global code changes plus a preview and an undo to make it safe komodo ide makes it easier for developers to navigate their work and adjustments quickly
1094307 i have been using komodo ide 4 3 and have been very impressed with it
1094308 i mainly use it with tcl tk and fortran probably regarded as a little off the beaten track support for the new version of tcl 8 5 is now very good i would recommend without reservation komodo ide to anyone developing in a scripting language
1094309 as a programming languages addict and a scripting guy by heart i really love komodo
1094310 i use it to write python perl and ruby scripts
1094311 in japan idtvs already displace about 1 7 million satellite set top box shipments each year having reduced that market from 2 million unit shipments in 2003 to just 0 3 million in 2007 while the conditions in japan that allow this are unique it is clear that us cable operators are working towards the creation of an even more compelling situation in the hopes of eliminating most of the 200 cost of a dvr
1094312 this specification might have certain additional requirements on character encodings image formats audio formats and video formats in the respective sections
1094313 it would be helpful for interoperability if all browsers could support the same codecs however there are no known codecs that satisfy all the current players we need a codec that is known to not require per unit or per distributor licensing that is compatible with the open source development model that is of sufficient quality as to be usable and that is not an additional submarine patent risk for large companies
1094314 if you dont revert you will be giving us independent authors the shaft and we will remember it forever
1094315 there are unimplemented bits bugs etc that need to be sorted out but its a start towards using a common codec across all platforms and will improve as we get towards the 3 1 release
1094316 i suspect that the effects of this will take a long while to be felt but its a great first step in bringing open video to the web by delivering it to a couple hundred million people around the world
1094317 yet i could pick up photoshop 5 5 probably even newer versions and without reading through a manual find the few things i want to do and do them
1094318 with fuel prices at record levels the timing couldnt be better
1094319 replacing our old recycled pillows and blankets is a health conscious and consumer conscious decision
1094320 we are pleased to release a faster smarter and more powerful version of activetcl
1094321 developers will benefit from new core support for arbitrary precision integers a new theming engine and widgets and numerous other changes to better integrate existing language features in more cohesive ways
1094322 dmailer backup is simple data loss prevention at its best
1094323 clifton hill is a famous landmark right dead centre of all the tourist activity in niagara falls
1094324 the picture on the album cover was taken there back around the mid eighties when it was still a kind of cheesy tourist trap and we wanted to show that side of it we of course see the whole thing differently than the millions of tourists who visit there every year the picture is also cool because we shot our burning in love video there in the early 80s and thats just what it looked like then
1094325 every time johnnie dee vocals guitar and i sit down to write a record the sound does progress because we have lived a lot more of life than when we were all kids we never say the new songs are going to sound like this or that but this whole new album has really been somewhat of a return musically to the sound that we had in the 80s its produced by tom treumuth who did our first record so it seems weve all come full circle hence the title clifton hill
1094326 the death of alexander isayevich solzhenitsyn is a heavy loss for the whole of russia
1094327 he was one of the first people who spoke up about the inhumanity of stalins regime with a full voice and about the people who lived through this but were not broken
1094328 its a great loss for our family its also a loss for the country
1094329 he was always really happy he returned this is his home
1094330 of course people were afraid to fill out the petition because they were worried about being picked up by the security services and beaten
1094331 but when we explained to them that this was necessary for the republic in most cases they signed the petition

1094334 sen mccain is supporting the same tax policies that have been supported by president bush
1094335 what i am asking is does john mccain have the
1094336 its just not taxes recently the subject came up of al gores assertion that the u

1094338 larry has every intention of calling the georgia home games this season and is ready for the football season to begin
1094339 the munson family wishes to personally thank all the doctors nurses and therapists at st marys hospital the shepherd center and athens regional who have worked very hard to help larry make a full recovery
1094340 the family would also like to thank his employer cox radio and the university of georgia for being so understanding at such a crucial time in larrys life thanks again to all the fans that sent cards and letters wishing larry well
1094341 tony franklin offensive coordinator auburn with alabama the hot resurgent sec west program lsu coming off a national title at ole miss and arkansas coming up with splashy coaching changes auburn is working to make sure it doesnt get lapped with the change to the spread offense the spotlight will be on franklin to make the tiger attack work right now theres no grace period
1094342 keep track of any number of time zones at once
1094343 he has all the tools to be as good as he wants to be as good as this conference has ever seen
1094344 before its over these two guys might be two of the better ones to walk in the door
1094345 those two guys are getting a lot of praise from our veteran receivers and our veteran defensive backs
1094346 were going to give them an opportunity to see what we can do
1094347 hes like my little brother anything that he needs he knows he can come to me
1094348 one of the things i wanted to do is play him to the field to give him an opportunity to operate in space and not be confined
1094349 if hes progressing like i think hes going to progress
1094350 the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time
1094351 for me its just good to be anywhere every year
1094352 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1094353 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1094354 this transformation will be costly and given the fiscal disaster we will inherit from the last administration it will likely require us to defer some other priorities
1094355 like all compromises this one has its drawbacks it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1094356 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1094357 like george bush and dick cheney before him he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than 1 million from big oil just last month
1094358 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1094359 a windfall profits tax on big oil to give families a thousand dollar rebate
1094360 it was sen obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
1094361 as in the desert where they have lots of mirages aka where i grew up the new os performed very well and impressed the test group more than expected
1094362 exchanged into local currency that is instantly recognised trusted and circulated
1094363 the itf is very disappointed with the decision and feels that the precedent set today could ultimately harm the rights of international federations to set qualification criteria and puts the role of the international federation in the olympic games into discussion
1094364 it is very disturbing for the itf and should be for the ioc when players who do not meet the itf qualification criteria approved by the ioc are entered at the expense of players who qualified and deserve to represent their countries at the 2008 olympic games
1094365 fis takes note of the result and reiterates its complete shock at a controversy that involves an athlete that has always been distinguished for his sportsmanship and correctness
1094366 the surprise is even greater given that baldini like all the other top level fencers in the italian national team has repeatedly undergone tests during the course of the season that have always been negative
1094367 doping does not exist in fencing it has no sense
1094368 i dont feel sorry for myself im not going to cry victim
1094369 im a moving part on this team i do not encapsulate the whole i am a part without all of the moving parts the bus moves a little bit different but i know the team that will be fielded for china is going to be a great team
1094370 theres no doubt in my heart no doubt in my mind no doubt in my soul this team can win a gold medal
1094371 i am confident that the team will respond step up and bring the best out of each other
1094372 no one can replace abby so we will change the attacking style a little bit but we have been able to adjust the way weve played at several points during this year
1094373 our players are very brave so i think all of us will take this challenge and make the best out of it its a privilege to play under pressure and we like that
1094374 die modellrechnungen belegen dass die wahrscheinlichkeit ein unternehmen zu gr nden in hohem ma e durch das geschlecht und die ausbildung der erwerbspersonen beeinflusst wird daneben spielt auch das alter eine ma gebliche rolle an diesen drei faktoren muss also gedreht werden um auch in zukunft ein vitales gr ndungsgeschehen zu gew hrleisten
1094375 im moment ist eigentlich alles interessant was mit mobiltelefonen zu tun hat
1094376 die strategie die vielzahl hochwertiger hochschulerfindungen aus dem ganzen bundesgebiet zu b ndeln und interessierten unternehmen einen zentralen zugang zu bieten bew hrt sich
1094377 i dont look at myself as being 36 and i certainly dont feel 36
1094378 for me its more about the mentality so i think i have a little more upstairs as far as experience that will help me
1094379 when it comes down to it it really is all about how you play on the field and being a part of this team regardless of what age you are is a great honor
1094380 it feels great its such an honor to be part of the team
1094381 its a big competition the world will be watching and its just a chance to represent my country its going to be a lot of fun
1094382 i think were all aware of that but i dont think we can change it at this point
1094383 its just up to us to get ourselves ready and to put our best foot forward and make sure that when the first game comes around that were ready to go the excitement of the olympics and of being a part of something like this will certainly help get us all ready to go
1094384 what an exciting group of young men and women that are going to be representing our country in beijing
1094385 there is no doubt that this is going to be a very strong team because they believe in the magic that theyve been able to capture here and theyre going to take to beijing
1094386 i still dont think im going to have a lot of pressure on me even though i ran that time
1094387 regardless it was wind aided so when we go to the next big race hes bolt still going to be the world record holder
1094388 i see myself as an average person and i try to just do my best and do my job
1094389 i have to be calm to be able to face the pressure i dont see myself as a superstar thats how i deal with it
1094390 theyre certainly the favorite to win the 2008 olympics in sheer talent theyre the best team
1094391 whether they become the very best team on the floor that remains to be seen but they certainly have as good a shot if not better than anybody there
1094392 i think the thing that is special about this team is that it has been a three year commitment
1094393 its not just about this year but its about what weve done in the past to get to this point
1094394 were hungry i think we have a team of guys who are hungry enough to satisfy coach ks code of basketball
1094395 the more the game went along the more comfortable they became we got a commitment to protect each others back
1094396 the americans are quick theyre talented and once they get out and start running and knock down a few shots it becomes very very difficult
1094397 the biggest thing we can do is go and show the best softball theyve ever seen
1094398 if we put on the best show theyve ever seen than we can prove softball should remain in the olympics
1094399 it is a very exciting time as we are embarking on our last leg of the tour
1094400 the sites have been great we are going to be extremely focused the next month to get ready to defend our gold medal come august in china
1094401 we had our backs up against the wall and we responded i wasnt overly pleased but we showed that we can be explosive and score runs when we need to
1094402 its a week of competition thats come to a close and now we have a month to prepare for the olympics hopefully we can come back in another month and prove the u s is the best team in the world
1094403 i know ive made it but i havent read any articles or seen anything on tv
1094404 the comeback kind of blew me away when she was so successful last summer breaking the american record
1094405 once she did that i knew she was going to make the team
1094406 it only hit me after i had given birth and was swimming fast
1094407 there were about 5 000 swimmers there and it felt like 5 000 people said to me id love to see you go for another olympics even going into that meet i had no interest i was still breast feeding between events
1094408 not a lot of people expected me make this team
1094409 i knew i could make the team but it was a long shot
1094410 its definitely challenging both mentally and physically but having done it once now gives me the confidence to do it again
1094411 we simply havent had practice time together weve trained different players at different times well have to form that chemistry quickly
1094412 but we already have players and coaches who understand what it takes to win i really think we can come back with a gold medal
1094413 we have great chemistry we understand the target is on our back
1094414 i saw the magnitude of what its about in 2004
1094415 ive been playing usa basketball since high school and as long as i have the chance ill be ready to play
1094416 while we arent able to prepare the 12 member team together at least everybody has had the chance to work with the head coach understand the strategy and have some sort of evaluation process
1094417 its a team sport so i look at more of the team record than the individual the individual is nice but i never would have gotten there had it not been for holly mcpeak and kerri
1094418 she deserves every award shes ever received congratulations to her for all her hard work shes changed the game
1094419 were a really good team and theyre a great team great teams make the plays when it matters like that
1094420 we have to find a way to make great plays two sets or three sets together nicole and i have pushed them in every single final weve played against them its made us a better team and its making them a better team i just want to win some of these
1094421 i am overly elated to be selected to my fourth olympic games
1094422 it was an emotional moment for all of us though to be selected coach jenny lang ping called us in by groups to tell us who was selected it was an awesome moment when my name was called
1094423 russia and serbia were not at the world grand prix but in the finals there were six teams qualified for the olympic games three of which we will play in our pool
1094424 we are pretty close except brazil dominated the world grand prix
1094425 i dont think every team put forth their best lineup in every match as teams tried to evaluate different players i think we played better each week especially in the fourth week our physical conditioning was a little tired and that made it a little harder for the players we still had our goals and worked hard especially to play more consistently
1094426 benefited the lives of families and individuals across the united states and around the world
1094427 it is disgraceful that senators would consider congratulating james dobson for his reprehensible radio broadcasts that damage families and promote discrimination
1094428 honoring a man who distorts research and misrepresents facts sends the wrong message to youth who are looking for role models do we really want young people to think lying and cheating are acceptable ways to promote a viewpoint
1094429 what dr dobson has done through the years is look at scientific data and then reach conclusions off that data that may or may not be supported by the researchers who did the research
1094430 i would agree with schneeberger that dobson is committing larceny of the lab by twisting the scientific conclusions of legitimate researchers to fit his archaic views
1094431 however it is neither moral nor ethical to cherry pick work and grossly misrepresent research to bolter an ideological agenda
1094432 anything but straight unmasking the scandals and lies behind the ex gay myth

1094722 i just have this feeling that either trophies are going to be soooo amazing that they will overturn sonys fate or that home will finally release and be something that will be a decision maker for some buyers or maybe there will actually be something that sony will one day announce and then soon after release that will blow everyone out of the water whatever it is they cant announce it until its almost done b c i dont think they can afford to make more promises of things to come

1094767 if you had told me four years ago that a democratic presidential candidate would be running a competitive race in virginia and would open 10 offices i would say that is spectacular
1094768 now we have a guy who has opened 20 to 30 offices around the state youve got to be kidding me
1094769 we have traditionally been the party who can get their people to the polls when its a presidential race
1094770 even in 1996 when bill clinton was winning every state imaginable bob dole won virginia because our people showed up

1094796 it is important as an athlete to be selfish but a lot of my friends are competing out there and my girlfriend is doing the pole vault
1094797 shes very level headed and if anything will keep me on the ground and make sure i do what im capable of and do well
1094798 we are both selfish in the sense we both know whats best for ourselves and were fortunate that were in a relationship where we understand what each other have to do
1094799 my heats are on the same day as her final but thats fine
1094800 to run sub 45 is a massive step in the right direction and ive just got to build on it now ill be disappointed if i dont make the final and when im there anything can happen
1094801 i want to emulate anyone who has an olympic medal it doesnt matter who they are they all trained hard and thats what i aspire to be like
1094802 obviously theres roger black iwan thomas jamie baulch guys who ran 44s for fun so i want to be at least at the same level as they were
1094803 ive now just got to look after my body and make sure i stay healthy and not do anything stupid
1094804 when i did the kit pick up for the olympics that was quite a big thing for me as i realised i was becoming an olympian im very excited
1094805 ive been to beijing before in 2006 for the world juniors and i really didnt get to see too much of it other than my hotel room and the track
1094806 hopefully this time i will see the great wall and tiananmen square which would be great
1094807 i would love to see some of the boxing and lots of other sports like hockey and swimming i want to see them do well and hopefully ill get that chance
1094808 although ill make sure it doesnt get in the way of my own warm ups and preparations for my event id love to get involved with the olympic experience
1094809 andrew steele has been running back into form after his injuries and weve also got michael bingham and a crop of youngsters coming through
1094810 anything can happen in the relay last year the polish team medalled and on paper they didnt deserve to weve got to put ourselves in the medal position and i know i can run 43s in the relay
1094811 the situation has not changed tottenham offered us 15 8m for andrei but that does not work for us we are waiting for a new proposal
1094812 the bit im looking forward to most is also the bit im dreading most stepping out onto the track in the stadium its going to be amazing but i dont know what to expect
1094813 you see it on tv and read about it i just dont know how ill react hopefully it will be in a good way and i can run well i think it will sink in a lot more when im there and realise the full scale of the operation
1094814 at the moment im just excited and heading into the unknown of whats going to happen out there
1094815 im going to try and not worry about the stage its on and approach it the same way i do every race
1094816 i try not to over analyses things and just go out there and do my job and thats what im going to do in beijing
1094817 first of all im focusing on the first race and getting out of the heats i think anything else after that will be a massive bonus
1094818 im capable of reaching the final but it will take a couple of great runs from me and a bit of luck if i can get myself there then anything can happen id definitely like to make that final my best is good enough to be there
1094819 ive proved my worth in the team and have run consistently all year and if i go out there and do my best then nobody can ask anymore thats all im trying to do
1094820 theres a lot of people who are capable of getting medals that not many have predicted im an outside shot at getting a medal but noone has mentioned me in that way
1094821 so there will be a few surprises and hopefully all good ones
1094822 its nice to be going out there with andy in the same event and im sure we can help each other out a lot
1094823 ive been out in america for a few years and its very much a team orientated thing at university there and it definitely helps a lot
1094824 during my time in athletics definitely hicham el guerrouj has been a massive influence in middle distance running i watched him win the double 1 500m and 5k in the olympics and that was a big inspirational moment for me
1094825 and of course the british history is very strong and that pushes me on a bit
1094826 since the trials ive received so much support from relatives and friends all brought together by what im doing

1094905 they are environmental nightmares and they need to be addressed
1094906 its just a very sad day that were moving in the opposite direction
1094907 if we could re organize the environment we could do a lot to help society

1094922 the image of the limousines that became grand pianos stuck with me
1094923 and of course its absurdity was part of the generating idea of this piece called grand pianola music
1094924 and my dad had at the end of his life suffered from alzheimers disease and became in one of the very poignant and strangely comical moments that often happen to alzheimers my father had become obsessed with the clarinet
1094925 and he did funny strange things with it one time my mother was emptying out a load of laundry into the washing machine and she heard this strange noise and looked and saw that my father had taken the clarinet apart piece by piece and hid it in the dirty laundry and somehow this suggested a strange slightly berserk piece that had both charm and humor but also a certain personal poignance
1094926 of course hoe down is supposed to be about horses
1094927 but since i was writing this piece for a very great english clarinet player michael collins and the london sinfonietta and it was shortly after the mad cow disease scare i decided to dedicate this to my english friends and make it a hoe down for a mad cow
1094928 and then into this came me with this strange kind of p t barnum of a piece that didnt even have strings in it
1094929 it was just basically for wind band and two pianos and these three cooing sopranos that never said anything they just kind of cooed like the sirens in homers odyssey you know its a piece with a sense of humor and it also has a little liberace a little beethoven a little ray charles
1094930 so when i went up to take a bow i stood next to one of the pianists this very lovely and much adored pianist ursula oppens and i heard the booing and i was just you know very disturbed

1094968 basically i got a lot of stuff on my album thats not that simple its just basically a way to calm things down
1094969 heartbreaker differs from past records in that its much more dark and much more romantic
1094970 its is a complete thought with different dynamics and moods
1094971 the dark romantics first album was a collection of older songs from other projects and new songs that we wrote on our own and then brought into the studio
1094972 this time dean and i wrote together from start to finish we were completely honest with each other for the sake of the song and it worked out well
1094973 we went through a time of depression before starting the dark romantics because we werent doing what we love we make music because we have to
1094974 i read to my kids every night when im not on tour and understand the importance of reading to children it will be a thrill to have my own book to read to my kids at night this is also a great way to introduce children to sister hazel through a bedtime story our fans are becoming parents now and this song has always been a fan favorite especially among children

1094984 the governor understands this is difficult but there are no easy decisions in this situation
1094985 we are facing a 15 2 billion deficit the state has no rainy day fund and the legislature is eight weeks late in delivering a budget it is the governors responsibility to ensure the state does not run out of cash and can pay its bills there are no easy decisions in light of the situation
1094986 our performance reflects the growing momentum behind this company after two years of repositioning our brand and reinventing the guest experience
1094987 while we still have a considerable portion of our season in front of us im encouraged by the results especially in the current economic climate
1094988 the los angeles county animal shelter system is supposed to provide a reasonable safety net of care for lost and abandoned animals
1094989 instead the system betrays the trust of the citizens of los angeles county by failing to treat the animals humanely and kindly
1094990 los angeles county and its department of animal control fought the existing animal protection laws that safeguard shelter animals when those laws were pending in the legislature they fought the laws after they became effective through a regulatory challenge now it appears they have decided they are just going to ignore those laws
1094991 but los angeles county shelters are supposed to enforce laws related to animal welfare not violate the laws themselves and then retaliate against rescue groups who want to save these animals and make their demands public this is the worst form of hypocrisy and cannot be tolerated especially since animals are not only suffering they are needlessly being killed because of it
1094992 i have tried to work with the department and director mayeda regarding the conditions at los angeles county shelters for many months to no avail
1094993 i cannot sit quietly and do nothing about this and have no choice at this point but to demand that they follow the law
1094994 as a taxpayer i dont want my taxes to pay for the killing of animals when there are rescue groups willing to save them at their own expense
1094995 these shelters also do not reflect my values and those of my fellow citizens who love animals since they are supposed to be working for us i want them caring for animals humanely thats the law and those are the values a majority of us hold dear
1094996 implement human and christian values including sharing reflection dialogue and living together which are closely linked to the groups own philosophy
1094997 its not surprising then that they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigration sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
1094998 the dcia innovators award is presented annually to that company which epitomizes the overall advancement of distributed computing technologies for commercial purposes
1094999 pando networks through its leadership role in the p4p working group has engaged internet service providers isps in the deployment of p2p related technologies pando has also been a leader in educating content owners about the benefits of distributed computing with the development of the pando content delivery suite commercial content owners everywhere can now seamlessly add secure peer assisted delivery to their existing content delivery networks cdns

1095003 cause ya know if tammy did actually do time then she might be elevated to the status of super martyr
1095004 i know ddb loves dogs and does not support spaying and neutering pets out of existence
1095005 i think that if spay neuter were worked properly we would get to the point where dogs were so valued that it would cost you you know a good few hundred dollars to have a dog and they would be so valued and treated great and then you know more breeding could be brought back into play
1095006 dogs deserve better does not support bsl lets just make that perfectly clear here ddb does not support bsl
1095007 anyone who cares about animals would have done exactly what tammy did
1095008 so many people have taken it upon themselves because of our website
1095009 so how could an anti tethering law have a negative impact on responsible dog owners who are already doing the right thing
1095010 uh i think that people who are responsible dont want their rights taken away which i understand by us keeping our rights we give the people who are irresponsible the right to continue the problem
1095011 the only reason tammy was convicted is because the judge refused to allow the jury to consider the defense of justification
1095012 as far as a dog in a fence being bored and frustrated yes that may happen but to have room to run to decide where to lay by the door or under the tree
1095013 there are laws on the books to protect dogs from exposure neglect and abuse i will categorically state that i am against dogs being tied up day in day out im sure we all are however a dog can be as lonely and sad in a yard behind a fence is that next no fences no leashes get real
1095014 dont worry everytings 0k im just climbin crost ur windowz
1095015 there is evidence that hatred of our religion was the motivation in part at least
1095016 they keep claiming that this property is theirs and it is not theirs

1095024 rae did a phenomenal job with her team in having them playing their best basketball at the right time of the season
1095025 they were good all season long but they got on a roll and really did a great job representing this university with my background as a womens basketball coach and having done that for the first time at texas a amp m i know how special it is to make the big dance
1095026 coach corbett and his staff have just done an outstanding job of building a program from the ground up the right way
1095027 theyve established a base where our expectations are that every year we are going to be successful which is great situation to be in theyre just going to keep getting better
1095028 what aaron fox has accomplished as young as he is is amazing
1095029 he took over a program that was not in good shape and has turned it into a powerhouse its been gratifying to watch him build a champion
1095030 of the nine years ive been here this may be the most significant year that weve really ever had
1095031 from the students overwhelmingly passing the referendum to our teams competing at the highest level and winning the commissioners cup we really pulled off some amazing things we wont be satisfied though we want to win the cup every year and we always want our student athletes to succeed athletically academically and socially
1095032 to see if there really as an incursion or not
1095033 i think that selfish aspect is overplayed he kevin pietersen would probably admit in his youth he was a bit like that but i dont think he is like that so much now
1095034 the selectors had a decision to make they spoke long and hard about which direction they wanted to go in
1095035 if they wanted a captain for all three formats including twenty20 the list would have been short im not involved in two of the formats and alastair cook hasnt been in the twenty20 side recently i would have liked to have done the test job and to that degree i am disappointed i have not been given the opportunity
1095036 you only had to see how much it meant to michael vaughan yesterday to realise it is an encompassing job
1095037 it is a brave decision because kp pietersen hasnt done much captaincy before but i think he has matured a lot in the last couple of years
1095038 it is going to be a massive job he will have an abundance of confidence to believe he can do it and he will have the full support of all the players around him
1095039 kp is a very decisive person and i am sure he will feel he is up to the challenge
1095040 the one thing i would say about kevin is everything he has done in his career so far he has easily stepped up to the mark and found a way to deal with it he is an exceptional batsman and it would take quite a lot for something external to affect his batting
1095041 hes also not shy of making the big decisions those big decisions are not going to affect that style of guy
1095042 he hasnt done too much captaining before so it will be interesting but all i know is he has the support of everyone
1095043 we are delighted with the progress our umpires are making in world cricket
1095044 in retaining the same panels we feel that transfer of skills initiative put in place last season will sustain us for the future this is an ongoing process and will continue
1095045 the overall performance of the umpires was of a very high standard during the past season thus enabling the players to enjoy the game
1095046 they the dup and sinn fein really ought to consult with us before they spin about us
1095047 i think there is this idea that they can rely on us to ride to the rescue well they cant expect that when they havent spoken to us on the issue for the last 16 months
1095048 war dance of the hand maidens of the oil companies
1095049 this is her dilemma i am trying to save the planet i am trying to save the planet she wants the planet restored to some imagined state of being she says she wants to save the planet but doesnt show concern for the homo sapiens that live on it she doesnt want our standard of living to go up she doesnt want more energy we might as well backtrack and start at the garden of eden

1095057 i run a team in partnership with red bull and shouldnt mix personal things with business
1095058 but if bruno is clearly the best candidate then well discuss it anyway if hes gp2 champion it doesnt matter what his name is
1095059 she wanted me to see that he was making the right moves and i decided to help
1095060 he reminds me of ayrton hes very switched on very quick thinking
1095061 its good if people in f1 are starting to talk about me
1095062 but i have unfinished business in gp2 i think an f1 race seat would be more valuable to me than a back up role next year because i still have a lot to learn and you cant replicate all of that in testing
1095063 his speed is obvious but hes also incredibly bright driving the car uses only a small percentage of his mental capacity and thats typical of the really top guys
1095064 i hit some nice shots under pressure over the last few holes
1095065 the wedge into 17 was a lovely shot one of the best in ages and i hit a great drive down the last after vijay hit the middle of the fairway because you know youve got to hit the fairway there to give yourself a chance of a birdie
1095066 when i get into contention i feel very comfortable out there now nothing fazes me too much
1095067 im just delighted with the consistency i went three years without winning and then won twice within four weeks sometimes it goes your way and sometimes somebody else plays a bit better
1095068 respect campaign designed to tackle dissent among players representatives from the football league the professional footballers association the league managers association and the professional game match officials will also be present
1095069 we will be feeding into the public sector review and we have to get this right going forward what does the licence fee payer want there are 12 main sports on the bbc and for cricket not to be one of them shows there is a mismatch of priorities cricket fans are licence fee payers and we believe they deserve better from the government and the bbc
1095070 as head of sport i get lobbied a fair bit perfectly fairly people want to see their passions reflected on the bbcs airwaves and there are two areas that get mentioned a lot the first is cricket im repeatedly asked when itll be back on bbc screens to which all we can say is watch this space the rights will be tendered in the next year or so and weve said wed like to bid

1095145 they put me to bed but i woke up in the night and couldnt stand on my foot
1095146 by the morning my foot was like a red balloon and i had a red line all the way up inside my leg
1095147 i had to be rushed into emergency and couldnt walk on my foot for two days
1095148 doctors thought i might need antibiotics on an iv drip but in the end i had to have strong oral ones and could not put my foot down or run for four days
1095149 i was beginning to feel cursed i was thinking that somebody somewhere had a little doll and was sticking pins in it

1095163 with well over a dozen of the leading open source manufacturers participating our online configurator is the first of its kind it takes the complexity out of solution building so resellers can focus on selling it also helps the reseller realize net new revenue by suggesting complementary products to accompany a solution such as a voip sip firewall or a switching solution this presents an obvious sales margin advantage to the reseller
1095164 westcons configurator has enormous potential for resellers to expand their business in the open source market through collaborationpoint opensource and the new configuration tool westcon has demonstrated tremendous leadership in distributing open source solutions and are significantly lowering the barriers for resellers to compete and succeed
1095165 the biggest advantage westcons configurator delivers is the ability to put all the relevant third party products in a single place
1095166 when i run a solution through the configurator i know that all the products will plug and play together properly and that westcon will support it overall the time savings the configurator can offer is immeasurable especially when it comes to quote preparation

1095235 those who know me will know that i am not a coward i have never been afraid of anything i was willing to die for this country and i am prepared to die for it
1095236 even if he is in jail we will vote for him
1095237 expressed its disappointment at the lack of a clear response from iran
1095238 france understands that a written document must reach mr solana tomorrow august 5 and hopes that this document will contain the answer that the international community is waiting for
1095239 in the absence of a positive response to the six world powers iran will then have to face new sanctions
1095240 if we dont get an encouraging response from the iranians we will have to show firmness resort to sanctions as in the past
1095241 we will have no choice but to ask the un to proceed with further sanctions
1095242 israel decided to take the humanitarian decision to transfer to jericho 87 residents of the shujaiya neighbourhood in gaza because of the violence carried out by hamas
1095243 we talked with them on the bus and we told them that jericho and the west bank are different from the gaza strip and that the israeli army controls this region they have to respect the law
1095244 are mainly young people aged between 14 and 20 years who will remain in jericho indefinitely their families will not be allowed to join them
1095245 received information that they were being arrested by hamas and that their lives were in immediate danger
1095246 we never wanted anyone to leave in this regrettable way
1095247 this is a path that does harm to them because by the mere act of fleeing a person places himself in the realm of suspicion
1095248 we condemn the criminal acts undertaken by the hamas leadership against the palestinian people in shujaiya in gaza
1095249 45 years gone by pretty fast like smoke through a keyhole
1095250 al qaeda had huge aims and aimed to literally take down the west to kill thousands and they have to create economic havoc and they have and they needed enthusiastic uncontrollably enthusiastic warriors like that accused right there salim hamdan
1095251 mr hamdan is not an al qaeda warrior he is not last line of defence
1095252 hamdan had no previous knowledge of the operation or any other one
1095253 he is fit to change trucks tyres change oil filters wash and clean cars
1095254 this is one of the worst incidents in the history of k2 climbing
1095255 given the forecast for tropical storm edouard shell will begin limited evacuations of approximately 40 personnel from some of its gulf of mexico west operations area today monday
1095256 no further evacuations are planned at this time and based on current information and forecast we do not expect any impact on shell operated production in the gulf of mexico
1095257 based on the damage to the bus it could have been a whole lot worse
1095258 you could have had a catastrophe with 30 people on that bus

1095305 you should see what i look like after a rangers loss
1095306 i went on a troll hunt cross steal home and hurlerhurley off the list
1095307 david murphy is the 2nd best rangers since he has the 2nd most rbis on the team
1095308 i told daddy that all the lsbers know more about baseball than him
1095309 i think john daniels and donnie nelson are the two greatest gms in all of sports
1095310 well the dallas mavericks got beat by the new orleans hornets last night ending their season word is that someone on the team is dating jessica simpson
1095311 i towld daddy that o p s pwus is overwated
1095312 the other kid cant get out of his stroller and is banned from day care for a year uncle ben told me how to drop kick him in the nuts and it worked
1095313 whatsoever you do do it heartily as unto the lord
1095314 how do i know what i think until i see what i say
1095315 cant guarantee jobs but we help our students with resume writing and leads for jobs they can come back any time its a lifetime service
1095316 i could never get a job in a medical office not even doing the filing
1095317 they told me i have to have a certificate or a degree the only girls getting jobs were the ones who were bilingual but they never told me that beforehand
1095318 we are readily available to assist any graduate in good standing
1095319 successful job search is dependent upon a self confident and well prepared applicant with a pre planned strategy
1095320 students need to step up be responsible and make sure they take a hard look at what theyre getting themselves into
1095321 they need to make thoughtful decisions especially before they enter into any financial contract
1095322 were pretty confident well get a bill to the governor but we dont know if hes going to sign it
1095323 is very proud of the fantastic results achieved by its ultrasound sonography program graduates
1095324 seventy percent of the 2007 graduates were placed in great sonography careers
1095325 the salaries theyre earning are also great the average annual salary of the graduates was 45 760 and some graduates have earned as a starting annual salary 60 320
1095326 you want to take a quality program so you get the training you need to pass the exam
1095327 we tell people to look for program level accreditation by an agency like the american medical association
1095328 i didnt even know what half those things were on the test
1095329 schools like any other commercial enterprise will say a lot of things but are there really jobs making that much money call around to employers and ask about the starting pay and how many jobs are available ask what is needed for the job

1095350 im excited by the new season of course i am
1095351 biren places a lot of emphasis on her kids childhood and education and so given her character becoming a full time mother is something that she would do
1095352 now though he is no longer the prime minister and so no longer able to carry out his threat to remove judges the coalition party that he led is still around
1095353 an attempt to indoctrinate those attending the boot camp to hold the view that the government interest as being more important than all else when we are considering our judgement
1095354 i cant say im surprised by the revelations there have been many stories in the past
1095355 it is regrettable that it has happened it is a bad reflection on our country we have to make sure it does not happen again
1095356 you should not tell judges what they can or cannot do
1095357 an investigation will not reveal anything more than what we know what we need to do is restore judicial independence and make sure such incidents do not happen
1095358 judges both present and past must be encouraged to come forward and provide information on any such instances of interference so that further action may be taken
1095359 one out of every four people at willow creek was stalled in their spiritual growth or dissatisfied with the church and many of them were considering leaving
1095360 has revolutionized the way i look at the role of the local church
1095361 it has caused me to see clearly that the church and its myriad of programs have taken on too much of the responsibility for peoples spiritual growth
1095362 the quick answer because god wired us first and foremost to be in growing relationship with him not with the church
1095363 prayer journaling solitude studying scripture things that individuals can do on their own to grow in their relationship with christ
1095364 the research strongly suggests that the church declines in influence as people grow spiritually
1095365 need to learn to feed themselves through personal spiritual practices that allow them to deepen their relationship with christ we want to transition the role of the church from spiritual parent to spiritual coach
1095366 i believe in christ but i havent grown much lately
1095367 my faith is central to my life and im trying to grow but my church is letting me down
1095368 60 percent would like to see more in depth bible teaching
1095369 part of a conversation not a dead book from which i extract truth
1095370 has experience understanding and perspective there is no one who is totally devoid of truth
1095371 the church is the people of god who gather together with a sense of mission acts 14 27 we cant go to church because we are the church
1095372 the reformers in their effort to raise the authority of the bible and ensure sound doctrine defined the marks of a true church a place where the gospel is rightly preached the sacraments are rightly administered and church discipline is exercised however over time these marks narrowed the definition of the church itself as a place where instead of a people who are reality the word church became defined as a place where certain things happen such as preaching and communion
1095373 we famously saw this with the patriot act but washington learned nothing from that
1095374 the question is do we allow some lending institutions to collapse or do we allow the dollar to collapse

1095389 do you think in obama era will there be freedom of speech will you have a voice if it only differs from the radical left
1095390 all voices including medias and lights are being shut off
1095391 thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind
1095392 and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
1095393 on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets
1095394 if thou lovest me thou shalt serve me and keep all my commandments
1095395 is probably as old as the human family in ancient times prophet leaders repeatedly gave to church members the commandment to observe the law of fasting and praying
1095396 if you want to get the spirit of your office and calling as a new president of a quorum a new high councilor a new bishop or i might say a relief society president try fasting for a period i dont mean just missing one meal then eating twice as much the next meal i mean really fasting and praying during that period it will do more to give you the real spirit of your office and calling and permit the spirit to operate through you than anything i know
1095397 let this be an example to all saints and there will never be any lack for bread when the poor are starving let those who have fast one day and give what they otherwise would have eaten to the bishops for the poor and every one will abound for a long time and so long as the saints will all live to this principle with glad hearts and cheerful countenances they will always have an abundance
1095398 behold now it came to pass that the people of nephi were exceedingly rejoiced because the lord had again delivered them out of the hands of their enemies therefore they gave thanks unto the lord their god yea and they did fast much and pray much and they did worship god with exceedingly great joy
1095399 they had the spirit of prophecy and the spirit of revelation and when they taught they taught with power and authority of god
1095400 fellowcitizens with the saints and of the household of god
1095401 behold ye do love money and your substance and your fine apparel more than ye love the poor and the needy the sick and the afflicted
1095402 be liberal in your giving that you yourselves may grow dont give just for the benefit of the poor but give for your own welfare give enough so that you can give yourself into the kingdom of god through consecrating of your means and your time
1095403 what would happen if the principles of fast day and the fast offering were observed throughout the world the hungry would be fed the naked clothed the homeless sheltered a new measure of concern and unselfishness would grow in the hearts of people everywhere
1095404 then shalt thou call and the lord shall answer thou shalt cry and he shall say here i am the lord shall guide thee continually and satisfy thy soul in drought and thou shalt be like a watered garden and like a spring of water whose waters fail not
1095405 succor the weak lift up the hands which hang down and strengthen the feeble knees
1095406 as we live the law of the fast we not only draw nearer to god through prayer but we feed the hungry and care for the poor
1095407 mountains inspire awe in any person who has a soul they remind us of our frailty our unimportance of the briefness of our span upon this earth they touch the heavens and sail serenely at an altitude beyond even the imaginings of a mere mortal
1095408 if everybody was inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could save just as much
1095409 resto a favore di un provvedimento efficace per migliorare le condizioni dei precari e a questo proposito sono rallegrato dallassicurazione da parte dellesecutivo a valutare lipotesi di accogliere le stesse disposizioni contenute nellemendamento oggetto nei prossimi giorni di un ordine del giorno
1095410 presenter infatti un ordine del giorno che riporti unopportuna modifica allarticolo 21 del decreto legge 112 per offrire alle aziende interessate dal provvedimento e alle organizzazioni sindacali la possibilit di sottoscrivere degli accordi migliorativi e maggiormente vantaggiosi sia per i lavoratori che per le stesse imprese
1095411 questa manovra che da una parte persegue una filosofia accettabile ossia quella che concerne lo snellimento procedurale del provvedimento dallaltro si presta a una
1095412 non una manovra contro gli italiani ma anzi in favore dei ceti pi deboli del paese e un momento di difficolt economica internazionale e questa manovra la risposta giusta per affrontare i tempi di questa crisi
1095413 nel governo lispirazione veniva soffocata un poco non c tempo per lei
1095414 se in questo caso il contrasto stato assente o mascherato vi sono altri episodi dove invece il dimissionario non ha risparmiato le proprie critiche un esempio su tutti quello di
1095415 il caso marina silva non si discosta tanto dal caso gil
1095416 if we were to make political donations a problem in getting a contract with government we wouldnt have any contractors doing business with government
1095417 how are you going to leave politics aside on this
1095418 all the people involved in this are politically connected this thing is as red hot as a baked potato
1095419 because of the democratic congress delays and the need for action now president bush will sign this bill when he receives it despite our concerns with some provisions including nearly 4 billion to help lenders not the homeowners this legislation is intended to serve
1095420 this is far more than sending a bill to the presidents desk for his signature its sending a message to the american people that the congress of the united states despite an alternative reputation can actually get things done and can work together to achieve a good result
1095421 one gathers theres some kind of linkage between novaks diminished condition and his claiming not to have seen or noticed a pedestrian that he hit with his car
1095422 hopefully freeman has another two decades of films and happy life ahead of him
1095423 its safe to say that freeman could be dead right now and wed be better off for it
1095424 i feel like im still a teenager because im perpetually in high school
1095425 it is incumbent on the united states to find areas of cooperation and strategic agreement with russia and china even when there are significant differences
1095426 many countries for example have questions about the pace and scope of chinas military expansion
1095427 for eight months of the year we know of no other life save that of the salt our feet are callused our hands hard as stone our backs are gone i am so wrinkled will anyone look at me and say that im only 35 years old we are up by 5 a m do the housework and are at the saltpans from 7 a m till noon when it is too hot for any living creature then we are back again till the sun goes down tell me is this any life i am tired i cant do this any more teach me a new skill any new skill i want to get out of this life
1095428 i have been blinded by the salt and my eyesight has gone so weak i cant thread a needle my parents did this work and so do i but i dont want our children to do the same
1095429 we draw water from saline bore wells let them into the salt beds and rake the beds for the salt crystals that form every eight days carefully making small hills of salt for the contractor to take away everybody works in the saltpans my husband my sons our hired labour and i
1095430 tankers supply drinking water but its quality is so poor everyone here suffers from kidney stones
1095431 it was difficult as older children work in the saltpans and parents were reluctant to send them to school but we persisted
1095432 the salt owners asked for proof that we produced salt for them but none of us have any identity cards and there was a lot of pressure on us to withdraw
1095433 salt companies blacklist us and refuse to buy our salt if we speak up
1095434 by sunset i shall make at least 400 trips back and forth from the saltpan paatas low mud walled reservoirs that trap the saline water to form the saltpan bed to the mound of salt at its edge
1095435 the desert is a lonely place our clothes and food are covered with the salt and dust everything spoils in this heat
1095436 i had studied till the seventh standard i never wanted to marry an agaria but my family said that i needed to work the salt has taken away my dreams
1095437 but he said that it would be for five days only and then the almighty would be kind to me and call me till today the almighty hasnt done so im still waiting
1095438 we will not bring them to the desert to work on the saltpans we have to break this circle somewhere
1095439 y ou either live long enough to see yourself become a villain or die a hero
1095440 keep in mind i never said you shouldnt test your codes interaction with the database you absolutely should i merely categorized that sort of test as a different sort of test an integration test you might still use your favorite unit testing framework to automate such a test but i suggest trying to keep it in a separate test suite the pragmatic programmer from journeyman to master have a great answer to this question with their comparison to integrated circuits which have features designed specifically to enable testability design for test
1095441 alles nur marketing hier das ist die eigentliche gesch ftsidee
1095442 sofort die weinbrand genussscheine f r 15einviertel raus daf r 160 krawatten zu fix 8einhalb maximal 12dreiviertel
1095443 mein makler jetzt sag blo du bist nicht auf dem weihnachtsmarkt
1095444 nun dieses jahr war es am sonntag so kalt die kinder wollten nicht und der hund
1095445 siehst du hier kommt der moderne anleihemarkt ins spiel warum gibst du nicht krawattenwertgutscheine aus und verk ufst sie einfach
1095446 h ndler ambitionierte privatleute personen die in ihre altersvorsorge investieren
1095447 das nennt man dann optionen kein mensch will ja in wirklichkeit deine krawatte schau hier ich habe hier optionsscheine zu 5 80 f r 5 krawatten gekauft die werden aber momentan mit 6einhalb notiert weil irgend so ein politiker ge u ert hat dass krawatten zu weihnachten was wichtiges sind da schlie t der markt auf nachfrage nach krawatten
1095448 das ist gut gib einfach genussscheine heraus pralinen stehen momentan ziemlich gut
1095449 bei den pralinen l uft der bulle am neuen pralinenmarkt haben wir in den letzten wochen ganz enorme zuw chse gemacht ich k nnte dir 6 50 f r jeweils 5 geben und das ist ein guter preis
1095450 also das mit den krawatten scheint mir interessant zu sein dann kann ich ja quasi jetzt schon das geld f r die geschenke ausgeben die ich erst noch bekommen werde
1095451 gut dass du das sagst als quasi hoch risikoanleihen das muss n mlich als kursrelevanter faktor bei der weihnachtsb rsenaufsicht gemeldet werden oder wenn mit der schenkung von hochwertigen seidenkrawatten als weihnachtsgratifikation zu rechnen ist das erh ht nat rlich den wert der betreffenden tranche und k nnte als insiderhandel gewertet werden
1095452 ich bitte dich das ist new economy und das tolle ist alle haben was davon du kannst deine weihnachtssachen loswerden und ne gute mark machen und f r die profis kann der handel zu einer echten beruflichen alternative werden
1095453 und wenn man nach weihnachten die ausgegebenen geschenke doch nicht hergeben will
1095454 ist doch kein problem dann zahlt man dem inhaber den aktuellen handelswert nichtr ckgabeaufschlag in bar aus brigens sind optionsscheine als geschenke der absolute renner
1095455 na ist doch logisch wie viel krawatten kriegst du im schnitt weil die leute nicht wissen was sie dir schenken sollen
1095456 na also du gibst einfach jetzt 10 optionsscheine f r krawatten aus die du ja nach weihnachten bekommen wirst dann verschenkst du einfach die krawattenoptionsscheine direkt der optionsschein ist ja so gut wie eine krawatte und zu weihnachten bekommst du ja sowieso welche und dann haben dich deine weihnachtsgeschenke berhaupt nichts gekostet
1095457 das hei t aber auch wenn das jeder macht ja dann verschenke ich gutscheine und bekomme auch krawatten als gutscheine dann hat kein mensch irgendetwas bezahlt und trotzdem hat jeder eine krawatte gekriegt geht das denn
1095458 my son was a policeman in 2004 he was murdered in cold blood by his colleagues till date i wait for the law to punish his murderers
1095459 im sure that with the mha on my side the authorities will realise that im no longer a lone powerless widow
1095460 in our society a widowed woman whether it is because the husband died or just abandoned her faces a lot of discrimination people take advantage of widows as they have no one to defend their rights they have less confidence than others do generally we look down on a woman without a husband and do not treat a widowed woman or her children with equality and respect we call them hmeithai widow and hmeithai fa widows child quite disparagingly
1095461 i was too stunned to do anything but then i had this child to think of
1095462 we will collect money and support her college education she will do well and be an example for others
1095463 its the first to be struck off the meagre family budget in favour of food and shelter
1095464 theres no point in contributing money for education because of the poverty the money is often used up to buy essentials thats why the mha school was set up to provide free accommodation and education and to liberate children from the tensions of poverty
1095465 we have seen that the rich or those with salaried jobs can afford to go outside the state for medical care in the event of serious illnesses like cancer the poor simply remain at home and wait for death

1095512 i think history will view the games as a significant milestone in chinas remarkable transformation
1095513 it is our hope that through the games we can show the world the sincere aspiration of the chinese people to share the benefits of development and to join with the rest of the world in building a bright future

1095530 the renewed turmoil in financial markets and the weakness of economic activity means that any window that had opened for raising rates is now firmly closed again
1095531 plossers decision to vote with the majority in late june seemed to be mainly due to a matter of timing and he recently warned that rates needed to rise sooner rather than later
1095532 gradually building in a longer run inflation problem that could come to haunt us next year
1095533 by establishing a transparent and credible commitment to a specific numerical inflation objective monetary policy can provide a firm anchor for long run inflation expectations thereby directly contributing to the objective of low and stable inflation
1095534 the u s and global financial systems are going through a very challenging period of adjustment the critical imperative today is to help facilitate that adjustment and to cushion its impact on the broader economy

1095539 the reality is that we will be hit by an influenza pandemic at some point but we dont know if it will be this year or in 50 years time so governments are loathe to spend the money and the effort when they dont know

1095543 searching for initiatives to make its fleet more energy efficient
1095544 this is all about attracting staff using different modes of delivery because of the problems australia post is having attracting staff with motorbike licences
1095545 they are doing this to reduce costs minimise potential accidents on the road and also reduce fuel costs
1095546 if they could wave the magic wand and get all their delivery done without using a motorbike yes they would
1095547 we are arguing that the reason they have motorbikes is it is the most efficient mode of delivery
1095548 at the moment those rounds are having to be covered by the other posties who are doing extra work
1095549 they can only do that for so long before they chuck it in it is getting to be a real pressure point
1095550 there is no petrol involved at all petrol is yesterdays technology
1095551 however this is not a motorcycle they are power assisted bicycles the motor is there to assist pedalling not a substitute for it
1095552 fuel costs and a need for cleaner forms of delivery mean some areas could benefit from these alternative forms of transport and we are keen to explore this possibility
1095553 we are also trying alternative fuels such as propane natural gas and lpg and using the new gas injected diesel technology
1095554 in addition we have in the past 12 months undertaken a hybrid truck trial which has demonstrated benefits both in terms of reduced fuel consumption and lower emissions but unfortunately currently has a limited application to our fleet
1095555 parents expect the very best when they send their kids to be looked after
1095556 the majority of operators run professional high quality centres and they have nothing to worry about
1095557 we will continue to work with childcare centres and pre schools to address problems as they arise but if they consistently fail to fix any identified issues then we will take more serious action such as prosecution or revoking operators licences
1095558 these are the key issues thats why well be making sure that anyone who breaks those and faces prosecution when they are prosecuted they will be put on this website
1095559 what works in the us must also work over there
1095560 its not just unwanted adult cats and dogs that are being put to death its kittens and puppies as well
1095561 in addition to trialling different methods of encouraging identification and desexing they will also collect baseline data to monitor the numbers of levels of animals being euthanased
1095562 we have a housing market going into cardiac arrest this bill is like cpr to stabilize the situation
1095563 this package should be enough life support to keep the situation from getting much worse and finally allow normal market forces to correct

1095588 the whole reason we went out and acquired the licence and that we now own fallout is that we clearly intended to make more than one

1095614 we had a chance to add on and we did so that was nice to see youve got to play your way out of things sometimes
1095615 it was like so many other games hes pitched this year very well pitched he continued to pitch well and we got him some runs and picked him up
1095616 we found a way to get the big hit before they did
1095617 our pitching held on at the end maddux has pitched well enough to win those games it was nice to get him a one run lead and then be able to add on to secure that victory for him
1095618 he gave us a chance to win we just had a real real tough time against maddux hes had our number and today he did again we just couldnt do much we got shut down
1095619 im not going to assault sen mccains character im not going to compare him to pop stars
1095620 i want to put a tax cut of up to 1 000 into the pockets of 95 of working americans and if youre a family making less than 250 000 a year my plan wont raise your taxes one penny not your income taxes not your payroll taxes not your capital gains taxes not any of your taxes mccain is opposed to regular increases in the minimum wage i want to index it so that it rises with rising costs he thinks the earned income tax credit is fine as it is i want to expand it he has no plans to make childcare more affordable or help people get paid sick leave while i do
1095621 in the end under senator mccains plans if youre doing spectacularly well now youll do even better otherwise youll likely be stuck running in place or fall even further behind
1095622 we need to focus on fixing and improving our public schools not throwing our hands up and walking away from them we need to stop the tired old attacks and start getting results for our children
1095623 if people tell you that we cant afford to invest in education or health care or good jobs you just remind them that were spending 10 billion a month in iraq and if we can spend that much money in iraq we can spend some of that money right here in america in cities all across this country
1095624 i think that obama talked about it in more depth and demonstrated a real understanding about the urban league its work and agenda mccain offered his perspective on education and while he endorsed the compact he did not go into as much depth about it and its recommendations as obama did

1095872 if theres one generalization to be made about the nsas outsourced it information technology programs it is this they havent worked very well and some have been spectacular failures in 2006 the nsa was unable to analyze much of the information it was collecting as a result more than 90 percent of the information it was gathering was being discarded without being translated into a coherent and understandable format only about 5 percent was translated from its digital form into text and then routed to the right division for analysis
1095873 the key phrase in the new counterterrorism lexicon is public private partnerships in reality partnerships are a convenient cover for the perpetuation of corporate interests
1095874 the separate bookkeeping and accountability devised for blackwater dyncorp triple canopy and similar outfits was part of a careful displacement of oversight from congress to the vice president and the stewards of his policies in various departments and agencies to have much of the work parceled out to private companies who are unaccountable to army rules or military justice meant among its other advantages that the cost of the war could be concealed beyond all detection
1095875 bill clinton picked up the cudgel where the conservative ronald reagan left off and took it deep into services once considered inherently governmental including high risk military operations and intelligence functions once reserved only for government agencies by the end of clintons first term more than 100 000 pentagon jobs had been transferred to companies in the private sector among them thousands of jobs in intelligence by the end of his second term in 2001 the administration had cut 360 000 jobs from the federal payroll and the government was spending 44 percent more on contractors than it had in 1993

1095942 several american officials said the israeli exercise appeared to be an effort to develop the militarys capacity to carry out long range strikes and to demonstrate the seriousness with which israel views irans nuclear program
1095943 have openly voiced support for a pre emptive nuclear strike
1095944 a senior defense official told abc news there is an increasing likelihood that israel will carry out such an attack
1095945 public warnings by u s hawks close to cheneys office that either the israelis or the u s would attack iran between the november elections and the inaugural of a new president in january 2009

1095947 one oil speculator told me that oil would hit 200 a barrel within minutes
1095948 react fiercely and nobody can imagine what would be the reaction of iran

1095950 the first bullet fired by america at iran will be followed by iran burning down its vital interests around the globe
1095951 a military strike in my opinion would be worse than anything possible it would turn the region into a fireball
1095952 the possibility that war with the united states and israel was imminent
1095953 its always awkward to talk about hypotheticals in this case but i think that while iran cannot attack us directly militarily i think that their capacity to potentially close off the persian gulf to all exports of oil their potential to unleash a significant wave of terror both in the well in the middle east and in europe and even here in this country is very real their ability to get hezbollah to further destabilize lebanon i think is very real so i think that while their ability to retaliate against us in a conventional military way is quite limited they have the capacity to do all of the things and perhaps more that i just described
1095954 a democratic senator told me that late last year in an off the record lunch meeting secretary of defense gates met with the democratic caucus in the senate such meetings are held regularly gates warned of the consequences if the bush administration staged a preemptive strike on iran saying as the senator recalled well create generations of jihadists and our grandchildren will be battling our enemies here in america gatess comments stunned the democrats at the lunch
1095955 repeatedly made clear that he opposes an attack on iran whether by israel or his own forces and moreover favors dialogue with tehran without the normal white house nuclear preconditions
1095956 a u s attack on irans nuclear installations would create trouble that we arent equipped to handle easily not with ongoing wars in iraq and afghanistan adm mike mullen the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff drove that point home in a press conference last week at the pentagon

1096029 back in 04 the olympic teams performance in athens left a great deal to be desired
1096030 i had no idea at that moment that i would be asked if i would consider taking over the program but i did have a prerequisite full autonomy
1096031 i was aware of how things were structured in the past and i felt we needed to change the culture
1096032 with this program weve asked them to be committed to playing for their country and not just to play
1096033 these guys have done that over the last two years weve seen this program develop to where whether it be lebron james kobe bryant or jason kidd they feel like theyre part of a team part of a movement and theyre very proud to represent the united states
1096034 i think in some respects over the years weve been pretty arrogant saying its our game its not our game its the worlds game and the respect weve shown to international basketball over the last two years will pay dividends
1096035 when were with our teams we complain i wish i had chris paul in the backcourt or i wish i had dwight howard

1096041 it was more about ive been there ive done that its time for someone else to do it
1096042 i think we have a unique opportunity right now in representing our country and not just by going for the gold medal in beijing
1096043 we can set a standard for how the game should be played right now in our own country with teamwork with camaraderie with enthusiasm with an attention to detail that makes basketball such a great team game
1096044 this team is showing all of that hopefully well show it at an even higher level and that will serve as an example for the kids growing up where basketball wont be all about a sound bite or a highlight dunk

1096049 its great to be so far from staples center and still have so much support i feel like im home
1096050 russia did a good job of slowing us down a little bit but we still made our run at the end of the third quarter
1096051 if you take a look in past games the american team most points they score is fast breaks and its dunks i think for the most part we contained the ball
1096052 for the most part i think we did a pretty good job to stop them
1096053 russia is a team we could see in the gold medal game and a team thats been playing very well of late so it was good competition they made us run some sets slow us down a little bit but i think overall we played good defense
1096054 just did a great job of being aggressive so he played well

1096073 all that sudan has done is to put its case to the au and i think that the critics who think that when it suits their interests the au should ignore its interests in order to let the interests of the critics prevail is unrealistic

1096202 this is one of my all time favourite books by an author whose work i enjoy every time obviously i love this book except for the epilogue that is i find it completely incongruous with the rest of the book every time i reread this book i declare that im going to stop before the epilogue i never actually do though and always end up annoyed that i didnt stop
1096203 it is hard to believe the horror that must have been the civil war but brooks does a masterful job of telling this story in a 19th century voice complete with semi colons march compares favorably with the tone provided by ken burns quoting of letters and diaries in his marvelous documentary on the civil war

1096503 they say we are 53 trillion short of fulfilling the promises the government is making to the american people in todays dollars
1096504 meaning that if we want to keep the promises of medicare medicaid and social security which are basically the three major entitlement programs today we would have to set aside 53 trillion dollars and invest them at treasury rates in order to do it
1096505 for the last 40 years the federal government has had to tax every dollar made in america at 18 3 cents on that dollar to pay the bills of the federal government
1096506 by the time my three children who are three five and six years old are my age the federal government will have to tax 40 cents out of every dollar made in america just to pay the bills for the federal government at that time
1096507 they said that the current low rate the 10 percent bracket for low income americans would have to go up to 25 percent the middle income tax rate for middle income americans would have to go up to 66 percent and the top rate which is what small businesses pay would have to go to 88 percent
1096508 those would be the tax rates you would have to have if you wanted to tax your way out of this problem
1096509 and if you did that all experts conclude you would literally crash the american economy
1096510 the legacy of this country has always been that each generation confronts the challenges before it so that the next generation is better off
1096511 in the past we brought down the iron curtain and won the cold war we got through world war i we got through world war ii we won the war on the great depression
1096512 the problem that we have right now putting foreign policy aside and our fight with islamic radicalism is that we have an economic crisis we have a fiscal crisis and that is we will bankrupt this country and the best century in america will be the last century
1096513 unless we turn our fiscal situation around and pay off this debt and change the way these programs work to a more sustainable path the next generation will have inferior living standards
1096514 a roadmap for americas future a plan to solve americas long term fiscal and economic crisis
1096515 a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being interrogated on the island
1096516 would need to ask for our permission to bring any suspects to diego garcia they have not done so and no suspected terrorists are being held on diego garcia
1096517 winner gets to play in the bcs title game loser doesnt
1096518 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
1096519 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
1096520 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
1096521 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
1096522 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
1096523 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
1096524 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
1096525 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
1096526 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
1096527 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
1096528 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
1096529 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
1096530 xinhua citing police said two attackers were arrested it did not identify them
1096531 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
1096532 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
1096533 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
1096534 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
1096535 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
1096536 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
1096537 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
1096538 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
1096539 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
1096540 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
1096541 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
1096542 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
1096543 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1096544 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
1096545 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
1096546 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
1096547 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
1096548 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
1096549 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
1096550 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
1096551 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
1096552 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
1096553 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
1096554 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
1096555 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1096556 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
1096557 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
1096558 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
1096559 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
1096560 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
1096561 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
1096562 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
1096563 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
1096564 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
1096565 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
1096566 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
1096567 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
1096568 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
1096569 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
1096570 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
1096571 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
1096572 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
1096573 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
1096574 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
1096575 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
1096576 in a world that has as many tensions as our world today there is a moment of hope that comes from seeing all the worlds best young athletes gather peacefully together
1096577 when the record 205 nations many of whom are in conflict with one another come together on friday it will represent a greater sense of cooperation than we get from any political body including the u n the fact that the three most powerful men in the world will all be in one place watching the olympic opening ceremony is testament to how very curious the world is about china and how china deal with these olympics
1096578 the olympic opening ceremony is the most important event for the vast majority of the athletes here most wont come close to a medal and for them this is the pinnacle of their athletic careers
1096579 in addition to the off the charts spectacular opening ceremony that the organizers have planned what will become immediately apparent to an american audience is that these olympics are so eagerly anticipated here in china
1096580 in many ways the opening ceremony sets the tone for the two weeks of competion and celebration that will follow there is obviously a lot at stake for the chinese and im i thrilled to have the chance to be a part of a broadcast that will bring this story back to all the viewers at home
1096581 it is a brave decision because kp hasnt done much captaincy before
1096582 but everything he has done in his career he has easily stepped up to the mark and found a way to deal with it
1096583 i think that selfish aspect is overplayed he would probably admit in his youth he was a bit like that but i dont think he is like that so much now
1096584 the selectors had a decision to make if they wanted a captain for all three formats including twenty20 the list would have been short
1096585 im not involved in two of the formats i would have liked to have done the test job and to that degree i am disappointed i have not been given the opportunity i enjoyed it when i had a go a couple of years ago
1096586 its a big job to take on but if anyone can do well then its him
1096587 it was a bit too much for me during the last ashes series and affected my form as an all rounder but kevins a batsman and the captaincy shouldnt affect his ability
1096588 his batting his aggressive and his captaincy will be similar
1096589 he likes to work very hard and likes to think about all aspects of his game he has the backing of his team
1096590 when i originally signed him up for notts i saw his talent as batsman and bowler
1096591 im delighted for him but i think he will need all the help in the world the england players dont play county cricket and dont get experience of captaincy
1096592 kevin has to make sure he is still focused on his job as a batsman you cant have roy of the rovers as captain
1096593 you have to make the experienced paul collingwood the vice captain and you have to have former captains michael vaughan and nasser hussain giving him ideas
1096594 england need someone they can respect and who can take them forward over a period of time
1096595 there are precedents for the best player being the captain allan border did it for australia and viv richards they were both successful so why not
1096596 the most important thing about being a leader is having the respect of the players because then they follow you and play for you
1096597 he needs to surround himself with a good unit he needs to back his own instinct
1096598 its often instinct you rely on on the field and man management off the field
1096599 it was absolutely fantastic everyone seemed to enjoy themselves and we had a blast doing it the official attendance record is 423 thats more that any other unlicensed transformers convention in europe were really very pleased all the hard work organising it paid off
1096600 the biggest mistake we made was that we tried to make agreements
1096601 everybody had his own responsibility and then some people did not do what they promised
1096602 we wasted precious time by cutting rope from the bottom and bringing it up
1096603 if you cant go down you have to climb up
1096604 so in such a difficult situation you are taking more risks youre climbing more technical slopes and finally you make a little mistake and youre gone
1096605 people were running down but didnt know where to go so a lot of people were lost on the mountain on the wrong side wrong route and then you have a big problem
1096606 so actually everybody was fighting for himself and i still do not understand why everybody were leaving each other
1096607 i didnt have time to start discussion the only thing i had to do was to go down because if you go down you have more oxygen you have more chance to survive
1096608 israeli authorities halted the process however as they received information that they were being arrested by hamas and that their lives were in immediate danger
1096609 while i do not agree with every part of it i very much appreciate the bipartisan spirit in which it was constructed
1096610 i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term position
1096611 we will be disappointed if there is no response to the e3 proposals by tomorrow
1096612 we will have no choice but to ask the un to proceed with further sanctions
1096613 expressed its disappointment at the lack of a clear response from iran
1096614 if we dont get an encouraging response from the iranians we will have to show firmness resort to sanctions as in the past
1096615 we agreed that in the absence of a positive response we have no choice but to pursue further measures
1096616 we are disappointed that we have not yet received a response from iran as requested in geneva on july 19
1096617 they also emphasized that preserving this path talks needs a positive and constructive atmosphere
1096618 no enemy vessels would be able to escape it within a 300 kilometer radius from the borders of iran
1096619 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
1096620 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
1096621 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
1096622 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
1096623 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
1096624 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
1096625 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
1096626 who are open to doing something on the production side
1096627 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
1096628 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
1096629 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
1096630 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
1096631 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
1096632 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
1096633 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
1096634 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
1096635 thats how well not only protect our auto industry and our auto workers but help them thrive in a 21st century economy
1096636 we will help states like michigan build the fuel efficient cars we need and we will get 1 million 150 mile per gallon plug in hybrids on our roads within six years
1096637 at the turn of the 20th century there were literally hundreds of car companies offering a wide choice of steam vehicles and gas engines
1096638 i believe we are entering a similar era of expanding consumer choices from higher mileage cars to new electric entrants like gms volt to flex fuel cars and trucks powered by biofuels and driven by michigan innovation

1096679 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
1096680 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

1096684 these are the key issues thats why well be making sure that anyone who breaks those and faces prosecution when they are prosecuted they will be put on this website

1096688 searching for initiatives to make its fleet more energy efficient
1096689 this is all about attracting staff using different modes of delivery because of the problems australia post is having attracting staff with motorbike licences
1096690 they are doing this to reduce costs minimise potential accidents on the road and also reduce fuel costs
1096691 if they could wave the magic wand and get all their delivery done without using a motorbike yes they would
1096692 we are arguing that the reason they have motorbikes is it is the most efficient mode of delivery
1096693 at the moment those rounds are having to be covered by the other posties who are doing extra work
1096694 they can only do that for so long before they chuck it in it is getting to be a real pressure point
1096695 there is no petrol involved at all petrol is yesterdays technology
1096696 however this is not a motorcycle they are power assisted bicycles the motor is there to assist pedalling not a substitute for it
1096697 fuel costs and a need for cleaner forms of delivery mean some areas could benefit from these alternative forms of transport and we are keen to explore this possibility
1096698 we are also trying alternative fuels such as propane natural gas and lpg and using the new gas injected diesel technology
1096699 in addition we have in the past 12 months undertaken a hybrid truck trial which has demonstrated benefits both in terms of reduced fuel consumption and lower emissions but unfortunately currently has a limited application to our fleet
1096700 no this is it im going to get my own place
1096701 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
1096702 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
1096703 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
1096704 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
1096705 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
1096706 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
1096707 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
1096708 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

1096711 womens noirs have been ignored because the mass media and academic descriptions of film noir only deal with the hardboiled
1096712 by my count these published sources of womens noirs nearly equal all published works aimed at a male audience but not all mens noirs are based on hardboiled short stories or hardboiled novels
1096713 the standard view of film noir lavishes attention on the femme fatale and ignores the woman in distress
1096714 it is critical to assess the full range of film noirs that were released between 1940 and 1959 if we wish to understand the full range of political and social issues that film noir addresses take for example womens sexuality
1096715 finally until womens film noirs are properly recognized a comprehensive history and a balanced analysis of film noir will be by definition impossible

1097150 he wounds maims and cripples a soul who raises doubts about or destroys faith in the ultimate truths god will hold such an one strictly accountable and who can measure the depths to which one shall fall who fitfully shatters in another the opportunity for celestial glory

1097191 bottom line is i think that both candidates feel squeezed so the best approach is to talk about the economy
1097192 the senator so far has not been a candidate who motivates the grassroots
1097193 but these issues motivate the grassroots and will get the people in churches and people who care about these issues not only out to vote but hopefully bringing their friends along

1097208 the average dram contract price is expected to decline by more than 10 percent from the current level by the end of the third quarter
1097209 the inventory level in the channel and among pc oems has increased compared to the second quarter global economic conditions are adding more uncertainty on the demand side of the equation
1097210 the higher than anticipated increase in unit shipments in the second quarter signals that excess inventory is being shifted from the dram suppliers to the buyers
1097211 they have money to buy expensive boats from all the oil they sell illegally
1097212 was taken extremely seriously by all of those operators who have offshore facilities
1097213 if i look at the production impact from bonga that was taken over the second quarter it was only 6 000 barrels per day so thats mainly a safety concern
1097214 i have to say we have had many contacts including the most senior in nigeria this year
1097215 theres very good awareness of how serious the situation is

1097217 there will be games that will be enhanced by the wii motionplus as well as games that can only be played with it
1097218 users will need four if they have four controllers but were going to try to offer it for as little as possible we havent announced the price yet but the cost of making the wii motionplus is not that much so i think we can make it very affordable
1097219 most of the ideas for accessories that we had initially come up with are out now we might think up some more and we might make them if we do but we dont have any plans to release a whole lot more
1097220 the hardware team started work on the next thing as soon as they were done with their previous project but what they think up doesnt necessarily become a product

1097227 there are also some important human health benefits related to components of grass finished beef
1097228 while there is no difference in the cholesterol content of grass and grain finished beef and the limited amount of conjugated linoleic acid in cooked steaks is too small to do much for human health there is still an advantage in the increased omega 3 fat content in grass fed beef
1097229 the results of the study showed that most consumer evaluations of the cooked meat were not influenced by frame sizes of the cattle weight at harvest range of grazing period from 120 180 days and final fat composition of the carcass
1097230 however all of the cattle must have plenty of high quality forage to consume daily plus be harvested at 18 months of age or less none of the production practices or consumer values studied were related to the final fatty acid profiles or cholesterol content of the steaks
1097231 not surprisingly we found finishing productive healthy cattle on good pastures and stored forages for at least 120 days is far more important to consumer acceptance of the product than cattles frame size or how fat the animals are
1097232 in fact we found cattle that had the fattest final carcasses actually had lower scores from the consumer panels because of the influence of fat on beef flavor
1097233 further research will attempt to reduce the inconsistency of consumer scores for many traits of the meat by post harvest interventions such as marinades and carcass aging

1097311 lack of any evidence that the routine use of ecg screening before beginning medication for adhd treatment would prevent sudden death
1097312 a core aspect of the association between short sleep duration and overweight may be attributed to reduced rem sleep
1097313 further studies are needed to investigate possible mechanisms underpinning the association between diminished rem sleep and endocrine and metabolic changes that may contribute to obesity
1097314 thus it is possible to speculate that the association between short sleep duration and obesity may also be sleep stage dependent
1097315 our results demonstrate an important relationship between rem sleep and high bmi and obesity suggesting that the short sleep obesity association may be attributed to reduced rem sleep time and decreased activity during rem sleep
1097316 rapid eye movement sleep in relation to overweight in children and adolescents
1097317 these trends highlight a gradual but important change in the content of outpatient psychiatric care in the united states and a continued shift toward medicalization of psychiatric practice
1097318 the traditional model of psychiatric training with its emphasis on competency in delivering formal psychotherapy may become less relevant to future generations of psychiatrists who operate in managed care settings in which short term medication visits are the norm and formal psychotherapy is delegated to non medical professionals
1097319 we found that psychiatrists who strongly favor psychotherapy tend to prescribe medications for only slightly more than half of their patients
1097320 and a growing group of psychiatrists who prescribe medications for the large majority of patients appear to shun delivery of formal psychotherapy altogether
1097321 these findings do not detract from the beneficial effects of regular exercise on numerous aspects of physical health such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus
1097322 the antidepressant effects of exercise may only occur if the exercise is monitored and part of a therapeutic program
1097323 not support the hypothesis that exercise causes relief in anxious and depressive symptoms
1097324 suggesting that the association between exercise behavior and symptoms of anxiety and depression is not explained by a causal effect

1097326 estrogen treatment is a promising new area for future treatment of schizophrenia and potentially for other severe mental illnesses
1097327 given the acute nature of adjunctive estradiol as a treatment we can only speculate that the antipsychotic effects of estradiol would not be lasting
1097328 future studies could investigate a longer treatment period with estradiol as well as longer term follow up to determine whether the therapeutic effects may be lasting

1097340 the difference between me and mayor giuliani and governor romney is that i fought against the failed rumsfeld casey strategy and advocated for the policy that is succeeding im the one that did that im the only one and i said it in the summer of 2003 and i said it and i predicted that that strategy would fail because it was a terribly flawed strategy and i advocated the one that is succeeding now thats based on my military experience from service for many years on the armed services committee as well as in the military

1097364 based on current trends this growth will accelerate as the retail channel shifts to supplying a rapidly increasing assortment of 64 bit desktops and laptops
1097365 64 bit versions of windows will begin to find their way into high end gaming notebooks which increasingly are being used as high end notebook workstations as opposed to strictly gaming systems

1097370 there was confusion at the county level and each office handled the situation differently
1097371 its too bad that the wildlife federation had to resort to a lawsuit over this
1097372 agriculture and wildlife interests could have come to terms much better by sitting across the table from one another and hammering out any differences our goals are not that different we both want what is the best for the land and the animals
1097373 this would be a start in correcting some of the problems livestock producers are facing in securing crp forage in this disaster year
1097374 nycha needs new revenues to support the buildings that house thousands of residents in manhattan and around the city but selling off development space in hot neighborhoods without a plan and no real public review is not the answer as a city we need a comprehensive program for how to deal with the asset represented by unused nycha development rights a program that will support the authoritys operations and also increase the supply of affordable housing for new yorkers
1097375 open source oh i thought you guys were talking about open sores now thats a blog id read daily
1097376 open source is not about freedom nor is it about licenses its about community
1097377 the cat is already out of the bag when it comes to open source related business models and there is no way it is going back in

1097379 dishonest and underhanded fundraising tactics of the working oklahomans alliance political action committee
1097380 i am appalled by the actions of the working oklahomans alliance pac and the deceptive tactics they have used to swindle working oklahoma families out of their hard earned dollars
1097381 i demand that those pacs members and candidates who received donations from this unethical pac return this tainted money money that was taken off the backs and sometimes the broken backs of hardworking injured oklahomans
1097382 the deceitful tactics used by these workers compensation attorneys to gather these donations are reminiscent of old louisiana style corruption we dont need this kind of politics in oklahoma so were hopeful that the democrat candidates and pacs who took this dirty money will agree with us and return these contributions
1097383 the attorneys involved in this secretive scheme have proven they will stop at nothing to funnel money to candidates who will block workers compensation reform lawsuit reform and other pro jobs reforms that would benefit oklahoma workers
1097384 like the recent federal investigation of former senator gene stipe this deceitful behavior could go beyond mere state ethics violations this could be the tip of the iceberg
1097385 weve got to be careful not to get carried away
1097386 we both remember mcgovern in 72 and how he killed democrat ed edmondson against dewey bartlett i see the same thing happening this time around and obama probably wont do as well as mcgovern did rice probably wouldnt run too well even without the obama drag way i see it is conservative democrats just dont have much of a place to go on the top races except to our nominees that or stay home
1097387 would be outraged to know she was not given that right of first refusal
1097388 write in hillary in november i will be doing that and so will thousands of other puma members and others who just do not trust obama clinton 2012
1097389 on the one hand we have obama offering a 1000 citizen energy rebate a windfall profits tax on rich oil companies 5 million green jobs and independence from middle east oil dependency in 10 years on the other hand we have mccain offering a tire gauge peeks at britney and paris and a cameo by johns old buddy moses this is going to be a very difficult decision
1097390 lots of people like obama so you should hate him
1097391 write in hrc way to waste your vote sorry but the clintons will not get anywhere near the white house again
1097392 on the one hand we have obama offering a 1000 citizen energy rebate a windfall profits tax on rich oil companies 5 million green jobs independence from middle east oil dependency in 10 years and looking out for our injured troops on the other hand we have mccain offering tire gauges peeks at britney and paris a cameo by johns old buddy moses and fighting hard for his oil buddies this is going to be a very difficult decision
1097393 i can never bother to show up for a vote but you guys better come back to vote on these pet issues of mine
1097394 oh the constitution doesnt allow me to do that well do it anyway
1097395 in sum because we find on undisputed facts that cablevisions proposed rs dvr system would not directly infringe plaintiffs exclusive rights to reproduce and publicly perform their copyrighted works we grant summary judgment in favor of cablevision with respect to both rights
1097396 this is a tremendous victory for consumers which will allow us to make dvrs available to many more people faster and less expensively than would otherwise be possible
1097397 i do not find volume caps to be a very useful practice given an arbitrary amount of time one can transfer arbitrarily large amounts of information
1097398 rather than a volume cap i suggest the introduction of transmission rate caps which would allow users to purchase access to the internet at a given minimum data rate and be free to transfer data at at least up to that rate in any way they wish

1097418 colleagues and friends of the vaccine specialist remained convinced that ivins was innocent they contended that he had neither the motive nor the means to create the fine lethal powder that was sent by mail to news outlets and congressional offices in the late summer and fall of 2001
1097419 usamriid doesnt deal with powdered anthrax i dont think theres anyone there who would have the foggiest idea how to do it you would need to have the opportunity the capability and the motivation and he didnt possess any of those
1097420 it makes sense what the social worker said he considered himself like a god

1097422 it was now december 2001 yet dolan and altimaris hartford courant story was the first i had heard of the quantico letter supervisory special agent james r fitzgerald had not heard of it either in fact there were quite a few critical documents that fitzgerald had not yet seen what i wondered has the anthrax task force been doing hoping that the quantico letter might lead if not to the killer at least to a suspect i offered to examine the document my photocopy arrived by fedex not from the task force but from fbi headquarters in washington searching through documents by some 40 usamriid employees i found writings by a female officer that looked like a perfect match i wrote a detailed report on the evidence but the anthrax task force declined to follow through the quantico letter had already been declared a hoax and zero filed as part of the 9 11 investigation
1097423 the trail that leads us to the perpetrators of the anthrax letter terrorist attacks ends at ft detrick
1097424 writings by a female officer that looked like a perfect match
1097425 in short and simple terms we would be plunged into a depression that would make the great depression of the 1930s in which i spent my childhood look like boom times
1097426 industries would fail banks would collapse government revenues would dry up universities would have to close health care even as limited as it now is for roughly 75 million americans would virtually cease in short something like what the south suffered at the end of the civil war would plague the country
1097427 even at todays price as you know 14 airlines have gone out of business while others are hovering on the brink of bankruptcy and most have curtailed service and laid off personnel
1097428 at double or triple todays price none could fly unless nationalized a whole range of other industries would be quickly drawn into the quicksand ironically war would push america into a form of socialist economy
1097429 so the lights are on late in washingtons federal reserve sec and treasury department trying to figure out how socialism your tax dollars and credits can once again bail out these big time gamblers with our money reckless self enriching capitalists get on your knees and thank the rescuing washington socialists for without them you would surely be in chains

1097487 u s economy grows at solid pace in 2 nd quarter
1097488 much of the improvement came from the one time bump from economic stimulus payments raising prospects of weaker performance in months ahead
1097489 looking at it from the government point of view theres a strong political motivation to understate the cpi by understating it keeps cola adjustments down on entitlements which are at this point the largest part of the governments budget and by understating cpi the government can minimize the inflationary impact on things such as rents which are indexed to cpi or wages pensions and a whole list of ancillary costs to artificially keep inflation rates down bottom line the published cpi understates the real inflation rate
1097490 while sometimes devastating these global relative price pressures are not the same thing as inflation
1097491 the fed remains skeptical that high commodity prices will ripple through the economy leading to broad price hikes and big wage increases
1097492 as consumers spend more money for higher priced petroleum and agricultural goods they eventually have less money to spend on other goods and services other relative prices must then fall
1097493 fingered exploding inflation as the biggest risk to the economy
1097494 products of public policies which deeply affect markets supply and demand consumers producers and speculators
1097495 declining capitalist investment in the productive economy the vast increase of capital flowing in the paper economy the huge increases in profits and the grotesque salaries bonuses and payoffs to senior executives totally unrelated to performance
1097496 in other words in the contemporary economy inflation benefits the wealthy because they pay their workers in deflated currency while they can take advantage of inflation to further jack up prices and then income thus the upper classes have fortified their economic positions to take account of inflation through their power over prices income and other compensations in a way that wage workers and people on fixed income and other vulnerable sectors cannot bankers protect their loans via adjustable interest rates monopoly resource owners jack up prices to retain profits wholesalers mark up prices to compensate for higher commodity prices large scale retailers squeeze final consumers the great majority at the bottom of the production and distribution chain
1097497 in asia particularly pakistan india indonesia south korea philippines nepal mongolia and china hundreds of millions of workers peasants artisans and low paid self employed workers as well as housewives and pensioners have engaged in sustained mass protests as they experience a decline in the quality and quantity of food purchases as prices skyrocket in africa hunger stalks the land and major food riots have occurred from egypt through sub saharan africa to south africa in the caribbean central and south america food riots have led to the overthrow of regimes mass protests road blockages from argentina bolivia through colombia venezuela and haiti

1097499 when i was serving a sentence on robben island during the struggle to end apartheid in south africa i never suspected that the end of white minority rule in my home country would be the beginning of yet another struggle for justice this time against the world bank and the international monetary fund
1097500 as architects of the global economy the world bank and the imf have enormous power and shape the conditions of peoples lives around the world
1097501 i live now in the united states where people so far are relatively unscathed by the reordering of the global economy for the benefit of the very rich
1097502 the imf and world bank with the structural adjustment programs saps they impose on indebted countries and their pro corporate development projects are the leading edge of oppressive globalization the policies they have imposed in africa latin america and asia have condemned people to stagnation poverty and death for twenty years and those policies are now being adopted in the countries of europe and north america too
1097503 although some of them may have tricked themselves into believing that the neo liberal economic model they defend is immutable like a law of nature most of them probably know that they are perpetrating a fraud of global proportions michael camdessus who retired after thirteen years as managing director of the imf told a group of u s religious leaders that he was willing to sacrifice a generation in order to realize the so called benefits of the macroeconomic model
1097504 given the reluctance of india and other developing nations to sacrifice food security measures in the wake of the recent global spike in food prices
1097505 the tariff cuts demanded of developing countries would have caused massive job loss and countries would have lost the ability to protect farmers from dumping further impoverishing millions on the verge of survival
1097506 we see many of the essential ingredients for a classic asset bubble said edward morse chief energy economist at lehman brothers morse estimated that 90 billion has flowed into the biggest commodity indices in just more than two years and more money has flowed into other exchanges pushing up prices
1097507 the cftcs economists are saying that supply and demand seem to be driving this but we have clients in the business that have experienced these markets for many many years and what im hearing from them is that they dont see any change in the fundamentals of supply and demand
1097508 is it a matter of institutional investors seeking shelter from the subprime crisis and the credit crunch
1097509 i dont know but i do know that speculators as a class do not agree on anything and yet there is almost unanimity of opinion these days and the money to make the opinions matter the fact that prices have been relentlessly trending up suggests a new type of market participant with a mentality that is traditionally more in line with investing in securities than trading in commodities if enough of these wealthy people or funds or other entities with a lot of capital decide to flip out of securities for a little while and go into commodities and theyre all looking for something that is going up and you get enough billions of dollars thinking that way then their wish comes true
1097510 the situation now is that the cftc is sitting there looking at one screen one piece of the picture which is whatever is happening on the exchanges meanwhile an increasing volume in dollars is taking place in the form of over the counter activity where no one can see it there is still a blind spot with respect to the true over the counter activity that is going on which represents billions and billions of dollars
1097511 in 2000 congress decided that there were certain kinds of high end investors that were big enough and smart enough that they shouldnt be constrained to do all their business on the exchanges

1097529 under the law people who give money to beggars will be jailed up to three months or have to pay a maximum fine of 1 5 million rupiah about r1800
1097530 this is an important decision to clear beggars from the streets
1097531 some 60 per cent of the parents interviewed admitted that they send their children to streets to beg and bring back to them what they got
1097532 findings of the studies will help the government develop a sustainable programme of solving the problem
1097533 these children were the future of the country and we cannot afford to neglect them
1097534 this is the first important document of my life i heard that it is extremely valuable and it will help me in future
1097535 it will protect me in many difficult situations such as child marriage or trafficking
1097536 those who have conscious parents get their birth certificate easily but these less fortunate street children are being left out as they do not have anyone to take care of it our aim is to include the hard to reach children in the system
1097537 without birth certificate it becomes extremely difficult to address child rights issues street children and child labourers are especially vulnerable
1097538 for children birth certificate is a protection tool in case of child trafficking child marriage and commercial sexual exploitation as it works as a proof of age
1097539 it gives them nationality and an identity most importantly it is the first bond between a child and the state with its help children can demand their rights to the state
1097540 most of the street children without parents or lost children who ended up on the streets do not know anything about their age or the place they were born the runaway kids usually refrain from giving the right information
1097541 many street children who have parents are also ignorant about their birth year or date even their parents do not know anything it becomes quite hard for us to gather information when the situation is like this
1097542 it could be a flood cyclone election or even a football match this is how we search for a possible age or birth month
1097543 vagrant is the boy or girl under 18 years who is vulnerable to delinquency homeless or unable to show the way to his her resident caretaker or unable to give sufficient information about himself herself
1097544 at current point of time it is extremely difficult to communicate to the children that centres have to be closed in next three months time
1097545 a positive change has been noticed in many of them showing improvement in decision making such as change in profession quitting drugs developing healthy relations with family and friends and taking care of their health
1097546 each of these centres cater around 3 000 children bringing the annual cost of saving a young life to a mere rs 600
1097547 children be they the street kids or abandoned souls or those pushed before harsh realities of life due to poverty are our collective responsibility
1097548 i could hardly believe what i was seeing or the irony of the situation
1097549 i work for a childrens rights organisation in the uk called street action and have been to durban on previous visits to liaise with local ngos that work with street children i hardly thought id be confronted by blatant human rights violations while on holiday here though
1097550 i raced outside and across to the hillock opposite the museum and saw three metro police officials lashing out at the children with sjamboks
1097551 my wife was documenting the events with her camera cellphone from the flat and filmed the burning of the childrens clothes and other belongings by the police officials
1097552 since we arrived in kwazulu natal i have chatted to those particular street kids on a number of occasions so i tried to intervene and request that the police extinguish the fire the three police officials were extremely menacing and threatened me with imprisonment
1097553 these kids are the main cause of crime and drugs in this area one of them bellowed
1097554 thats absolutely untrue this particular group of children takes enormous pride in keeping their persons and clothing neat and clean and none of them sniffs glue they have seen what it does to their fellow street children
1097555 apart from the aggression shown by the police officials the fact that they arrived with both a police van and a large police transport vehicle makes it plain that if i hadnt interceded the children would have been forcibly removed from the area and dumped somewhere outside durban as they say has happened many times in the past
1097556 it feels like these round ups are being sanctioned from on high we will definitely be putting the images we captured on our website
1097557 the durban metro police need to realise that they are violating childrens constitutional rights these are serious actions that will inevitably be exposed in the international media
1097558 we are scared but we dont know where else to go
1097559 they said they are coming back and we dont want to be put in the truck sometimes they take us very far from durban and leave us there
1097560 i must stress that we do respect childrens human rights
1097561 if these events happened then those responsible will be called to account and can be punished they are not above the law and due processes will be followed
1097562 if this incident took place as it has been described action will be taken against those involved i will need a full report from the metro police until i have had a chance to examine it it would be inappropriate to comment further
1097563 this is the second fairly serious incidence of police brutality towards children that has been reported to childline in 2008
1097564 the first in the north west required the intervention of the child law centre in pretoria

1097574 this administration has heard what it has wished to hear pressured the intelligence community to verify preconceptions undermined or sidetracked opposing voices and both instituted and been victim of procedures that guaranteed that the slightest terrorist threat reporting would receive disproportionate weight thereby comforting the administrations preconceptions and policy inclination a successful usa foreign policy begins with regaining the confidence of our allies not just the governments of our allies but the people in those countries
1097575 obamas obvious shift on the surge operations in iraq underlined by deleting criticisms of it from his website last week is strengthening his call for redeployment from iraq to afghanistan his current strategy could be summed up as de escalate the war in iraq escalate it in afghanistan and talk to iran on iran his offer of talks was coupled with an alarming bush style threat ill do everything in my power to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon it is worth noting that the term withdrawal let alone a full unconditional withdrawal that will satisfy most of the iraqi people has never been part of obamas vocabulary

1097582 community members cant change district leadership but they do have a say in electing the representatives who can the portland public schools board of education
1097583 so heres my challenge first we need to make every effort to see that the board appoints either nancy smith or steve buel to the board this summer then we need to find and recruit at least two good candidates from the madison cluster and the marshall franklin clusters respectively

1097587 the nsas vast data mining activities began shortly after bush was sworn in as president and the document declassified nsa document contradicts his assertion that the 9 11 attacks prompted him to take the unprecedented step of signing a secret executive order authorizing the nsa to monitor a select number of american citizens thought to have ties to terrorist groups
1097588 on orders from defense department officials and president bush the agency kept a running list of the names of americans in its system and made it readily available to a number of senior officials in the bush administration these sources said which in essence meant the nsa was conducting a covert domestic surveillance operation in violation of the law
1097589 the president personally and directly authorized new operations like the nsas domestic surveillance program

1097597 maps the story of esau munsey who leaves a haunted past in the city to teach fourth grade in a provincial elementary school but his intentions to provoke change in an outdated education system distract him from the students he really wants to inspire when esaus history repeats itself and the small town of manchego is struck by tragedy esau must finally put to rest the ghosts of his past and make peace with himself and his choices
1097598 obama has made speeches and written articles demonstrating his full embrace of the
1097599 without explaining what safeguards he proposes to protect teachers from arbitrary dismissal
1097600 there is no easy fix but the point is that if we commit to making sure everyone has decent care there are ways to do it
1097601 neither nader or kafoury have a single word worth reading or listening to
1097602 in a recent cnn poll 5 4 5 6 07 64 percent of respondents supported the idea that government should provide a national health insurance program for all americans even if this would require higher taxes and a recent cbs new york times poll 2 23 27 07 found 64 percent support for the idea that the federal government should guarantee health insurance for all and 60 percent supported paying higher taxes to provide such coverage additionally 50 percent believed fundamental changes to the healthcare system were necessary and another 40 percent thought the country needed to completely rebuild the system
1097603 reducing its full time permanent custodial workforce by 40 positions
1097604 if those part time workers get sick and need a doctor well tough luck the district has a budget to meet and student achievement test scores to worry about
1097605 this summer we are expanding on that past practice and offering more students short term part time work this could tie nicely into our career pathways work experience
1097606 so what the democrats are doing here with the white house is theyre trying to conceal a crime that is hiding in plain view that everyone can see it and so the argument for it is quite simple nobody wants to have a confrontation over the fact that the president committed a felony not once but at least 30 times thats a very inconvenient fact right now in washington
1097607 i got to tell you i am completely astonished by senator obamas position and obviously disappointed you know all of these senators need to respect us enough not to call it a compromise its a cave in
1097608 and in this case the fourth amendment is going to be eviscerated tomorrow and 100 people are going to watch it happen because its just not their problem
1097609 but you talk about expanding the presidents power its coming out of the marrow of the fourth amendment its coming out of the bone and its going to hurt and its being done for political convenience theres not an ounce of principle not an ounce of public interest in this legislation
1097610 support a filibuster of any bill that includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies
1097611 the warrantless wiretapping began several months before the terrorists attacks on 9 11 so testified qwest ceo joseph nacchio
1097612 underlying that strategy is a crippling fear that playing too rough with the criminals in power will undermine chances of electoral success in november 2008
1097613 i have spent all my life under a communist regime and i will tell you that a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed but a society with no other scale but the legal one is not quite worthy of man either
1097614 if humanism were right in declaring that man is born to be happy he would not be born to die since his body is doomed to die his task on earth evidently must be of a more spiritual nature

1097622 its just a couple of awacs they dont have to go to a particular airport
1097623 yes we have gotten business from them as well as other area hotels
1097624 the point of contention is that instead of obama solely lecturing african americans on parental duty particularly fathers he should have also given equal attention to the large and many believe prejudicial incarceration rate for blacks their lack of economic opportunity and other public policy issues that limit choices for black males
1097625 but then hes exactly what jeremiah wright says he is he will do whatevers necessary to win
1097626 the results of those laws and the results of particularly enforcing them with such brutality through this forced labor system the result of that was that african americans thousands and thousands of them worked for years and years of their lives
1097627 and so yes this whole regime of the black codes the way that they were enforced the physical intimidation and racial violence that went on all of these were facets of the same coin that made it incredibly less likely that african americans would emerge out of poverty in the way that millions of white americans did at the same time
1097628 as the associated press claimed in a typical description obamas shifts are designed to appeal to the center of the electorate however empirical data prove the center of the electorate is exactly the opposite polls by quinnipiac university and the mellman group found majorities support warrant requirements for wiretaps and oppose immunity for companies that released private consumer information without such warrants surveys by fortune magazine cnn and the wall street journal report that most americans oppose nafta style trade policies for years major polls have consistently shown americans want a firm timetable for withdrawal from iraq as just one of many examples five separate usa today surveys since 2007 have shown majorities want the president to set a timetable for removing troops from iraq and to stick to that timetable regardless of what is going on in iraq so the undebatable evidence tells us precisely where the center of public opinion is yet when a presidential candidate moves away from the center we are told he is moving toward it what gives
1097629 obama is running as a symbol of a new politics a politics somehow less disgusting and full of shit than the old politics but if it were to get out that hes not that that all he is is the same old deal dressed up in black skin and a natty suit then he quickly
1097630 no im not taking some ultra left position that elections are totally insignificant and that we should refuse to vote to preserve our moral purity yes there are candidates who are somewhat better than others and at certain times of national crisis the thirties for instance or right now where even a slight difference between the two parties may be a matter of life and death im talking about a sense of proportion that gets lost in the election madness would i support one candidate against another yes for two minutes the amount of time it takes to pull the lever down in the voting booth but before and after those two minutes our time our energy should be spent in educating agitating organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace in the neighborhood in the schools our objective should be to build painstakingly patiently but energetically a movement that when it reaches a certain critical mass would shake whoever is in the white house in congress into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice
1097631 democrats say sky is blue republicans say its yellow experts issue a report that this reporter didnt have time to read

1097662 commercial reinforcement of stereotypical perceptions of african countries as being of third world status
1097663 the similarity of the main character to that of idi amin is not humorous but highly offensive and children should not view the commercial as being light hearted comedy
1097664 the whole setting of the commercial is harmless parody intended to amuse and the reasonable viewer would see it as such the main actor is not identified in any way and it is therefore not reasonable to conclude that he represents idi amin
1097665 we kicked off camp in a very powerful way with coach showing up for the meeting
1097666 he challenged the team with some very moving reminders and the players responded with some very encouraging words for him it was a great way to start camp

1097675 if we had received the money as some people are saying you could tell from the level of excitement in our camp the truth is pirates have not yet paid us for the players we sold the players to pirates we wrote letters of release to pirates but the truth is they have not paid us for the players
1097676 we tried to organise a meeting for mafoko and mogorosi with the south african high commission so that they can explain their problems to him but they refused to come to the meeting

1097680 i scored 14 goals last season and i was sure that i had won the prize only for the nfl to say that i only scored 13 goals which is an injustice
1097681 the goal he is referring to was scored in the match between enyimba and heartland and that game was not concluded because of crowd trouble
1097682 the match was eventually awarded to enyimba so since the game was not concluded the goal did not stand
1097683 he is the one who initiated this which shows his creativity and his innovative thinking and i can tell you botswana football has a good leader who is capable of taking it to another level already we have seen how football is growing here and i am sure that is because you have such a visionary president
1097684 in european history there were several alliances and in south africa we have cosatu and anc in one alliance specifically to act against something but this one is of a different type bfa and safa are joining hands to push football in the two countries to greater levels

1097696 rollers approached me and i never expected them to tell me what i had to take but rather how much i needed if i had gone to them looking for a job then it would make sense that they should be the ones dictating how much they are willing to pay in this case it must be me putting a figure and then we negotiate it
1097697 it was clear he had long made up his mind about returning there comets i was not surprised that he did not agree with both chiefs and rollers because he appeared so interested in going back to jwaneng apparently comets have promised to give him a job and maybe that is why he decided to turn us down he is not telling the truth that we took too long to come up with a new contract because we started talking in april before the league ended
1097698 as times and technology change so must pure play ive witnessed the evolution from vhs to dvd the advent of the internet hd dvd vs blu ray and the upswing of broadcasting and pay per view my adoption of d2r is the correct choice to stay in line with our changing business needs by going direct to retail we can now center our attention on the many retailers and chains going direct to the source offering one of the largest libraries of studios and genres to choose from ppm offers a highly trained and experienced staff that is growing by the day we are ready and excited to see this new method take off

1097950 exxonmobil is determining which of its facilities may potentially be in the path of the storm preparing those structures for heavy wind and rain and identifying personnel for possible evacuation to shore

1097960 this is a novel and unprecedented response to what everyone recognizes as a tragic situation
1097961 the cfaa is aimed at penalizing computer trespassers but under the governments theory the millions of people who disregard or dont read the terms of service on every website they visit could face computer crime charges thats a big blank check to give federal prosecutors
1097962 websites terms of service are notoriously frivolous and overreaching often hard to find and routinely written in legalese bound to confuse a non lawyer many courts have found them unenforceable in civil cases they certainly should not be the basis for a criminal prosecution
1097963 we are concerned about what will happen to the dead sea when this amount of marine water is pumped into it
1097964 even with the conduit whether it goes ahead or not the river jordan needs to be rehabilitated
1097965 we object to the world bank identifying together with the governments a group of experts who have been picked by the water authorities

1097971 a lot of the tactics they used were designed to isolate him from his support the fbi just continued to push his buttons
1097972 and you could leave usamriid with nothing more than a couple of vials bear in mind they werent exactly doing body searches of scientists back then
1097973 the potential for something to happen is much greater now than it was in 2001 simply because of developments of technology and education
1097974 we may be putting dangerous pathogens in the hands of people who would deliberately cause harm we may also be putting them in the hands of people who may inadvertently or unintentionally take steps to put large numbers of people at risk
1097975 if smallpox returned today we could contain it and minimize the danger very quickly i could not have said that in 2001
1097976 was a very important event in the world of bioterrorism preparedness
1097977 it did finally wake people up to what bioterrorism could do in this country and in the world
1097978 a coratee is an animal that is similar to a manatee its primary diet is sea cabbage
1097979 it was hunted and killed by tuna companies and sold to you because they are easier to fish they are slow and stupid animals that are loving and soft and on the brink of extinction meaning they are in desperate need of saving
1097980 we picked save the coratee because of two real reasons one i try to live my life and everything i do with a healthy sense of the ridiculous two the mac community is a creative and innovative community hand them a fake animal with no description rather than its kinda like a manatee and people love it it builds community and creates a family feeling that is fun
1097981 when brokenstones went down we started talking with people about getting a site up but vortex beat us to it
1097982 we started talking and we were kinda moving slow brain storming etc then stuff started to go down hill at vortex so we kicked it into gear
1097983 i never want the site to be big or to loose personality
1097984 we included a lot of how would i put this win in the site or love

1097987 theyre saying they can rifle through all the information in a travelers laptop without having a smidgen of evidence that the traveler is breaking the law
1097988 dont establish any criteria for whose computer can be searched
1097989 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
1097990 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
1097991 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
1097992 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed
1097993 a longtime constitutional militia man and internet advocate for second amendment rights
1097994 just weed out a few bad apples and well be good to go
1097995 the situation has become critical and threatens the safety and security of the nation and its residents
1097996 we are deeply disturbed by this imminent loss of communications service to vital public safety agencies
1097997 in just a few days the navajo nation will lose its entire communications network including its public safety network as a byproduct of usacs mishandling of this matter
1097998 sadly mothers are also no longer able to reach out and communicate with their children at war in iraq
1097999 an internal navajo nation audit conducted during the summer of 2007 found problems with the contract between navajo nation and onsat and the bidding process that led to it
1098000 thats one thing that i have heard many people say that they work better in a group kind of situation
1098001 youll find that many of the government workers will go to lunch together
1098002 and if the fcc turns around now and gives the companies the get out of court free card it means the fcc is going to be condoning what was past illegal behavior and letting the companies off the hook for illegal behavior
1098003 a national regulatory framework protects customers from a confusing patchwork of state regulations
1098004 i was hoping to forge a bipartisan solution that would offer consumers more diversity in programming better price protection greater choices among innovative devices and real competition with digital radio
1098005 instead it appears theyre going to get a monopoly with window dressing
1098006 by golly your job is to hold their feet to the fire what have they been doing
1098007 instead the question being asked is what will a majority of the fcc vote for
1098008 and the fcc seems to be willing to approve a merger to monopoly once again demonstrating that the lobbying dollar goes a long way in washington
1098009 my concern was that there was not significant enough of a fine
1098010 when you start doing negotiations that go to a high level of detail usually they get worked out
1098011 transactions are not rejected because they couldnt figure out whether the ball should be on the 46 yard line rather than the 48 yard line
1098012 weve got to find a way to come up with legislation in richmond to prevent this kind of stuff from happening
1098013 our objective is to make these upgrades as unobtrusive as possible for the community and for the residents who are living there
1098014 and where were not doing that we work hard to make that right
1098015 it has to be an intentional ongoing deliberate practice when it happens the company has always been responsive
1098016 until we have a pattern of complaints that shows this has become a practice and not just a spot occurrence then we cant determine whether or not there has been willful violation
1098017 about 100 million first time voters will enter the election landscape next year that is a staggering number of young people and the indian youth is impatient for change
1098018 we want to project the image of advani around the idea of change the same way that obamas message resonated with peoples hunger for change
1098019 like the obama brand we need to create a buzz around advani ji
1098020 it is no longer sufficient for the u s government to discover cyber intrusions in its networks clean up the damage and take legal or political steps to deter further intrusions
1098021 we must take proactive measures to detect and prevent intrusions from whatever source as they happen and before they can do significant damage
1098022 a real and growing threat that the federal government has been slow in addressing
1098023 does not intend to write the administration a blank check
1098024 it will be imperative that the government also take into account the interests and concerns of private citizens the u s information technology industry and other elements of the private sector
1098025 as president ill make cybersecurity the top priority that it should be in the 21st century
1098026 from the networks that power the federal government to the networks that you use in your personal lives
1098027 to protect our energy supply air and rail transport banking and financial services we need to invest far more in the federal task of cyber security
1098028 we spent many tens of billions of dollars during the apollo era to purchase a commanding lead in space over all nations on earth
1098029 weve been living off the fruit of that purchase for 40 years and have not chosen to invest at a level that would preserve that commanding lead
1098030 hes been incredibly open to our ideas which has been a huge surprise coming from a key appointee from the bush white house
1098031 it suggested to me that this was going to give us far greater insight into the relationships between individuals fighting against u s forces in the theater and potential u s cells or support networks here in the united states
1098032 can raise serious privacy concerns if not singly then jointly and severally
1098033 stopping people coming into this country identifying ied makers in a way never done before thats the beauty of this whole data sharing effort were pushing our borders back
1098034 part of this may be that organizations are finding out about more breaches because theyre really starting to look for them
1098035 the other part is that companies are coming forward because they want to control the flow and spin of the disclosure

1098046 the fccs decision was pro consumer and designed to open up markets controlled by incumbent cable carriers
1098047 this means consumers will not only get more choices among providers and additional competition but also lower bills
1098048 there is nothing unexpected in the review of this arrangement as structured by the parties and department of justice officials
1098049 it involves approval at higher levels within the antitrust division
1098050 it is a significant step beyond a request for voluntary information
1098051 in many many ways the damage has already been done
1098052 it certainly would have been a lot easier if the u s government had taken this seriously back in 2004 back then these guys were looked upon as miscreants and cretins like they were just internet terrorists and not for real
1098053 it is just plain embarrassing that al qaeda is better at communicating its message on the internet than america

1098108 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1098109 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1098110 we have all heard many media reports coming out of postville which relate to the agriprocessors plant
1098111 we wanted to see first hand the status of the facilitys equipment and machinery examine the working conditions at the plant and observe how the employees are being treated
1098112 what impressed me the most was the innovations in kosher slaughter salting and the freedom of the kosher supervisory agencies to operate without managements intrusion
1098113 the jewish community is extremely important to this town and we dont want to see them leave
1098114 he had never seen a shred of evidence of any such abuses
1098115 we have had nothing but the best experience with the rubashkin family
1098116 some workers we hired while others either had issues with immigration or were inappropriate for the jobs being advertised
1098117 safety is our number one priority even ahead of production
1098118 part of the problem here appears to be a lack of communication
1098119 it became very evident that there needs to be a dialogue between the church and agriprocessors so that the two sides can have an open and honest conversation about the issues at hand
1098120 we are hoping that we can create a bridge of understanding between the church representatives and the plants management
1098121 together they can address the issues affecting the workers and actively seek solutions
1098122 the current situation at the agriprocessors plant is diametrically opposed to the rumors and innuendos that we had heard before we got here
1098123 we saw the reality not stories told over from others
1098124 that reality was far different than the one that has portrayed in the press
1098125 there were no limitations placed on us as we inspected the facility and no boundaries imposed during our visit everything and everyone was fair game
1098126 we discovered workers being treated equitably and receiving fair wages and benefits we saw a state of the art plant a tremendous emphasis on safety and excellent standards of kashruth while we have no personal knowledge of what may or may not have happened in the past the agriprocessors plant that we saw today is far different than what has been reported
1098127 to set the record straight with the help of the two dozen witnesses who joined him on the july 31st trip to postville iowa
1098128 what we observed in postville was a cadillac with top of the line machinery and a heavy emphasis on safety security and health
1098129 based on what we saw this is a modern plant that is servicing an important need and working diligently to adhere to the highest workplace standards possible what we saw and heard is how the rubashkins and agriprocessors are going well above and beyond the call of duty and the requirements of the law
1098130 espn should suspend reilly for two weeks because apparently he cant come up with a funny column idea given just one week or if thats not possible please allow me to take charles barkleys place in the above photo while someone does read all 158 verses of that greek poem i think reilly might have a greater appreciation for the ukranian anthem after such an experience

1098133 its a curse and a blessing at the same time
1098134 the internet has revolutionized my life but there are basic things that are still completely inaccessible to people like me
1098135 now were full blown into this digital era and we in general need to upgrade the laws that ensure that there is accessibility for all the people who use these new technologies
1098136 when it comes to child pornography there is no excuse this office will tolerate
1098137 we look forward to learning more about the agreement and how it will be implemented
1098138 i have been skeptical that lawsuits are a good way of ensuring protection for all consumers
1098139 while im respectful of state regulators i have been skeptical that lawsuits are a good way of ensuring protection for all consumers
1098140 the most effective way to protect a consumer is to become more involved with the principles and direction on what is reasonable and not reasonable
1098141 faced with the prospect of multiple state policies on this issue verizon believes that appropriate federal action to establish a national policy is preferable
1098142 here we are at 11th hour of the sprint case and at the dawn of the verizon trial and the fcc is being asked to step in and wipe out the rights of consumers
1098143 the jury recognized that sprint makes a significant investment in its customers through reduced handset prices and discounted monthly rates
1098144 ok folks black bloggers to the back of the bus
1098145 jim crow raises his ugly head at the democratic convention
1098146 national politics to niche issues of interest to specific communities
1098147 there is nothing democratic about an all white democratic national convention floor blogging corps
1098148 this is all very puzzling to me and to a lot of black bloggers
1098149 the democratic national committee says it wants to be inclusive it wants to have a big tent and then this what were they thinking
1098150 now most sites related to womens and human rights issues have been blocked in one day
1098151 the limits of the filtering are pornography and anti revolutionary sites this is illegal censorship
1098152 newspaper censorship social oppression and filtering are not logical unless you look at them as sub parts of overall oppression
1098153 it makes one really depressed to see his or her site being filtered but it also shows that the authorities are afraid
1098154 the goal here was to help other recipients of nsls to understand that you can push back
1098155 that calls into question how much the fbi needed the information in the first place and finally whether the fbi needs this kind of sweeping and unchecked surveillance power
1098156 remain indispensable tools for national security investigations and permit the fbi to gather the basic building blocks for our counterterrorism and counterintelligence investigations
1098157 this weekends uproar over hillary rodham clinton invoking the assassination of robert kennedy as rationale for continuing her presidential campaign is an especially vivid example of modern journalism as hyperkinetic child overstimulated by speed and hunger for a head turning angle that will draw an audience

1098164 cisco opportunity high start point planning high standard construction technical training security and operation maintenance

1098166 this is a business that could only have grown up in washington
1098167 its illegal for a monopoly to keep its customers from doing business with its competitors and thats what the issue here is
1098168 the evidence that this industry is fiercely competitive and working is compelling
1098169 this was sitting on the backburner i think he looked at it and it would have been very hard not to open an investigation
1098170 amd has accumulated very credible evidence that but for intels practices we would have seen more price competition and greater innovation
1098171 they harm consumers by denying them products that are more efficient and less costly
1098172 customers to exclude its main rival advanced micro devices from the worldwide market for x86 computer processing units
1098173 jeopardize the consumers ability to get free content on the internet

1098177 the risk of unintended or deliberate release of information to foreign competitors
1098178 government and its contractors appropriately controlled the export of classified joint strike fighter technology to foreign companies
1098179 did not always employ sufficient controls to evaluate potential unauthorized access to classified u s technology
1098180 advanced aviation and weapons technology in the joint strike fighter program may have been compromised by unauthorized access at facilities and in computers at bae systems
1098181 this is government information and bae is stiff arming the pentagon
1098182 dss failed in its oversight role to ensure that security improved it is unknown if classified information was compromised but it may have been and if it was weak pentagon oversight was a contributing factor
1098183 explicitly found no instances of unauthorized access to classified or export control information on the joint strike fighter program
1098184 we strongly disagree with the igs suggestion that nonetheless such information may have been compromised in some unidentified way by unauthorized access at bae systems
1098185 the f 35 program along with the joint strike fighter program office has put stringent measures in place with our partner companies and global supply chain to keep program information safe
1098186 were in the process of trying to figure it out this is a big loss for the community
1098187 i made a mistake and know what i did was wrong i take responsibility for driving too fast
1098188 who want high quality produce that the consumer can identify where it was grown
1098189 jewish agriculture needs support and we as zionist people view this as our mission
1098190 tobacco figured this out and essentially its the same model
1098191 if you fight the science youre able to postpone regulation and victim compensation as well as in this case eventually the science becomes overwhelming but if you can get five or 10 years of avoiding pollution control or production of chemicals youve greatly increased your product
1098192 the fact is its industrys responsibility to demonstrate the safety of their products
1098193 the fact that industry generated data to support the safety i dont think is an unusual thing
1098194 following world war ii jewish people scattered all over the world
1098195 it is the mission of the lubavitch to reach out to them and bring them back into the faith

1098203 because he wears hassidic clothing the police are trying to pin every instance of haredi violence on him the fact that his fingerprints were taken from the scene of one of these alleged incidents is the only relation my client has to any of the cases they have not yet proven anything concrete

1098215 i think my overall reaction is that its really sad that in 2008 i have people watching every single move i make
1098216 when theres a big game between the cubs and brewers going on its sad that thats what their focus is on and the last thing i had heard is that when you want to do a story on someone you contact them
1098217 with that said i still think reporters should hold themselves to the highest professional standard i found her dress to be inappropriate for the workplace even some brewers players said that although shes great to look at the dress wasnt appropriate for the ballpark
1098218 and i know what all the guys out there are going to say trenni is just being catty because shes jealous
1098219 you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy
1098220 the roads and the streets need to be fixed but the roads like i 279 shouldnt
1098221 it never really looks bad to me to tell you the truth it really doesnt but there are a lot of wrecks here
1098222 im not worried i just take my time and go
1098223 our strength is that we go into it the competition solid we have a plan and we stick to it everything just went like it was supposed to
1098224 its been my experience if you want to win that category you have to have a cheesecake
1098225 we looked around and found the most fattening decadent cheesecake recipe possible
1098226 when i tasted it before the presentation we screwed up the first couple of pieces so i had to eat it but when i tasted it i fully expected it to be in the top two or three
1098227 why spend so much money on space exploration when there are so many starving people here
1098228 i want to thank god for making me 5 foot 3 and 114 pounds so all this could happen

1098233 it was an asinine decision and ill move forward better than i probably have ever had to its the first time in my life that i really havent forgiven myself
1098234 were still waiting on the doctors to give us the timetable on when were going to have this procedure done
1098235 i will not put myself into a position where i have to defend myself to state my side of the story theres no side
1098236 theres only one side a lack of judgment on my part thats really all i have to say i have no excuse all i have is the opportunity to gain the respect of my fans to gain the respect of my family gain the respect of my co workers and gain the respect of the organization
1098237 im a fallen man im a man that made a mistake

1098249 were bigger than that sometimes when emotions are involved you do stupid things for me being a christian i have a forgiving heart and im willing to move forward to help this team win this year
1098250 we still have some more things to talk about as far as what we can we do to be able to go out there and coexist on the same field same team and be productive and help this team win this year
1098251 only two men can do that and feel like we have what it takes in order to do so
1098252 here are the results of preliminary testing over 1 minute cf7 381 pages served blue dragon 1007 pages served so blue dragon served up 164 more pages or 2 6 times the number of pages as cf 7 running on the same server this is very encouraging

1098266 oh a new version came out lets make sure we add a chapter that covers the new features
1098267 i believe that we should evaluate the practices with heightened scrutiny
1098268 i have consistently stated that the four principles are enforceable through the complaint process and adjudications
1098269 right now the agencys principles give the fcc a lot of leeway which is what they want
1098270 none of the evidence suggests that any network provider manages their network for anti competitive reasons rather all of the evidence suggests that they do so to ensure all of their customers have the best possible internet experience
1098271 that would give kevin martin an ironclad way to protect consumers and their right to the content of their choice
1098272 the internet holds incredible potential to resurrect a vibrant industry of independent creators with free access to and distribution of content
1098273 is insanity its disgraceful if ive got something of scientific value that i cant share because of imaginary privacy concerns its crazy thats how we solve crimes
1098274 if practiced routinely we would be subjecting hundreds of thousands of innocent people who happen to be relatives of individuals in the fbi database to lifelong genetic surveillance
1098275 the fbi would be more comfortable with congressional authorization to conduct familial searches
1098276 innocent people dont belong in a so called criminal database
1098277 will provide an additional form of biometric identification from persons who would normally be fingerprinted
1098278 we know for a fact that the proposed regulations will save the lives of many innocent people and will prevent devastating crimes
1098279 these regulations are long overdue we should have done this 10 years ago
1098280 que es eso es un gatito nooo es un perrito parateee

1098284 depending on the type of drug and how long youve been taking it it can remain in your system from one to five days
1098285 to be on the safe side always ask the pharmacist about the effects of your medications on sun exposure theyll go online and get current accurate information
1098286 there have been some bad cases tanning booths primarily emit uva rays and thats what medications mainly interact with
1098287 i recommend spf 15 the stronger sunscreens often give people a false sense of security
1098288 spf 15 is fine for going to and from the store but use spf 30 for longer sun exposure or if youre taking medications
1098289 a problem is that these ingredients arent stable for a very long time
1098290 most people use at best half of what they need if you put it on too thin it doesnt give you protection
1098291 sunscreen wears off when youre sweating or in the water remember to cover your hands and feet with sunscreen too
1098292 next came the patent laws these began in england in 1624 and in this country with the adoption of our constitution before then any man might instantly use what another had invented so that the inventor had no special advantage from his own invention the patent system changed this secured to the inventor for a limited time the exclusive use of his invention and thereby added the fuel of interest to the fire of genius in the discovery and production of new and useful things
1098293 the great difference between young america and old fogy is the result of discoveries inventions and improvements
1098294 why to be sure the force that lifts the pot lid will lift any thing else which is no heavier than the pot lid
1098295 and as man has much hard lifting to do can not this hot water power be made to help him
1098296 why to be sure the force that lifts the pot lid will lift any thing else which is no heavier than the pot lid
1098297 and as man has much hard lifting to do can not this hot water power be made to help him
1098298 for existing construction if we could change the roofing and the vents and defensible space those homes will have a likelihood of survival in the 90 plus range
1098299 this represents one of the largest shifts in our wildfire preparedness culture in a long time
1098300 we have a couple of decades of scientific evidence that is showing us we can fix it with this combination of defensible space and building standards
1098301 its gotten back to a more open condition the way it was in the past
1098302 scenes like this you can see all over southern california
1098303 we can go to places that are invasive grasslands now that are missing a lot of species
1098304 the winters fire took out that mountain and went on for 20 miles
1098305 just the rapidity with which the landscape has changed is unbelievable
1098306 we need to push this concept and push it hard
1098307 the onus and responsibility need to shift to you as a property owner
1098308 process is an embedded reaction to prior stupidity we are often glad of this of course it explains a lot of whats good about the world our knives come equipped with handles
1098309 and our programs include dialog boxes that say are you sure you want to casually delete the last 3 hours of work all because of lessons learned from prior stupidity but but not all stupidity is amenable to deflection by process and even when it is the overhead created by process is often not worth the savings in deflected stupidity stupidity is frequently a one off and a process designed to deflect it within an organization actually ends up embedding it as a negative shape like the outline of wile e coyote just after he is catapaulted through a wall making everyone fill out the form designed to keep you from doing the stupid thing that one guy did three years ago actually emphasizes the sense memoryof that stupid thing within the group caution the beverage you are about to enjoy is extremely hot
1098310 hey thats routing thats great it is just a modelling problem we just have to refine the models until we can express that routing problem hmm ok so we need better ways of categorising our workers more categories and those categories need to be constantly updated to reflect new and changing circumstances and umm and
1098311 we havent seen how bad it can be we build with wood and we have hot dry winds theres no house you can say has a zero chance of ever burning
1098312 i ultimately think the fire problem in southern california is not something fire managers will solve land managers will solve it that is the frontier
1098313 they are natural processes that become disasters because of human decisions why was the subdivision there why was it spread out the way it was
1098314 theres no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved
1098315 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1098316 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1098317 the boys and girls who live with hiv are here and we are growing up with many goals
1098318 we want to be artists teachers doctors even get married and have kids but achieving these goals will only be possible when we receive the attention we need when we are guaranteed the medicines that we need when we are accepted in schools
1098319 its like a little ball that has little dots and is inside me sort of swimming inside me
1098320 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
1098321 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbors
1098322 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent
1098323 i want to congratulate all the boys and girls who have graduated and got good grades
1098324 sometimes i have so much fun that i forget i have this
1098325 het is slim van de overheid om het horeca rookverbod midden in de zomer in te laten gaan nu kunnen rokers nog naar buiten ik ben benieuwd hoe dat straks in de winter gaat
1098326 ze staan met zoveel mensen buiten dat dat geen wonder is
1098327 laat ze maar binnen gaan roken want het is veel te gevaarlijk op straat met al die mensen en de autos die daar dwars doorheen moeten zei de politie
1098328 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1098329 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1098330 i grabbed the wrong box believe me i dont travel with that kind of cash
1098331 just walk around and write stuff down that you could potentially ask for to order food wise for your diet or entertainment wise things that they might actually get you
1098332 i literally had to bring my mentality down to an
1098333 like i love having a good time and having fun and everything but theres absolutely nothing to do in the house
1098334 but to be honest its not really going to change anything
1098335 the hardcore fan has a tendency to know who i am but other than that nothings really changed
1098336 i was hitting 40 hours a week but it allowed me to train pretty much full time monday through thursday
1098337 the show itself like they say its tough man its probably one of the hardest experience anyone can ever go through physically mentally spiritually whatever you want to look at it
1098338 probably the most ridiculous thing ive ever tried to do i naturally walk around at like 195 and i dont even have that much body fat on me
1098339 really really bland to the point where i wanted to shoot myself in the face
1098340 that first fight theyre literally out of their minds if you look at the fight he did absolutely nothing except for two right hands the entire fight except for running around
1098341 theres no doubt in my mind that i would beat him if healthy
1098342 i dont feel that ill probably ever get the chance to prove all the people that doubt that
1098343 and im very well rounded im comfortable standing and on the ground and im very very long i really didnt think that anybody could have beaten me on the show ironically my immune system beat myself
1098344 one of the most boring fights of my entire career because barrera wanted to absolutely nothing apparently but survive
1098345 just some guy that was on a tv show once
1098346 el momento es adecuado para ella muchas mujeres j venes la miran con admiraci n ella es muy dulce una linda chica pero eso es todo
1098347 next year through bribery or trickery i hope to persuade ken bernstein teacher and blogger par excellence to select his favorite blogs and then let me dump on his choices or something like that
1098348 i am disappointed that the irs does not notify a taxpayer when someone else has filed a return using the victims social security number
1098349 processes and procedures have been inadequate in reducing the burden for taxpayers who have been victimized when the irs becomes aware of employment related identity theft it does not take action unless the case relates to a substantive tax or conspiracy violation
1098350 there is no deterrent to keep the problem from spreading
1098351 the question is what have we learned and what are we doing to prevent information security breaches in the future
1098352 a serious violation of our commitment to protect the confidentiality of our patients
1098353 we must do a far better job of protecting data
1098354 in the wrong hands social security numbers let people unlock our lives and steal both our money and our reputations and the government largely has failed to do much about it
1098355 indeed now the government itself is losing social security numbers
1098356 it is clear that the nsl authority is too overbroad and operates unchecked
1098357 we must give our law enforcement the tools they need to protect us but any such powers must be consistent with the rule of law
1098358 its not trusting the goodwill or the angelic disposition of the government to preserve our rights we ought to learn from our experience since 9 11 and restore checks and balances congress cant just rely on the fbi to fix the problem
1098359 by eliyahu m goldratt i hadnt ordered this book but i know its on my wish list so i checked the shipping slip and found that it was ordered by christoph schmitz the manager of the munich

1098363 the primary contractor for the north shore casino will stay on the job for now confident that a group led by chicago billionaire neil bluhm will be able to complete a deal to take over the troubled project
1098364 for now the status quo will remain he said nobody is walking were all of the opinion and belief that this deal can be done and that mr bluhms a very good owner who is capable of financing it if we didnt believe that we would have pulled the plug already he said
1098365 claiming a shroud of secrecy surrounds the quest by chicago billionaire neil bluhm and his group to take over the troubled north shore casino two state senators pressed yesterday for the release of detailed information involving ownership stakes financing and other aspects of the bid in a letter to pennsylvania gaming control board chairwoman mary digiacomo colins sens jim ferlo d highland park and jane orie r mccandless said they have tried without success since july 14 to obtain information relating to the new ownerships corporate structure debt financing organization charts and other matters
1098366 the stock prices for many casino operators have lost half of their value in the past few months but is this the end to gambling as we know it or is now the best time to buy a casino we are inclined to believe the latter and think that the casino gambling decline is close to an end
1098367 in classic harrisburg fashion key lawmakers and casino operators huddled in private to cobble together a rescue plan one lawmaker even placed calls to state gaming board officials raising eyebrows gov rendell met with state rep dwight evans and barden also on his speed dial was neil bluhm a billionaire real estate developer from chicago who is an investor in the proposed sugarhouse slots parlor in philadelphia evans in turn called state gaming control board chairwoman mary digiacomo colins and board member jeff coy next thing you know bluhms been dealt a blackjack his private equity fund emerged as the majority owner of the pittsburgh slots parlor after agreeing to kick in 120 million to complete the project to paraphrase woody allen 80 percent of success is showing up especially with a cashiers check

1098373 the big benefit of quarkxpress 8 is that it manages to make very commonly used operations more efficient and more productive without attaching a big learning curve for example the new picture management tool is designed in such a way that now it lets you do everything including rotating the image rotating the box cropping the image resizing and scaling in one go without ever having to go to a menu
1098374 look you know if you really want to know the truth what wed love to make is fallout nobody is doing anything with it do you think you could go see if you could get it
1098375 ok scrap it throw everything away weve done and lets start over again
1098376 hey listen we have a new solution for doing this and we should do it and take this risk and do it this other way
1098377 i have all these other ideas to make it better
1098378 yeah its taking a little too long to get this one
1098379 i determine the fallout ness of any game in this universe
1098380 i have a fan who is a hardcore fallout fan and he says what he remembers most about fallout is x
1098381 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
1098382 if north american churches do not accept the need for moratoria on same sex blessings and the consecration of gay clergy we are no further forward we continue to be in grave peril
1098383 we are concerned with the continuing patronising attitude of the west towards the rest of the churches
1098384 for people who think that this is going to lead us to disenfranchise any gay or lesbian person they are sadly mistaken
1098385 it sends the wrong message that gays and lesbians are still strangers at the gate
1098386 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
1098387 i feel a great deal of what i hoped for has happened
1098388 weve found that very slowly theres a slightly different way of doing business what we havent had is a very consistent counter narrative flowing through the conference from people feeling disenfranchised
1098389 i felt that archbishop orombis comments slightly misunderstood the role of the archbishop of canterbury as if the archbishop directed the communion its a historical given that this is where this particular mission began from and the archbishop retains permission to convene the communion no one has come up with a coherent alternative
1098390 how would you effect a quick separation it sounds easier than it is actually not easier it just sounds quicker than it possibly could be
1098391 and their language that speaks of two churches i dont think thats been the experience of the overwhelming majority of the people at this conference what you see at the eucharist every morning is not two churches
1098392 every conference ive been to has that rhythm where at some point everybody loses confidence in the process but when things went wobbly it was important to say that we dont try to revise the conferences agenda on the back of an envelope and theres a theology to it its something to do with a belief that unity is an active matter not just a goal to be achieved
1098393 id expect it to feel physically tiring because its a long physical day jane and i both thought wed commit to the process so we pray with everybody in the morning
1098394 on the few evenings weve been able to knock off by 9 pm and unwind a bit thats helped with coping
1098395 those are moments when you think the communion really matters because those people can bring a global perspective to a local situation
1098396 there may be a complicated development issue that we can broker to introduce people from that sort of world to people in government here over the past couple of weeks is what this is about these relationships are not a waste of time
1098397 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
1098398 almost every time you read an article commenting on people who for religious reasons disapprove of homosexual marriage practising homosexuals becoming priests and so on you find the word bigot used even intelligent commentators seem to think it unarguable that such attitudes are bigoted why to this day all the mainstream monotheistic religions of the world take the view that homosexual acts are wrong and they have reasons of scripture and wider moral teaching to back this up believers who maintain that view in the face of modern social pressure are only following their faith just as christians would be if they opposed polygamy suttee or euthanasia the word bigoted does have an accepted meaning it does not mean religious or even fervently religious bigotry is the obstinate and blind often nasty and hypocritical attachment to a particular creed no doubt some people who oppose gay marriages are indeed like this venting hatred towards homosexuals which their religion forbids but many are decent conscientious and thoughtful isnt it rather bigoted in fact to assume that your opponents on certain subjects are bigots it is like the way anyone who criticises islamist extremism will find himself described as islamophobic
1098399 theres a great love of the doctor in there its the doctor lite episode and the absence of him becomes very powerful
1098400 purely for catherine tate s performance which is my favourite thing ive seen in years
1098401 its impossible to get an even slightly complicated message across in this day and age
1098402 a form of communication that was never meant to happen
1098403 it is four pages of handwritten notes from my initial walk through with lois and she walked through room by room and told me move this take this off the wall pack this move furniture she did the whole thing in just a walk through
1098404 i would say 85 percent of my listings i have staged mainly because i just feel that it has to be the best thats out there
1098405 suck it up because the sooner the house is presented well the quicker its going to sell
1098406 dhoni has been declared the recipient of the rajiv gandhi khel ratna award the countrys most prestigious sports award
1098407 he has represented the country with distinction and deserves the honour
1098408 his exemplary leadership and demeanour under pressure especially in the icc world twenty20 and the tri series in australia mark him out as the ideal role model for millions of young indians who want to make a mark in life
1098409 the selectors had a decision to make they spoke long and hard about which direction they wanted to go in strauss said
1098410 if they wanted a captain for all three formats including twenty20 the list would have been short im not involved in two of the formats and alastair cook hasnt been in the twenty20 side recently
1098411 i would have liked to have done the test job and to that degree i am disappointed i have not been given the opportunity
1098412 it is a brave decision because kp pietersen hasnt done much captaincy before but i think he has matured a lot in the last couple of years strauss said
1098413 we are all very sad michael has decided to step down having been such an influential figure in the dressing room it is going to take some used to someone else being in charge
1098414 it is a big job ive done it a few times and you only had to see how much it meant to michael vaughan to realise it is an encompassing job
1098415 it is going to be a massive job he will have an abundance of confidence to believe he can do it and he will have the full support of all the players around him
1098416 kp is a very decisive person and i am sure he will feel he is up to the challenge it is a bit of a step into the unknown because he hasnt captained before but it is a new start for us he said
1098417 i think he does play for the team i think that selfish aspect is overplayed he would probably admit in his youth he was a bit like that but i dont think he is like that so much now
1098418 the one thing i would say about kevin is everything he has done in his career so far he has easily stepped up to the mark and found a way to deal with it he said
1098419 he is an exceptional batsman and it would take quite a lot for something external to affect his batting
1098420 i thought straussy had a really good chance too but theyve chosen kevin and hes got some really good people around him cook said
1098421 hes an excellent batter and demands respect with his batting hes also not shy of making the big decisions those big decisions are not going to affect that style of guy
1098422 he hasnt done too much captaining before so it will be interesting but all i know is he has the support of everyone
1098423 thank you environmentalists for making the 2002 fire season all it could be
1098424 we would be cutting the trees we should be leaving
1098425 you know the difference between you and me i make this look good
1098426 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
1098427 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
1098428 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
1098429 the demon is a liar he will lie to confuse us but he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us the attack is psychological but powerful so dont listen remember that do not listen
1098430 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
1098431 im very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain england
1098432 its a huge honour and a terrific challenge for me at this stage of my international career
1098433 i have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both michael and paul and fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job of captaining your country
1098434 they are big shoes that i have to fill but i will give it the best possible go it is a great honour
1098435 it is something that has turned my life around in the last 24 hours it has been a very emotional time for me
1098436 time will tell but i hope it wont restrict the way i play ive been successful with my style and i would be foolish to change that
1098437 in choosing a new captain we were keen to identify a player who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role of captain
1098438 hmm im gonna have to follow up on this band someday this is exciting
1098439 we wound up doing it because there wasnt a lot of credibility when we just asked lumberyards if the wood was responsibly harvested
1098440 this is by far the best smelling finishing room youll ever be in

1098442 a teacher teaches in a systematized and organized way a master catches you shakes you and wakes you up
1098443 a young man once came to a great rabbi and asked him to make him a rabbi

1098451 in fallen earth a vehicle can mean the difference between being run down by a pack of mutant dogs and actually surviving your cargo run to traders flat in the wastelands a vehicle isnt just a convenience it can be a fortress on wheels a place to store your gear and the fastest way out of danger but in the wastes there is one thing a vehicle never is cheap
1098452 t oo many people feel pressured to alter their appearance in order to achieve social and financial success in america
1098453 i took a bunch of contributors off the list i just thought it was the right thing to do
1098454 i just did it i thought it was the right thing to do
1098455 i dont know anything about the governor or chris kelly
1098456 i dont recall the reason why mr rossi was taken off the list
1098457 then i got a request for a contribution the next year

1098459 twenty years after an irishman couldnt get a fucking job we had the presidency may he rest in peace thats what the niggers dont realize if i got one thing against the black chappies its this no one gives it to you you have to take it
1098460 its not like im totally without experience youre talking to a former governor i was the commander in chief of the new hampshire national guard wed just stand on the border and stare you down then wed all go for pancakes
1098461 to be a good soldier you must love the army to be a good commander you must be able to order the death of the thing you love
1098462 impacts on individual species indicate wider changes at the biome level that will potentially change conditions for many plant and animal species in addition to ecosystem services to humans
1098463 the central u s is characterized by an ecotone thats the intersection of forest in the east and grassland in the west
1098464 the border between these ecosystems is largely determined by climate variability and it is likely that climate change will shift the location of this and other ecological boundaries worldwide
1098465 however it was made at least a little bit more efficient by the fact we had the sporadic cell phone conversation which was a whole lot better than no information at all
1098466 to close small plants it will be very effective to improve air quality
1098467 theres no co benefit to doing the carbon capture and storage
1098468 theres an argument for doing greengen in terms of research and getting experience with it but from a commercial point of view it doesnt make sense
1098469 it may well be in this environment where oil is above 100 a barrel that it is economically viable and valuable for nations that are rich in coal like china to use that coal and to sequester the co2 for purposes of producing more oil
1098470 view it as being a long term benefit to remove co2
1098471 when i was young the sky was green and we could not see stars at night

1098474 offsets such as the projects that nrg has committed to invest in are a low cost way to get the large reductions in greenhouse gases that are necessary to prevent catastrophic impacts of global warming and nrg has established a precedent for other electricity companies to follow
1098475 developing and utilizing renewables shall be an important part of building a new socialist countryside
1098476 china is already one of the top renewable energy producers in the world
1098477 renewable energy can provide 50 percent of the energy needs in china
1098478 all the good wind farm locations are now owned by the biggest energy companies
1098479 because land is very precious in china some places will not be allowed to build wind farms
1098480 china has the largest wind resources in the world and three quarters of them are offshore
1098481 the reality in china is they develop wind farms too fast
1098482 the local market is very limited because pv is too expensive
1098483 its a waste of all the production in china it doesnt make sense
1098484 to stop global warming its not an excuse to destroy the local environment
1098485 within 30 to 50 years hydro will be the main energy we should rely on
1098486 i had my first orgasm with the silver bullet i massaged around my clit and all over my vagina and even my nipples until i felt really hot then i turned it on the clit alone the intensity of the middle speed was just right i felt like goldilocks not too soft and not too hard please i couldnt believe the sensations just like women describe them it was so intense i was shaking and crying afterward

1098704 young gore sets out for his new home where the sky is clear the water is clean and there are no republicans
1098705 former vice president al gore who for the past three decades has unsuccessfully attempted to warn humanity of the coming destruction of our planet only to be mocked and derided by the very people he has tried to save launched his infant son into space monday in the faint hope that his only child would reach the safety of another world
1098706 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
1098707 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
1098708 not an authentic culture and is probably a bad one

1098712 largest criminal fines and civil sic settlements in canadian history
1098713 aiding persons to sell and be in possession of tobacco manufactured in canada that was not packed and was not stamped in conformity with the excise act and its amendments and ministerial regulations
1098714 black markets always develop when the state tries to ban or severely restrict something consumers want as the long history of tobacco alcohol prostitution banned books etc amply demonstrates black markets are a way for consumers to reassert their sovereignty whatever you i or others think of this or that product traded on them long live the black market
1098715 nobody owned the mine nobody could afford the cost of working it but a young man with a brusque voice and dark angry eyes who came from a starving settlement had organized a gang of the unemployed and made a deal with rearden to deliver the coal they mined it at night they stored it in hidden culverts they were paid in cash with no questions asked or answered guilty of a fierce desire to remain alive they and rearden traded like savages without rights with nothing but mutual understanding and a ruthless absolute observance of ones given word rearden did not even know the name of the young leader watching him at the job of loading the trucks rearden thought that this boy if born a generation earlier would have become a great industrialist now he would probably end his brief life as a plain criminal in a few more years
1098716 now you see we dont have on one side bad egoists who are just thinking of making a buck with wicked consumers and on the other side statocratic angels sacrificing themselves for the love of their subjects men dont transmogrify from egoists to altruists when they leave the market to become politicians or bureaucrats they remain the same
1098717 the looters are also very happy with the new surveillance and control powers they have gained over the two tobacco manufacturers
1098718 black markets always develop when the state tries to ban or severely restrict something consumers want black markets are a way for consumers to reassert their sovereignty long live the black market
1098719 fine but because tobacco only harms the user draconian taxes make it a clear case of bad paternalism so there
1098720 so black markets and underground economies are created every time any government seeks to restrict free exchanges between people who are both happy to make the exchange
1098721 the scale and size of this embassy set on 10 acres in a new diplomatic zone symbolizes the future of the relationship as it expands in scope and breadth

1098768 john mccain says we need offshore oil drilling and we need it now senator barack obama has consistently opposed offshore drilling calling it a gimmick senator obamas solution to high gas prices is telling americans to make sure their tires are inflated
1098769 today im asking for your help in putting senator obamas tire gauge energy policy to the test
1098770 you can improve your gas mileage by around 3 3 percent by keeping your tires inflated to the proper pressure under inflated tires can lower gas mileage by 0 4 percent for every 1 psi drop in pressure of all four tires properly inflated tires are safer and last longer fuel economy benefit up to 3 equivalent gasoline savings up to 0 09 gallon
1098771 big oils filling john mccains campaign with 2 million dollars in contributions after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another

1098777 i heard a rumor that one of the pants designs is supposed to make your bum look fantastic thats the one i want to try on
1098778 try the groove pants i think you will be pleasantly surprised they are great they are reversible and the inner waistband has a stash pocket to secure your money and keys
1098779 you wont hear me say this too often but i couldnt agree more with the explanation that senator mccain offered a few weeks ago
1098780 what senator mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them
1098781 george bushs own energy department has said that if we opened up new areas to drilling today we wouldnt see a single drop of oil for seven years
1098782 now increased domestic oil exploration certainly has its place as we make our economy more fuel efficient and transition to other renewable american made sources of energy but it is not the solution it is a political answer of the sort washington has given us for three decades
1098783 there are genuine ways in which we can provide some short term relief from high gas prices relief to the mother whos cutting down on groceries because of gas prices or the man i met in pennsylvania who lost his job and cant even afford to drive around and look for a new one
1098784 i also believe that in the short term as we transition to renewable energy we can and should increase our domestic production of oil and natural gas
1098785 but the truth is none of these steps will come close to seriously reducing our energy dependence in the long term we simply cannot pretend as senator mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem we need a much bolder and much bigger set of solutions we have to make a serious nationwide commitment to developing new sources of energy and we have to do it right away

1098803 one tick species making its way to new parts of the country is the deer tick ixodes scapularis the primary transmitter of lyme disease in eastern north america
1098804 recent data show that deer ticks now can be found from minnesota to florida from texas to maine and from kansas to virginia
1098805 that means lyme disease and or other diseases associated with the deer tick such as anaplasmosis may exist throughout all of those regions
1098806 medical doctors and veterinarians are finding that coinfections in both humans and pets are making treatment for tick borne diseases more difficult
1098807 with more ticks carrying more diseases screening your pet becomes all the more important
1098808 as family pets dogs have followed a trend in moving from the backyard to the bedroom in recent years
1098809 dogs and their owners share more of the same space in the home creating opportunities for ticks to move from pet to owner

1098871 lets all individually have as many children as we can but then hunt down and cannibalize each others children especially the girls

1098878 the suburbs they need either massive improvement or outright banishment and i dont mean big government makes them illegal i mean people choose to top building them suburbs are a perfect example of conspicuous consumption and environmental inefficiency people want the best of both worlds the order and civilization of urban life but the vast spreadoutness of rural life this leads to very wasteful housing transportation and general life practices
1098879 since the polar ice caps and glaciers are melting into the ocean would it be a good idea to harvest this ice for fresh drinking water
1098880 i had wondered this same thing until i asked a professor who specializes in global water systems the whole planet is one big system any melting of the ice whether it is done in the arctic by global temperature increases or in the desert due to thirsty esert dwellers will contribute to the same problems the sea level will still rise and the amount of fresh water in the oceans will increase even more by harvesting it you end up speeding up the already fast process plus you have to dump unreasonable amounts of pollution into the air and burn unreasonable amounts of nonrenewable resources in order to harvest the ice
1098881 actually yeah for the most part it is heres why i can turn my heat coolness off and forget about it i get caught up with other stuff and dont notice that im a little hot or cold its just become second nature but when im really hungry that just slaps me right in the face theres no ignoring it you have to eat sadly in the majority of the country if youre out and about and need a full meal fast your options are limited and usually limited to meaty things so it takes more of a conscious effort for me to think ahead buy vegetarian stuff at the store bring it home and have it constantly on hand but it think that anything worth doing is worth doing well and the idea that everything should be fast and effortless has run away with our commonsense so i am working always toward lowering and lowering my intake of environmentally damaging foods as well as reducing my own personal dependence on fossil fuels and electricity everyone needs to pitch in and pitch in in a holistic fashion
1098882 why have you not yet put a garden on top of your roof
1098883 i havent done this yet yes i knew about it before because i live in a multi unit apartment building as progressive as i would like to imagine my town is i cant see the zoning permit people let alone the apartment owners jumping all over the idea once i have my own place hopefully a fun little brownstone in the city i will be immediately looking into the specifics of green roofing with a percentage of space devoted to a garden also contrary to popular belief you can fairly easily install a green roof on a pre existing slanted roof
1098884 are there really more trees in the us than ever before
1098885 i think the statistic many in the anti environmental movement like to use is that there are more trees now then there were 100 years ago this is a stupid point to make considering
1098886 so the original number of trees in america and globally has been much higher that what it is now
1098887 the carbon footprint is such a cliche and pop culture way to look at things the environmental impact of this war and any war is staggering we are taking planes ships and ground vehicles half way around the world to blow up buildings that required natural resources to build then were rebuilding them in inefficient western style ways then hanging around angering the locals to the point that they blow something up which we then have to rebuild again and blow something of theirs up to get back at them the whole country is like a black hole for natural resources and thats not even mentioning the human cost

1098890 do supermarkets really have a negative impact on the natural environment
1098891 oh bell youre englishness is showing here in america in most places we didnt fight for local shops and now all we have are huge supermarkets and the majority of those are huge national or multinational chains like walmart supermarkets that are part of the multinational system are bad for the environment in many ways they create a huge footprint taking up alot of land they are one centralized location that everyone has to drive to rather than numerous decentralized small shops scattered around a neighborhood in the battle for low prices they often purchase goods that are from other countries and have to be shipped here the places where they buy their goods often have relaxed environmental standards which cause them to emit more pollution for the same amount of goods that could be made here as prices are dropped artificially low for any array of items people are influenced to be more wasteful and consumeristic many of the products that are sold are of low quality break easily and are not designed to be fixed finally the large supermarkets are often poorly designed they have little to no windows and rely heavily on electricity for heating cooling and light a small local store could have been built or retrofitted to take advantage of natural light and passive heating and cooling
1098892 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1098893 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1098894 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
1098895 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
1098896 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

1098953 its a little bit like a free lunch without the calories
1098954 that has taken a lot of pressure off the market it looks like the thinking is that we dodged another bullet
1098955 any market that really doesnt respond to seemingly bullish news is often a tip off that were going lower
1098956 people are looking for any excuse to sell oil right now
1098957 they still have expensive gas to feed into the system so theyre reluctant to drop prices
1098958 prices never come down as fast as they go up
1098959 the market is increasing the odds now that the drilling deal will get done and we will see more production coming out of the gulf of mexico
1098960 hell just be a little tropical storm tike compared to big mammas that rip things up and spike gas prices
1098961 utterly astonished astounded its much stronger than just being surprised its used for something that leaves you speechless or otherwise stops you dead in your tracks it suggests that something is as surprising as being suddenly hit in the face
1098962 recently i have also been advised that some of the ioc officials had negotiated with the chinese that some sensitive sites would be blocked
1098963 if you have been misled by what i have told you about there being free internet access during the games then i apologise
1098964 i hear you we are both friends and whatever assurances you need to keep you happy we will gladly give
1098965 let me be very clear on this we require that different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and im adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
1098966 im not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for
1098967 we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet
1098968 foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
1098969 again i think we are trying to hang on every single word often spoken by people whose mother tongue isnt english let me be clear again the ioc would like to see open access for the media to be able to do their job
1098970 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
1098971 we are idealists and idealism is something that is linked with naivety but we fight for causes that we think are important and we want the media to work in the best possible way
1098972 we have always had an understanding and we havent necessarily talked about it that any sovereign government will block pornographic sites and what they might consider subversive or sites which are contrary to the national interest
1098973 i would suggest also that we are not working in a democratic society were working in a communist society this is china and they are proud to be a communist society so it will be different
1098974 i believe we are now on the way to getting there
1098975 i have absolute assurance from the president of the ioc that no new arrangements have been entered into with the local organizing committee bocog or the chinese authorities in respect to censorship for the international press to report on the games
1098976 a deep loyalty to their communities combined with a variety of personal grievances against enemy forces

1098978 to see her as entirely coerced then seems to make invisible the quite significant agency that she must have exercised to undertake a terror bombing attack perhaps its simply easier not to acknowledge that women might strongly hold extremist beliefs and be willing to engage in terrorist action

1098982 my sole concern is the money was used for party purposes but getting a straight answer from new zealand first is a recipe for disappointment
1098983 if the money has not reached the party it constitutes theft if i receive another evasive reply then clearly it is a matter for the police
1098984 yes the money was spent on behalf of nz first
1098985 two went in saturday and so there was no more rehearsals and today sunday all the rehearsals were called off
1098986 the kids are completely dehydrated two of them im sure theyre doing a lot of blood work to see if theres anything else

1098994 what a waste of time the retirement calculator told me i had to save over 700 000 00 this year
1098995 our culture is that we want to be very careful about those pieces that we put on stage and we dont want to take that feel of the show away from the guests
1098996 let china be we now have other priorities that are not china
1098997 at this moment china is not a country at war with us if there are attacks against muslims these hit the dispossessed that must leave those lands and move to islamic countries
1098998 bothersome actions like these are not foreseen by islamic sharia law or good sense
1098999 what interest do we have in turning china against muslims at the moment
1099000 at this moment holy warriors mujahadeen do not need to open a new front with china
1099001 we must be very careful and have patience we do not need to rush and shout god is great or justify this type of action for all i know i have never heard any of the al qaeda leaders threaten china

1099197 by treating illegal low wage workers as a de facto criminal class the government is trying to inflate the menace they pose to a level that justifies its rabid efforts to capture and punish them that is a fraudulent exercise and a national disgrace
1099198 just as the gilded age gave way to the progressive era and the new deal gave way to the post war era of big government the current era of free market capitalism seems to be giving way to something else
1099199 theres a lot of evidence to support the idea that when kids watch violent media they become more aggressive
1099200 and yet violent media has become easier and easier to access for children so for the movie industry the message is that the 1960s ratings system needs to be updated and made more explicit and relevant to the way movies are being distributed and seen today
1099201 but also parents need to be much more careful about how their children consume violent media
1099202 and in any case the american movie industry rates itself
1099203 so how and why some movies get an r rating while others dont isnt always rational because its like the fox watching the chicken coop and the industry is not going to do anything that limits it from getting as wide an audience as possible
1099204 theres quite a lot of validity to what these researchers are saying
1099205 children are definitely far more able to access this kind of violent material and its potentially worrying but the evidence isnt really there yet that theres a negative consequence
1099206 but there just arent any studies that have shown a direct connection to problem behavior and what the connection is independent of a host of other factors for example children who are more violent in the first place tend to be the ones drawn more to material that is more violent so even the direction of any relationship is not clear
1099207 oh and while you try to catchup we want to penalize you by getting a rebate on our fares
1099208 the corporate tax rate reduction would apply to all corporations
1099209 obama is cherry picking here the corporate tax rate reduction would apply to all corporations yes exxon mobil but also to wal mart general motors and home depot to name a few of the other fortune 50 biggies even everybodys favorite starbucks would get the same tax break obamas statement is technically true but singling out oil companies suggests mccain has targeted oil companies for tax breaks he hasnt we rate obamas statement and the claim in the ad barely true
1099210 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
1099211 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
1099212 the last release of oil from the strategic reserve came in response to hurricane katrina but the only crisis that has developed since barack obama last rejected this idea two months ago is a slide in his poll numbers
1099213 hopefully we get a little community going here in toronto amp maybe have some fun making some new friends

1099219 its an exciting thing in a patient who has had conventional therapy and failed
1099220 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face its gonna take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1099221 proposal to reduce energy costs in the u s will not work unless we also simultaneously curb u s population growth by reducing immigration and curbing teen pregnancies
1099222 what heartens me as i hear the speeches of the men and women gathered around me is that i know in my heart we are speaking and giving voice to the will of the overwhelming majority of the american people who want this congress to return to washington d c and give the american people more access to american oil
1099223 im absolutely confident that if this congress were brought back to washington d c and given an opportunity to vote on giving more access to the american people of american oil that there is a bipartisan majority in the congress that would pass that measure
1099224 democrats offered a real solution to high energy prices that would bring immediate relief within 10 days by forcing the president to free our oil from the nations stockpile
1099225 the republicans propose to give away public lands to big oil which will not immediately reduce the price at the pump and save americans only 2 cents 10 years from now this republican hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to reduce the price at the pump and promote energy independence
1099226 in my district youll see a lot of wind turbines
1099227 youll see a lot of activities in labs for research and development of biodiesel and other renewables and alternatives its poised to be one of the leading districts in the nation on renewables
1099228 but what youll also see is a lot of oil and gas activity especially in weld county where theres great agriculture going on and yet a lot of exploration
1099229 meanwhile most of their republican colleagues returned home burdened with trying to explain why they blocked efforts to combat high gas prices
1099230 republicans voted against expanding drilling in alaska against promoting renewable energy against establishing the first new vehicle efficiency standards in 32 years against repealing taxpayer subsidies for major oil companies that are making record profits against cracking down on price gouging and against curbing excessive speculation in energy markets
1099231 for six years republicans controlled every branch of government and did nothing while america became more dependent on foreign sources of oil
1099232 i loaded up the minivan with our four children just like the griswolds and we drove through the night
1099233 you sense the change that is happening in the debate
1099234 you sense the change that the presumptive nominee of the democratic party senator obama is beginning to see the light on this and we welcome him to see the light on this
1099235 i think if we can continue to push continue to push continue to push then ultimately the american people are going to be winners
1099236 the truth is none of these steps will come close to seriously reducing our energy dependence in the long term
1099237 we need a much bolder and much bigger set of solutions
1099238 obama believes that the doubling of oil prices in the past year is crisis for millions of americans
1099239 and the transfer of wealth to oil producing countries many of them hostile to our interests is a threat to our national security
1099240 no country for old men this man in this case
1099241 barr ella though neither one of them is likely to object if they escape this treatment
1099242 web ad likening obama to moses and the mccain campaign tv ad likening obama to britney spears and paris hilton
1099243 being compared to moses could hardly be considered a negative attack
1099244 i frankly think barack obama has been a media event in some respects romney suggested
1099245 there really has not been an inspection of what he stands for and what hed do for the country
1099246 really points out that he is a celebrity and a phenomenon but not a leader
1099247 i think its both ways barack he wanted to have it both ways
1099248 democrat for mccain though he holds his seat in the senate as an independent had this to say about that messianic web ad of mccains featuring charlton heston as moses
1099249 in my book thats about as good a comparison as you could ask for lieberman said on
1099250 i should say in the book its about as good a comparison as you could ask for
1099251 i think the people of america select a president they dont care so much who the vice president is
1099252 he may be tempted to wait until after barack obama makes his choice last up best dressed
1099253 i do not believe that we should use the strategic oil reserves at this point i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said that we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency you have a situation lets say where there was a major oil facility in saudi arabia that was destroyed as a consequence of terrorist acts and you suddenly had huge amounts of oil taken out of the world market we wouldnt just be seeing 4 a gallon oil we could see a situation where entire sectors of the country had no oil to function at all and thats what the strategic oil reserve has to be for
1099254 its such an irony that now she relies on others to care for her
1099255 this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to witness this moment in history
1099256 played for the pleasantville all stars last two seasons first line center hes got great hands a wicked shot and led the team in scoring last year

1099340 a new cnn poll just came out about the campaign interesting results a new study shows that wine drinkers prefer hillary clinton to the other candidates yeah after hearing this bill clinton asked how much wine have they had i guess this is good news former new york governor eliot spitzer has reportedly entered therapy for a sex addiction spitzer said his therapy is going well and that his therapist has a fantastic rack in new jersey today there were dangerous winds with gusts up to 50 miles an hour the winds were so strong that they blew former governor mcgreevey off his chauffeur well of course this sunday is easter of course easter is that very very holy day when christians around the world honor a 2 000 year old jewish man who is not larry king a big insurance company just announced they will give 10 million to anyone who can invent a car that gets 100 miles per gallon meanwhile exxon says theyll give 11 million to anyone who kills that guy
1099341 when people in this worn looking city near pittsburgh lament how the sagging economy is slowly crushing them some are also quick to add how much hillary clinton could help them
1099342 with that in mind i believe that the best candidate for philadelphia is the one who has not only ideas but the skills to implement them is willing to embrace change while also working in collaboration with us at the local level is experienced and willing to extend a helping hand and possesses both good judgment and a profound sense of social justice based on those criteria ive made my decision on which candidate i support i have endorsed senator hillary clinton hillary clinton has an impressive 35 year record of fighting on behalf of working families and children fighting for universal health care for every american and has a comprehensive plan to end the war in iraq and restore our standing around the world but most importantly she has a strong commitment to revitalizing our urban centers and i believe that under her leadership our american cities will rise again the hillary clinton agenda for revitalizing philadelphia and other major metropolitan areas is called leave no city behind and it creates a vital partnership between our efforts here in philadelphia and the efforts of the federal government
1099343 pledging to work her heart out if elected president democratic candidate u
1099344 we need to send someone who can be commander in chief and president

1099364 we saw near commercial quality coding and documentation from the hundreds of hours these students and professors committed
1099365 the innovate canada finalists demonstrated a great deal of creativity and an ability to work together as teams to solve real world problems
1099366 software hardware partitioning was a common theme in these projects reflecting an increased emphasis today on co design methods

1099368 their design methods show a good understanding of engineering fundamentals and the resulting application appears highly extendable the analysis and presentation of their results were professional
1099369 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented and fabulous your playing small doesnt serve the world there is nothing enlightening about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god within us it is not just in some of us its in everyone and as we let our light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others

1099376 there have been individuals throughout history alex baumann is a great example victor davis is a great example greg joy is a great example lots of people have been that outspoken about wanting to win in the past
1099377 i think the biggest problem if there is a problem with speaking out like that is that canadians think its a strong stance
1099378 often people say yeah i want to win a medal because they think its bad to say i want to win theres nothing wrong with that thats what competition is all about
1099379 we will get the medals that we get and people will prepare with the resources that we have
1099380 we can say i only believe in gold im here for gold none of that matters if you prepared properly and you execute properly and your potential is to win you will win it wont depend on whether you said you were going to do your best or promised gold
1099381 weve had unfortunately a lot of injuries in the last two years
1099382 we acknowledge that we should have done better in communicating this to the residents but the work will go ahead
1099383 we havent heard anything from the council yet but we hope that they may now give us a chance to put our view
1099384 we are not opposed to the removal of diseased or dying trees but we want the council to replace them so we still have trees along the street
1099385 we appreciate some residents have strong feelings about the trees but the issue remains that a number are unsafe and need to come down
1099386 the pavements are heavily used particularly by children on their way to the local primary school and we have a duty to make them as safe as possible this means felling a number of trees that are already dead and pruning the roots of those that have caused the pavement to buckle
1099387 this work will be carried out at the same time as traffic calming measures are introduced on the street as part of a safe routes to school scheme
1099388 though we have held a number of meetings with residents over the past few years we recognise on reflection that we should have made them aware that work was actually about to start setting out again why this work is necessary
1099389 we apologise for this and are happy to discuss with residents any concerns they may have
1099390 as a principle we always look to replace every tree that we remove but that is unfortunately not an option along pine grove
1099391 the volume of utility cables and pipes means that new trees cannot be planted in the same locations and narrow streets prevent us from indenting them into the road itself

1099444 and i say this mornings or this afternoons its only partly a joke
1099445 but being a cop you get cynical and you learn to trust your gut
1099446 when humans left africa they had h pylori in their stomachs it was universal and its now clear that h pylori is disappearing ulcer diseases and stomach cancers are going away but new diseases are appearing including asthma and related disorders
1099447 we use the analogy of flooding if you build a high enough levee it doesnt matter how much it rains but with no levee theres a flood the th17 cells are the levee
1099448 embryologically the lung is derived from gastrointestinal tissue our hypothesis is that having enough th17 cells in childhood sets the threshold for allergic sensitization
1099449 children with h pylori have plenty of these cells but children without have few of them thats kind of a smoking gun
1099450 organisms weve had inside us for thousands even millions of years are vanishing h pylori is the best example and when you have an organism with us for a very long time that disappears there will be consequences
1099451 rather than trying to stay on top of things i am trying to get to the bottom of things
1099452 a bandoning the internet in 2003 and the cell phone network in 2006 my netzwissenschaft link page is completely out of date its time to bid farewell
1099453 oh thats just for kids business people nerds college students etc
1099454 do something if it doesnt work do something else no idea is too crazy
1099455 once he makes it through that first year hell be ok after that
1099456 weve always seen a lot of great great athletes who decide to try that one more year and its a disappointment ive always felt badly that reggie white came back and played that year at carolina because he wasnt the same reggie white and i think itd be very sad to see that this wasnt the same brett favre he has been so magnificent he went out on top great season great team record its a great way for him to exit and add to his legacy
1099457 i know i can play but i dont think i want to its been a great career for me but its over
1099458 as they say all good things must come to an end i look forward to whatever the future may hold for me
1099459 i promised i wouldnt get emotional ive watched hundreds of players retire and you wonder what that would be like
1099460 i hope that with every penny the packers have spent on me they know it was money well spent it wasnt about the money or fame or records i hear people talk about your accomplishments and things it was never my accomplishments it was our accomplishments
1099461 im going out on top believe me i could care less what other people think its what i think and im going out on top
1099462 i dont even want to think about next year will i watch games im sure i will will i be involved i always made the joke id be here for an honorary coin toss well that time may come so i may be back for something like that but as far as giving advice i dont think that will happen
1099463 the season opening game is always an exciting event and now were very pleased to add the retirement of bretts no 4 to that evening it will make for an electric atmosphere at lambeau field as well as a great opportunity for our fans around the country to share in it while watching the game on the national broadcast
1099464 ted thompson mike mccarthy and i looked at the entire schedule and felt the first game would be an ideal time to have the event i spoke with brett as did ted and mike about which game to choose ultimately through our communications we decided the first game would work great
1099465 i guess the best response would be right now no
1099466 there are always second thoughts but thats not saying i am coming back its never a clear cut decision its something i cant expect everyone to understand no theres no perfect time
1099467 some of our guys play madden better than they play on sundays and they spend more time talking about playing madden
1099468 hes felt like that for the last couple of years that the packers didnt really want him back
1099469 ive talked to brett and i know he has the itch to come back and play if he will or not i dont know but i know hes feeling he wants to play
1099470 as a veteran and as a leader of the team i would welcome brett with open arms
1099471 we embrace aaron we support aaron aaron is our quarterback brett is retired but if he wants to come back there will be some guys that wouldnt mind it
1099472 we value bretts legacy we think he values it and wed want to protect that bretts a high quality person and hes not going to push it that far hell do the right thing and stay retired this was almost predictable the idea that brett would get the itch to play as we get closer to the season
1099473 im not brett favre and if theyre wanting me to be the next brett favre im not going to be him im aaron rodgers thats who i am
1099474 im in a good situation ive got a great team around me a lot of people are focusing on what im going to do its what the teams going to do really im an important part of that i know my role and i need to play it well
1099475 brett earned and exercised the right to retire on his terms we wanted him to return and welcomed him back on more than one occasion bretts press conference and subsequent conversations in the following weeks illustrated his commitment to retirement the finality of his decision to retire was accepted by the organization at that point the green bay packers made the commitment to move forward with our football team
1099476 weve communicated that to brett that we have since moved forward at the same time weve never said that there couldnt be some role that he might play here but i would understand his point that he would want to play
1099477 i dont want to deal in hypotheticals brett is still retired i know that there has been a lot of publicity about him being released but if he applies for reinstatement he will go back on the green bay packers active roster and we will deal with it then
1099478 we were going to leave the owners meeting in west palm bech fla a day early and fly to hattiesburg with the idea of sitting down and talking to him about coming back to the team
1099479 that was the first time july 8 that id ever heard him say he was committed and he continually from june 21 to july 8 told james campen that he was not going to play so thats a pretty important piece of the puzzle
1099480 we dont know where everything is going to go its been a distraction its been a distraction for our fans im trying to stay steady and do the right things for the packers and do the right thing for brett favre i care about the legacy of brett favre i care about the legacy of the green bay packers
1099481 quite frankly its a little gut wrenching as an organization to go through it and certainly for mike and myself this stuff hurts a lot of people i mean it hurts im not talking about physically hurting but the sensitivity we understand where the fans are coming from this is a hot button issue that surpasses anything ive ever gone through
1099482 brett we welcome you back well play you 12 million but youve got to hold the clipboard and ball cap thats probably better for them as opposed to letting me go somewhere and me coming back then their legacy the management could be in jeopardy let me worry about that you dont worry about my legacy its a bunch of bull thats all it is
1099483 we wanted to create a forum for fans voices to be heard i dont understand how you deny somebody that threw for 4 000 yards last season a starting position i can think of at least 25 teams in the nfl that would jump at the opportunity to have brett favre be their starting quarterback
1099484 im shocked that there hasnt been more support from the fans this is a hall of famer were talking about and last i checked the team is owned by the stockholders not the front office
1099485 maybe this shows that more than a few people are sick of and fed up with brett i personally think he should just show up on the first day of training camp and compete for the starting job like anybody else
1099486 theres no way hes going to be back in that locker room now
1099487 understand that it is a business and that at some point it is going to come down to business over feelings players have to understand that it is going to come down to that whether its peyton manning brett favre jerry rice joe montana ronnie lott eventually it is going to come to a point when the team says as great as your were its diminishing returns now and weve got to move on theres a lesson for all of us coaches general managers players you can be replaced
1099488 i think the packers are making a mistake if they dont want favre back thats one thing release him let him go to another team but dont tell him he can come back but hes going to be a backup thats not fair to brett favre and everything hes done for the organization
1099489 ive worked closely with ted thompson and mike mccarthy on this and they have my full support
1099490 we have not made a decision yet on whether to cancel it but were coming up to a point where were going to have to make a decision pretty quickly
1099491 were going to retire bretts number at some point regardless of whether its this year itll be sometime in the future well wait and see but i think its still enough up in the air that we want to wait and see how things play out
1099492 we are all in unison and are very supportive of the way ted and mike have handled this situation
1099493 i asked ted saturday am i welcome in the building if i report and ted was just about shattered he said brett you cant do that youll get me fired i told him im not trying to get anybody fired so ted asked me to let the guys report and lets try to resolve this over the next two or three days
1099494 i said let me compete youll know ill win this job and ted said again brett things have changed aaron rodgers is our quarterback its pretty clear and this is what i told the commissioner that they want me to go away stay retired they would much rather see me in a packers uniform paying me 12 million to be a backup which you know they really dont want rather than see in another uniform no matter what they say theyll drag this out asking a kings ransom in a trade hoping it all goes away
1099495 in my mind its no different than me talking to donovan mcnabb as hes reporting to training camp or talking to brian westbrook i communicate with people in this league you dont leave past relationships
1099496 i have never denied talking to childress ive known childress for about 12 years going back to when he and jay norvell were assistants at wisconsin and they used to come in and sit in our quarterback meetings and then brad went to philadelphia to be with andy reid and you know andy and i are big buddies so the relations continued like i told milt and like i told the commissioner ive spoken to childress ive spoken to darrell bevell vikings offensive coordinator ive spoken to andy reid ive spoken to mike sherman matt millen steve mariucci ive spoken to a lot of guys who are my friends and guys who have coached me either talked to them or left messages
1099497 thats just bogus i dont have a packers cell phone never have i told ted on thursday that he and mccarthy needed to clear up this cell phone thing i told him they needed to get in front of the media and admit that i dont have one of their cell phones and ted said well i think somebody already squashed that story but that isnt enough they need to get up and admit its ridiculous and bogus
1099498 its obviously the first step in brett coming back but well deal with that when brett is reinstated and have a plan for that when he comes back
1099499 rodgers will be starting all of the preseason games as the starter weve talked about possibly playing our first group maybe a little longer and those are things that well discuss the health of your football team obviously factors into that so that is our plan going into the preseason with aaron
1099500 the plan for brett favre will be discussed first with brett favre and then well make the public aware of it
1099501 im not as affected as you guys think i am or should be they told me im the starter and until that changes thats going to be my focus i keep saying that
1099502 any time you have a situation where there is a distraction or one guy getting all the attention or the buzz rather than on us concentrating or executing plays you get tired of answering questions its only going to be worse if he shows up in camp tomorrow or the next day weve just all got to be prepared to be professionals and to practice hard and work hard and make sure everyone on the team is doing their job
1099503 he would love to go back in green bay i mean thats why he started working out but right now it looks like hell be the quarterback at oak grove high school
1099504 im late for a 9 oclock meeting and im not lying
1099505 its to the point where i think its better for myself and better for the football team its time for me to coach the football team i cant concern myself with the day to day blow by blow things that go on outside of the preparation of the team so if he comes in here hell be one of 80 and i will coach him accordingly
1099506 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
1099507 brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers this is really something thats been out there all along
1099508 once hes reinstated bretts going in and once that happens packerland becomes disneyland although thats not what brett wants for his teammates he wants them to be successful and do well but thats what happens if this thing doesnt get resolved and he decides to report
1099509 my intentions have been to play and with green bay they say no so i still want to play in this division for obvious reasons which i made clear to management if they wont let me play in green bay let me play against you thats where i am
1099510 its painfully clear the packers do not want brett back but they will take him back once they have no choice
1099511 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now
1099512 im not trying to interject myself i was interjected into it because there was a tampering charge initially im not looking for things to interject myself to its an issue that needs to be addressed because of the competing interests you want to make sure its done properly and within our rules this is an issue that ultimately has to be decided between brett and the packers
1099513 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
1099514 im a competitor im going to compete this isnt going to be easy its going to be a dogfight and i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
1099515 yeah i take it personally but like i said its not the first time and it wont be the last time
1099516 im happy im excited its good to have him back in the house
1099517 right now i dont want a deal you may think im funny or saying that just to say it but for me im tired of it i washed my hands of the whole situation
1099518 its not even about larrys deal larry earned everything he got honestly he played his butt off he deserved it
1099519 i think my numbers speak for themselves even they the cardinals came out publicly and said that i outplayed my contract i dont have to make a case to anybody why im deserving of a contract thats self explanatory
1099520 when that happens on the field usually guys have helmets on but this happened on the sidelines so it probably wasnt a good idea
1099521 steve was probably a little remorseful for what happened he was trying to apologize so i was walking with him just to be there
1099522 when i was 22 i was a different guy so im not trying to spin anything you spend two hours with somebody and now you know them thats not the case
1099523 im not going to get into whos right whos wrong im completely wrong it was an asinine decision and ill move forward better than i probably have ever had to its the first time in my life that i really havent forgiven myself
1099524 were still waiting on the doctors to give us the timetable on when were going to have this procedure done
1099525 i will not put myself into a position where i have to defend myself to state my side of the story theres no side theres only one side a lack of judgment on my part thats really all i have to say i have no excuse all i have is the opportunity to gain the respect of my fans to gain the respect of my family gain the respect of my co workers and gain the respect of the organization
1099526 im a fallen man im a man that made a mistake i plan to mend the bridges that ive burned and help rebuild the bridge if i need to all by myself
1099527 i cant go out and play this year making 445 000 come on man
1099528 i have to make a statement i showed by going to organized team activities that i was a team player but then i just felt like they werent taking it seriously that i wanted to get a new deal
1099529 theyre very hard deals to get done its a lot of projection and you can only go on current data
1099530 they pay and take care of their own guys and thats a comfortable feeling if youre a player if you play and perform the way they expect the organization will take care of you thats a place you want to be
1099531 its just for yall that im shedding the nickname all my teammates call me pac man yall are not my teammates yall are not in the locker room and going through the trenches with me
1099532 dont call me pac man unless you are a teammate
1099533 im not even worrying about that it will come all ive got to do is do my part and im doing it
1099534 people take it in a different context when i say i want out and im not happy they think he doesnt want to be in cincinnati anymore hes dissing us as fans its not like that i love my fans i wasnt able to get that point across theyve supported me theyve been good to me and ive been good to them i was going through a situation where i felt a change was needed it didnt work out hey im back get ready for the show
1099535 im still in cincinnati this is one of those crazy things i love cincinnati i love my fans i love everything about it i wasnt happy about certain things the business side of it and i spoke my mind and that was it
1099536 a true fan of mine knows what theyve got a true fan of mine sticks with me through thick and thin when things arent going right thats what a true fan does those that are upset because i spoke my mind theres not much i can do but apologize
1099537 wide receivers have always been flamboyant theyve always been flashy its just something you have to have when youre playing receiver you have to have a certain stigma about you all of us all have different characteristics and personalities but were all rock stars
1099538 i think left tackle matt light and i popped a cold beer when i saw that transaction we were the two most excited players in the nfl we were hugging each other it was awesome
1099539 when those lightning bolts start coming out of the sky and the wind blowing theres a god that i believe in thats bigger than me that has a whistle hes telling me you know what we aint going so you dont go you just line up tomorrow and go
1099540 we claimed that between five and ten thousand women a year died of botched abortions
1099541 the actual figure was closer to 200 to 300 and we also claimed that there were a million illegal abortions a year in the united states and the actual figure was close to 200 000 so we were guilty of massive deception
1099542 i mean as a founding member and chairman of the medical committee i accepted the figures which came from a biostatistician named christopher tietze and he and his wife passed along these figures to us at naral we were in no position to validate them or not so we accepted them in the interests of higher standards or at least higher objectives
1099543 the gao sustained eight of the slightly more than 100 issues protested with this contract we will address all of these in the new solicitation and we will request revised proposals from industry
1099544 we will not expedite steps in the process we have to do this methodically fairly and without bias in any way
1099545 the question is are they willing to concede that we may get to a different outcome and then accept that outcome
1099546 what we want to make sure is that the rebid is not just a redo with a rubber stamp approved on it we want to make sure that we dont have another misstep
1099547 it may be a slow process but with gods hand everything is possible god is able to throw a mountain into the sea let us not be negative when commenting on president mwanawasas illness the president is a national asset and you the people elected him
1099548 we hope that soon the border opening hours will be prolonged probably to 24 hours a day
1099549 there are no guarantees what is happening now is just out of the goodwill of the government
1099550 if today the government decides to withdraw the arv programme you cannot contest the decision because you have no right to health and if this cost sharing programme in schools is withdrawn there is also nothing anyone can do because there is no right to education
1099551 they do not know anything most people think that they have a right to those things while in actual fact they do not have you cannot say your right to health or education has been violated

1099553 it tends to be adopted as a quick fix but unsustainable solution to the cessation of hostilities it has set a dangerous precedent for the development of democracy on our continent we join with other civil society organisations in zimbabwe and in the region to advocate for the need for a transformational authority with a fixed time frame and clear mandate
1099554 without the voices of the people articulated through the civil society there is a real risk that the issues faced by the ordinary zimbabweans in their daily struggles will not form the basis of the talks these include the real effects of the ongoing humanitarian crisis and the economic meltdown
1099555 we are aware of the economic situation we do not wish the zimbabweans were in that situation we believe the zimbabweans can peacefully resolve the situation if they come to the table as equal partners we are committed to seeing zimbabwe retain its status as the bread basket of the region
1099556 in the last 20 years i believe that african american quarterbacks have received the opportunity needed to succeed at all levels in football no longer do you see the quick conversions to other positions that were so prevalent from the 40s to the 80s
1099557 look at warren moon he was a record setting quarterback but he wasnt even drafted at a time when the draft had 12 rounds a few years ago the jaguars drafted matt jones a white quarterback and converted him to wide receiver while all three of their quarterbacks are african americans
1099558 ive talked to some young players and they tell me hey i am just a quarterback i am not treated any different from anybody else
1099559 towns splitting over black vs white quarterbacks comments on the bottom of piles on the field ugly words in the stands i had someone tell me a story that they heard a coach tell a high school player that he didnt look like a quarterback to him and the kid was moved to wide receiver
1099560 heres ohio state known for those craig krenzel type quarterbacks all i formations handoffs and play action now they are recruiting guys like pryor as quarterbacks the number of opportunities keep growing
1099561 acknowledge the legendary celebrate the current and promote future professional quarterbacks through a schedule of comprehensive leadership training personal development and skills exhibitions
1099562 it is wonderful that chris leak and troy smith can face each other for the national championship and they are both quarterbacks first but there is a journey and a matriculation of the black quarterback that must be told the great thing is many young black quarterbacks have taken an interest in greats like doug williams but there can never be enough education
1099563 there are still some fans on message boards and media figures like rush limbaugh whose bias shines through
1099564 kids have it tough because they may not understand where possible bias is coming from a lot of times kids idealize sports and life so it is deflating when politics come into play
1099565 hopefully there will be a day where a quarterback is a quarterback
1099566 a few years ago the jaguars drafted matt jones a white quarterback and converted him to wide receiver while all three of their quarterbacks are african americans
1099567 cscs cscs cscs cscs cscs cscs cscs cscs same code travis henry edition
1099568 no because they have to report to the official to be eligible
1099569 no because in the nfl only the ends can go downfield from a scrimmage kick formation and the instant someone lines up as an interior lineman theyre ineligible period game over
1099570 donovans not as good as the media thinks he is and the reason i think the media thinks this is because they want a black quarterback to succeed
1099571 a 11 is illegal in the nfl and in college and as pointed out last fall on the a 11 site most high school rules as well its just that the local cif or whatever the organizing body is screwed up the rules in these coaches conference
1099572 i dont think hes been that good from the get go
1099573 if limbaugh had been an astute analyst what he wouldve said is donovan mcnabb has never been more than a mediocre quarterback other than that limbaugh pretty much spoke the truth saying in public what many football fans have been saying privately for the last couple of seasons
1099574 overrated what we have here is a little social concern in the nfl the media has been very desirous that a black quarterback can do well black quarterbacks and black coaches doing well theres a little hope invested in mcnabb and he got a lot of credit for the performance of the team that he didnt deserve the defense carried this team
1099575 limbaugh is being excoriated for making race an issue in the nfl this is blatant hypocrisy i dont know of a football writer who didnt regard the dearth of black quarterbacks in the nfl as one of the important issues of the late eighties and early nineties
1099576 rush limbaugh didnt say mcnabb was a bad quarterback because hes black he said that the media has overrated mcnabb because he is black and limabugh is right he didnt say anything he shouldnt have said and in fact said things that other commentators should have been saying for some time now i admit i should have said it myself
1099577 vick overthrows his receivers and theyre talking about arm strength
1099578 oh hes just having fun out there look at him laugh
1099579 to pretend that many of us didnt want mcnabb to be the best quarterback in the nfl because hes black is absurd
1099580 mcnabb not as good as hes cracked up to be
1099581 it kinda slipped out of my hand and got away from me
1099582 it was a matter of either me taking it into the end zone or mike im not sure they said from upstairs that i might have made it myself i didnt think i could
1099583 well ive got 5 tds running the option this year
1099584 and our backs have scored more were going to do the things that got us here we cant throw it out now
1099585 out of curiousity i looked at fos qb ratings for 2000 2002 to see if mcnabb was overrated or not 2000 15th best qb 2001 20th best qb 2002 24th best qb those dont look like pro bowl rankings to me id say that the numbers suggest he was very overrated
1099586 if there are genetic differences that account for there being no significant white cbs or rbs how is it unreasonable to think it might go both ways
1099587 pat has a metric crapton of work piling up and gets to sleep at 2 am for the past four days
1099588 49 yeah i mentioned that earlier we all saw what happened when trent green tried to block for the running game last year and i remember about 3 years ago when mark brunell threw a block and messed up his throwing arm too dicey
1099589 if you were playing that sort of offence you wouldnt be using a traditional qb youd be using qb rb slash hybrids rbs have no problem blocking d lineman so i dont see any reason a hybrid of the right size couldnt
1099590 the system requires a player with the physical tools to be an average qb rb fb te hybrid teams have a hard enough time finding players who can fulfill one of those roles let alone two
1099591 if all goes well the defensive end on the side the play is being run will be practically in mannings face once james or say dominic rhodes is taking off with the ball

1099600 youve made a lot of friends throughout your life and youll be making a lot more you can be very proud of this but you can safely multiply that number by 7 to reveal the minimum number of secret admirers whove loved you from afar by 100 to approximate the minimum number of people youve inspired and by 10 000 to uncover the least number of lives yours has improved and this im very proud of
1099601 il perdersi a poco a poco di una cosa per fusione o putrefazione
1099602 kami sempat kecewa karena pertama kali mendengar informasi mengenai hal ini justru dari pihak di luar unwim padahal konfirmasi masalah sebesar ini sebenarnya ingin kami dengar langsung dari rektorat masalah ini kan melibatkan nasib seluruh elemen kampus termasuk mahasiswa dan dosen
1099603 setelah beberapa kali dimintai keterangan rektor pun akhirnya memperlihatkan sesatu lembar salinan mou antara itb dan pemprov jabar kepada bem
1099604 saya lebih menginginkan bentuk kerja sama antara unwim dan itb dalam kerja sama tidak ada pihak yang melemahkan kelembagaan pihak lain namun jika rencananya peleburan berarti unwim dilemahkan secara kelembagaan
1099605 ujar yusuf iman usai resmi mengucap dua kalimah syahadat kini yusuf iman mengisi hari demi hari dengan mendalami islam bersama seorang ustadz yang ditunjuk untuk membinanya

1099607 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
1099608 its very hard to take yourself too seriously when you look at the world from outer space
1099609 langkah terbaik yang bisa diambil pemprov adalah dengan mengintegrasikan unwim ke dalam itb multikampus
1099610 dengan produktivitas yang minim pemprov tidak mungkin lagi memberdayakan unwim secara langsung
1099611 surat keputusannya sudah ada dan kami tinggal mencari waktu untuk berdiskusi dengan seluruh civitas academica unwim termasuk mahasiswa dan dosen
1099612 nanti ada seleksi lagi bagi mahasiswa unwim dan yang memenuhi standar statusnya akan menjadi mahasiswa itb sementara bagi yang tidak lolos seleksi masih berstatus sebagai mahasiswa unwim
1099613 standar dosen itb kan s 3 jadi kalau ingin jadi dosen itb syaratnya harus s 3 dulu
1099614 ini baru penawaran dari itb jika dirasa kurang sinergis masih bisa dibicarakan lagi
1099615 kita tunggu sampai mereka semua lulus dan unwim benar benar siap
1099616 ijazah mereka tetap berlaku dan legalisasinya tetap sah meski status kampus mereka sudah berubah

1099626 our recommendations recognize the large number of scientific studies that demonstrate greater accuracy in identifying women at risk of having or developing cervical cancer when a pap is combined with the hpv test rather than relying on a pap smear alone
1099627 by using both tests for women 30 and over when cervical cancer is most common we hope to greatly reduce the number of women suffering and dying from this disease
1099628 unlike other cancers cervical cancer is virtually 100 percent preventable if women and their healthcare providers have access to the hpv test and other new advances in preventive care

1099811 a proper jewish leadership would act with full force to deter terrorists their dispatchers and their supporters as well as to expel enemies and take all measures to end the bloodshed in the holy land

1099955 congressman dick sukkur d chose to lay on the beach at cancun while you suffered at the pump
1099956 dont look back once you had decided just keep on moving forward
1099957 why dont you come inside out of the sun you must be hot we can talk a bit before i show you
1099958 i understand you used to work with the government eh
1099959 i guess that makes you a bit of a lobster
1099960 you know red on the outside white on the inside
1099961 we saw the first ones in spring a few days after equinox they were biting the children so we beat the bushes until we captured one
1099962 ill be honest with you detective when my daughter arranged this i was sceptical i was sure you wouldnt be the right man for the job
1099963 but im starting to think i was wrong it takes a true native to understand
1099964 perhaps i was too quick to accuse you of being a lobster were you raised on reserve
1099965 i have a rare condition that causes me to remain fully aware throughout the sleep cycle monsieur corbeau you may have noticed the bags beneath my eyes it is not a restful way to live never the less it means i am in near constant communion with dream which provides me certain advantages indeed i have not forgotten the old ways the old ways wont let me go
1099966 to live in dream to fly at will to speak with the spirits i am amazed and i envy you
1099967 you would not sir if you knew the whole of it you are thinking of the shallow dreams of the visions grasped by your waking mind you a healthy man have never experienced the dark space of the deep dreaming for that you should be grateful
1099968 um of course as i said we captured one and brought it into the barn that was a mistake
1099969 an army of moos bas rose up at sunset enraged mink spirits exploding from the soil like in the stories my grandmother used to tell us around the fire vicious things they are the moos bas terrifying eh
1099970 they stormed the barn and freed the awa hon do three of my farmhands were bitten
1099971 no by the moos bas mink bites sharp and deep
1099972 but the wounds werent nearly half of it eh over the next couple of days each of them developed this urge to leave the farm my cousins their whole lives lived here on jesus island hellbent on dropping everything to go
1099973 north they awoke with the word on their lips wiyasakami do you know it
1099974 they couldnt explain it all they knew was that they had to leave right and no matter what we said they went they went north two at sunset then the third the next dawn we havent heard from them since
1099975 the children bitten by the awa hon do did not suffer the same compulsion
1099976 they see glooscap he who is made of words they attack him thrashing his body with birch but he breathes flames and repels them they wake up clawing at their skin as it was on fire still some of them have scratched themselves up something awful to stop the burning
1099977 they all dream the same dream even before they told anyone about what they saw have you ever heard of anything like that before detective
1099978 you mentioned that you had something to show me sir is it a caged specimen
1099979 we followed the holes from where the moos bas erupted outside the barn they converge underground they come together feeding into a network i guess youd call it
1099980 on account of only a fraction of it being visible right its a tree that grows underground far underground
1099981 its the damnedest thing ive ever laid eyes on if anyone else had told me about it id say they were nuts
1099982 but i like to keep it clear so the machines can get through youre okay to go in on foot eh
1099983 earth movers we started off trying to dig the sucker out you understand to get rid of it but now were just digging to see how far the damn thing goes
1099984 and weve learned to become close through it we didnt used to get on right
1099985 gerards a genuine lobster detective and hes not ashamed of it he went to white mans school in halifax doesnt even speak a word of abenaki hed be more likely to tell you something about jerry seinfeld than tabaldak or glooscap
1099986 the value in that is that hes not so intimidated by the spirits eh his ignorance makes him brave
1099987 its no big deal to be brave in the face of folklore and bullcrap
1099988 if you ask me somebodys trying to run us off the land to spook us eh its like in scooby doo and i wouldve gotten away with it too if it werent for you meddling indians you know
1099989 listen were going to dig this thing out figure out what it is and then sue whoevers responsible thats all there is to it guy
1099990 is there reason to think someone may want you out
1099991 well there is and there isnt detective i suspect theres some mohawks that wouldnt mind seeing the farm in six nations hands but its not something we get trouble over my family won this land in a card game back in seventeen ninety three weve been working it ever since now are there companies that wouldnt mind taking over sure there are green giant tries to squeeze us they come by with offers from time to time okay but they know they dont have a hope unless we want it the fact is we turn a healthy profit here nobodys about to foreclose on us or force us into anything were not desperate
1099992 when we got below ten meters we started hearing things
1099993 there isnt a tree on earth thats supposed to grow this way is there detective
1099994 frankly i was hoping you might be able to give us some answers
1099995 i do not believe there exists a living expert in this no one can solve the puzzle for us monsieur corbeau if we want answers well have to get them ourselves
1099996 youre a true brave arent you you walk with the warriors
1099997 and its just black inside and just quiet eh but you can hear the wind
1099998 youre not thinking of doing this all by your lonesome are you guy
1099999 you should have had a spirit walk to prepare you for this kind of journey you may get lost without one and there are many ways to get lost
