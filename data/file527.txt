5270026 its only pajamas anyway its not that big a deal
5270027 i understand that its our job to take on the missions no one else wants to
5270028 bukowski had a story that essentially was saying that its the little things that drive men mad
5270029 its not world war ii its the broken shoe lace when there is no time left that sends men completely out of their minds
5270030 i think there is a little bit of frank in everybody
5270031 its not world war ii its the broken shoe lace when there is no time left that sends men completely out of their minds
5270032 they had their patron saint of their province and they honored him over there in italy and they brought the tradition over here it has a long history
5270033 the key to keeping it going is to get the younger generation to work with the older generation but dont make the older generation feel like they are getting thrown out
5270034 the torch has been passed on from generation to generation
5270035 it is getting old and fragile we have tried to have it mended a couple of times
5270036 it lasted two weeks they blocked off the streets there were amusement rides there were bingo tables in the streets you always had something to do every night for two weeks in august people here really supported it it was a much bigger neighborhood with more families
5270037 provoked the greatest uproar against a papal edict in the long history of the roman catholic church
5270038 held that the twin functions of marriage to foster love between the partners and to be open to children are so closely related as to be inseparable
5270039 a rise in infidelity a lessening of respect for women by men and the coercive use of reproductive technologies by governments
5270040 i do not recognize the right of anyone who hasnt read the document to talk about it
5270041 less than half a century later these preoccupations with overwhelming birth rates appear as pseudo scientific as phrenology
5270042 no country in europe has a fertility rate above 2 1 the number of children each woman needs to have by the end of her child bearing years to keep a population stable even with increasing immigration europe is projected to suffer a population loss in the 21st century that will rival the impact of the black death leading some to talk about the continents demographic suicide
5270043 makes me question my intellegence to keep reading this garbage its like those idiots that read tabloids
5270044 thats not going to change im never going to change my culture yao has played with a lot of black players but i dont think hes ever played with a black player that really represents his culture as much as i represent my culture once yao ming gets to know me hell understand what im about if you go back to the brawl thats a culture issue right there
5270045 somebody was disrespecting me so hes got to understand where im coming from people that know me know that ron artest never changed
5270046 im going to talk about the three things we cant talk about at the office sex politics and religion the reason there are so many jokes about sex is that sex is a joke played on us by god it takes the love and cooperation of the two most different creatures on this planet to beget and raise a child to be a decent adult and if that doesnt show gods sense of humor i dont know what does
5270047 hey mark didnt artest attack someone in the crowd too or was that a different brawl i might have missed one
5270048 it takes the love and cooperation of the two most different creatures on this planet to beget and raise a child to be a decent adult and if that doesnt show gods sense of humor i dont know what does
5270049 raising a kid is a cinch compared to trying to convince your partner that sperm fights plaque
5270050 my sperm was so powerful it busted right through the pills defenses
5270051 the sexual organs are there for procreation thats what they were designed for why use them for any other purpose
5270052 i do know some experts on the subject of sex who have told me that a lot of modern youngsters dont think oral sex is really sex believe it or not
5270053 ive never understood the attraction of oral sex man and women are meant to be together and cooperate in procreation
5270054 as to urine ili in the man yes in the woman no the woman has two channels just efficient engineering
5270055 i have a hard time when people use the catholic church as a moral authority after the priest abuse scandal
5270056 if a mans wife no longer wishes to have sex is the man not allowed to satisfy himself
5270057 if a handicapped persons only sexual outlet does not permit intercourse is that person supposed to remain sexually frustrated
5270058 are gay men and lesbians who generally find the thought of heterosexual sex unappealing if not repugnant supposed to remain celibate why shouldnt they be able to reap the medical benefits of sex or do you advocate that gay men and lesbians marry opposite sex partners
5270059 ili i disagree with your reasoning fr greeley said something like we should thank god for creating such an interesting and rewarding way of keeping the species going sex is fun if it werent who would do it especially if grin here they knew in short while they would have teenagers
5270060 tiny correct me if im wrong i know you will sodomy is illegal in minnesota therefore i believe there are sodomy laws on the books already
5270061 i have a hard time when people use the catholic church as a moral authority after the priest abuse scandal
5270062 the clerical abuse scandal which i admit is a terrible scandal and no one is more furious about it than faithful catholics as best i know came about because of some very stupid and un christian decisions by some bishops to admit to the priesthood men with screwball sex lives and then cover up for them when the priests went wrong
5270063 so if oral sex is bad then what about kissing or touching during sex
5270064 hey you no play a da game you no make a da rules
5270065 oral sex has zero possibility of resulting in procreation thats why its wrong plus from a natural law standpoint its contrary to the design of the human being
5270066 if i believed in god i would point out that god made me a sexual being and that god made me gay that doesnt sound like much of a call to chastity to me
5270067 even if it is limited to foreplay followed by intercourse
5270068 i have to disagree with you oral sex is often used as a method of foreplay to get each partner ready for intercourse from a natural law standpoint everything fits together quite nicely during oral sex
5270069 and what about the 98 99 of priests who have done nothing wrong guilt by association that doesnt seem fair to me
5270070 according to bliss i guess my wife and i have to strip and run at each other making sure we never touch leap into the air and pray to god the units link up in the proper place so the procreation can begin
5270071 plus teachers have also committed sexual crimes i e mary kay letourneau yet teachers are lauded and applauded by society and priests are all suspected as pedophiles
5270072 i am aware that it can be extremely difficult to exercise self control over sexual impulses but it is extremely worth it having a mortal sin on your soul is a very grave matter and you want to avoid that situation
5270073 teachers are lauded and applauded by society and priests are all suspected as pedophiles
5270074 i dont recall ever stating that touching your wife was sinful
5270075 sorry i have a very hard time believing that an almighty all powerful ruler with total control of the universe really cars whether or not some 13 year old boy in grand forks is pleasuring himself at this very moment and has plans to make the kid suffer eternal damnation or make him go blind or even give him a hairy palm
5270076 oral sex between a married couple is sinful because its a form of sexual intercourse that is inherently closed to procreation thats why
5270077 according to bliss i guess my wife and i have to strip and run at each other making sure we never touch leap into the air and pray to god the units link up in the proper place so the procreation can begin
5270078 i just dont like them telling us how to physically love one another
5270079 parents supposedly love their children even though they punish their children for disobeying them
5270080 youve got to explain to me how touching my wife with my hands
5270081 i knew by age five that i found other males attractive in a sexual way
5270082 yet people trust doctors to tell them how to take care of themselves
5270083 its not surprising because this is how the catholic church and the vatican dealt with the situation also
5270084 so you see sex between a post menopausal woman and a man within the confines of holy matrimony is not closed to the possibility however remote of procreation
5270085 i was simply pointing out that the problem was not as widespread as some people may think it was
5270086 and what about the local bishop who fails to report the abuse to the police and transfers the abusers to other parishes i
5270087 the media coverage regarding the clergy abuse scandal was extremely biased against the church i was simply pointing out that the problem was not as widespread as some people may think it was
5270088 contraception is using artificial rather than natural methods to regulate births and thus profanes the sexual act because it deliberately and inherently negates the procreative act whereas natural family planning does not
5270089 responsible parenthood is exercised either by the deliberate and generous decision to raise a numerous family or by the decision made for grave motives and with due respect for the moral law to avoid for the time being or even for an indeterminate period a new birth
5270090 first cardinal law was forced to resign so he was
5270091 to the abuse victim it doesnt matter if it was 1 priest or a billion priests
5270092 but priesthood wise its a statistically small number of priests the media coverage makes it seem as if every priest is suspect
5270093 in the case of kerry the problem the church had with him was simply that he was well known to be a public dissenter from church teaching as such and since he claimed to be a catholic it was right to ask that he be refused communion
5270094 however we have to choose words carefully there is a certain fundamental moral law common to almost all people at all times and in all places dont murder dont steal dont lie give fair play that has always been a part of english common law and american law derived from it
5270095 tb77 youre quite right that sex is a natural instinct however following it is not necessary for personal survival also catholic belief is that though marriage and family are great gifts celibacy is greater if one can do it its not for everyone and even those who are called to it have to rememeber that what theyre freely giving up is a good thing
5270096 now i dont think there should be an established church in the united states but i see no problem with writing catholic social teachings into secular law i dont the constitution requires complete separation of church and state i just think it forbids the establishment of a national church and requires freedom of religion
5270097 the thing that worries me is that our culture is so secular and so hostile to people living their faith in their everyday life that a lot of people called to the priesthood and religious life are either too afraid to follow the call or cant hear the voice of the lord because they dont know how to listen for it thats a very sad thing indeed
5270098 just me but people feel a bit uneasy having a belief system forced upon them
5270099 if theres no higher power that we are accountable to then who needs laws lifes a party no right no wrong no nothing ive never understood atheists who think we can have moral absolutes without god
5270100 consider this the core doctrines of both the lutheran church missouri synod and the wisconsin evangelical lutheran synod state that the papacy is the antichrist check their web sites if you dont believe me how would you feel if that was written into our secular laws
5270101 all laws legislate morality and people shouldnt be forced to compartmentalize their religion they should be able to live it everyday and it should be a part of everything they do i thought our society was tolerant enough to understand that for some people their religion is so important to them that they incorporate it into everything they do each day i guess i was mistaken
5270102 i think incorporating dogma into laws is a bad idea but not religious social teachings
5270103 im not so sure secular humanism is forced down anyones throat unless they want it to be
5270104 what matters to me is living a life on this earth in peace with the world and with others and in doing what i can to leave the world a better place after im gone
5270105 as an atheist i find this offensive if this is what you believe then you must believe that all atheists are immoral or amoral i believe i am a moral person and i dont need a supernatural being to be one
5270106 i believe i am a moral person and i dont need a supernatural being to be one
5270107 i advocate that everyone be free to make decisions for themselves in accordance with their own belief systems within reason i dont advocate a right to murder for someone who thinks human sacrifice is in accordance with his her belief system i advocate your right to practice the religion of your choice and to live your life and make your decisions based on your religious belief system why would you deny me that same right because you disapprove of my decisions i dont necessarily approve of your decisions but i advocate your right to make them
5270108 for one who aspires to the priesthood you have a shockingly poor understanding of the difference between secular and sectarian law
5270109 if a pharmacist cannot meet that expectation then he she should find a new career
5270110 im one of the lucky ones some people cant afford to go to religious colleges even with scholarships
5270111 nor some people go to parochial elementary or high schools because of location and money
5270112 there are far more people who are willing to die for something they believe in than you may think
5270113 thanks for mentioning soldiers i forgot about the military youre right there are similarities although my battle is a spiritual one not a physical one
5270114 give to caesar what is caesars and to god what is gods
5270115 thanks for mentioning soldiers i forgot about the military youre right there are similarities although my battle is a spiritual one not a physical one
5270116 so the christian sometimes has to do a delicate balancing act between duty to god and duty to country sometimes the two are in harmony sometimes they conflict in blissmeisters eyes and mine this era in american history is one of the times they conflict and a christian has to make some very hard choices
5270117 and bliss not that it needs to be pointed out but those soldiers are fighting for your right to be the person you want to be
5270118 do unto others as you wish them to do unto you
5270119 what is hateful to you do not do to your neighbor
5270120 if the commies conquered america and told you to renounce christ or die what would you do
5270121 because you cant organize a resistance if youre dead sister
5270122 both sides believe their war is just and god is on their side
5270123 thats one of the reasons i dislike party politics theres too much wrangling and not enough search for common ground as i see it
5270124 whats the deal with taking on an alias when becoming pope
5270125 its not an alias its a regnal name i think it comes from the tradition of jesus changing simons name to peter when he chose him to lead the church in the gospel of matthew
5270126 thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church
5270127 ili clever even if a smidge irreverent when you say fredo do you mean frito or frodo or someone else
5270128 i know it was you fredo you broke my heart you broke my heart
5270129 if a massive correction in human population do to cataclysmic events gets us back down to under a billion and my wife and i are still left standing ill try to convince her to flush the pills and well start making babies
5270130 and my wife and i are still left standing ill try to convince her to flush the pills and well start making babies
5270131 about as offensive as flushing the koran down the toilet
5270132 thus he went forth throughout the homes with wheels and gathered thee friends gold for the holy quest for brew thou he returned with plenty of fox deluxe many drank but no one buzzed
5270133 i think publishing the cartoons of allah was a bad idea even if they didnt know that publishing images of allah is reprehensible for muslims the muslims deserve an apology
5270134 even if they didnt know that publishing images of allah is reprehensible for muslims the muslims deserve an apology
5270135 i was curious as to what non catholics think of myers actions
5270136 i cant stand it any more i like ike its
5270137 yep and i always take the word of a inmate who was or is incarcerated in prison i just cant see why they would have a motive to lie
5270138 would you take the words of the officers who say it and reprimanded them
5270139 i didnt realize this was your blog well im soorry aw i dont spell it that way i spell it with oo
5270140 actually dr myers asked his blog readers to steal the eucharist from a catholic mass and then send it to him via mail
5270141 steal it or did they walk through the line they got it and then gave it to the doc
5270142 these cartoons are not comparable to what myers did no one stole or desecrated anything drawing and publishing such cartoons is legal in denmark
5270143 the fact that muslims found the cartoons an abomination is irrelevant because the real issue isnt one of muslims being offended the real issue is the right to exercise freedom of speech and thought
5270144 should the publications of these cartoons have been allowed i answer yes because freedom of expression is a principle of western society but the right not to be offended does not exist this latter leads me to note that there is another right we are free to exercise the right to ignore things we find offensive
5270145 i disapprove of what you say but i will defend to the death your right to say it
5270146 they are not identical because as has been repeatedly pointed out myers committed a crime theft to make his point
5270147 but its well known mark that you like to try picking fights with me so im not at all surprised that youre trying it again here
5270148 as it pertains to the affront to religion the theft is irrelevant and the offense to the muslims and catholics is all that matters here in that case they are identical
5270149 that im of the opinion is not related to the religion but rather the culture they live in for example i didnt see muslims in the mpls rioting in the streets
5270150 although didnt the muslim religous leaders condemn the editors to death
5270151 hes a heavy drinker and sometimes when he drinks he changes and gets real nasty
5270152 he was crouched down ready to pounce on me and he was scaring me he jumped up and grabbed me by my face and grabbed my nose and bit it off
5270153 i dont know if he swallowed it or if my dogs might have eaten it i dont know
5270154 id be shocked to hear of local mn muslims who grew up here wanting anyone dead over a cartoon
5270155 terrified passengers on a greyhound canada bus travelling on the trans canada highway stood by helpless thursday as a man repeatedly stabbed and then beheaded a young fellow passenger
5270156 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
5270157 i can do that its my lawn mower and my yard so i can shoot it if i want
5270158 did the muslims in denmark emigrate their or were they born there id bet most of the adults rioting grew up somewhere else
5270159 as for taunting me i support your right to choose to act like an ass
5270160 i have nothing to say other than i wasnt thinking of ass in a sexual way
5270161 ive watched wrestling and my husband has been kind enough to help me with my moves
5270162 im completely okay with being lets say less than above board on fighting techniques
5270163 we will double team them i will place them in an immobilizing hold one at a time and then you can work them over
5270164 show no mercy they have what is coming to them
5270165 if your mother had a baby and the baby looked like you
5270166 i am not trying to be disrespectful but does anyone else have the problem of having to suppress laughter at funerals
5270167 i would really want people to laugh and have fun at my funeral
5270168 kids are such geeks these days dangerous but geeks all the same skin fighting aka fists
5270169 i would really want people to laugh and have fun at my funeral
5270170 lets act people do the right thing try to help
5270171 something which has never occurred since time immemorial a young woman did not fart in her husbands lap
5270172 as far as aisha is concerned you insinuated she was an unchaste woman
5270173 god is a producer psychologists with a sense of humor he has a cast of billions no script is ever written when you have a cast of billions who has the time to write scripts today is happening tomorrow is yet to be we are his reality show
5270174 although ive said it before this next part bears repeating
5270175 with fewer than 48 hours to go throughout most of the world only a small percentage of the 87 countries that voted last summer on
5270176 but so far knol looks to me like the biggest risk might be to google itself thats because it provides one more way for spammers to
5270177 well i dont know if its concentration or apprehension i dont know what it is
5270178 i felt hibs were vulnerable i felt if we could get right at them we could have got an early goal it all was said in the dressing room
5270179 but there is a small thing as a coach i have been working very hard on the training ground and pitch maybe im giving them too much maybe they dont have the mental intelligence to take it in and then go and express themselves on the pitch
5270180 maybe i should just let them go and express themselves set it up and be hard to beat and let them go and play
5270181 im only going to bring quality in we havent got the money to go out and buy six 15m players
5270182 we dont have that so of course we are going to bring players in who are down at the lower end of the market but as ive always said im looking to get the main quality players in first then we will look at what we do after that
5270183 the only people who can give things a lift at the minute are the players who are here
5270184 the fans have been terrific and tried to stay behind the team we have just got to get on with things because nobody is going to feel sorry for us
5270185 blackburn they didnt feel sorry for us did they all we can do now is maximise everything that we have got here get the best from every single player
5270186 i was delighted with the attitude and the character we showed for the spurs game and i want to have a look at a couple of games before making a final decision
5270187 im pleased to have added justin hoyte to the squad but we have no more bids in at the moment and it may stay that way
5270188 it may leave us a little bit short but then we have players who have proved they can play in a number of positions villa only had a small squad last season and they finished above us in the table

5270194 you have these cars but with actual fleshy eyes with irises and mouths of teeth and tongues where does the machine end and the flesh begin so to make everything piece together a little better in my head i drew up what i think the internal structures of lightning mcqueen might look like
5270195 cars is the pixar only movie theyve done where theyve extricated the experience from our world and put it somewhere else completely and that leads me to the one thing that didnt sit well with me the strange machine flesh hybrids pixar came up with to populate this world its as if a mad scientist enamored with automobiles terraformed mars and furnished it with cyborg vehicles with engines of steel and minds of flesh
5270196 what weve tried to do is address concerns by various parties where we can
5270197 its true that the majority of complaints come from homes within a quarter mile of wells
5270198 we are at the point of really fine tuning the language
5270199 we are in a situation where the oil and gas industry is always moving the goal posts
5270200 the proposed rules arent perfect but theyre pretty good if we could all agree on them
5270201 what technology has made the biggest change in your life
5270202 i dont remember much but the girl in front of me crashing and then looking and seeing bikes everywhere i stood up and immediately started to cry i couldnt move my elbow
5270203 there is nothing worse than not finishing i wouldnt have cared if i finished last with a broken arm but i needed another arm to climb those hills today
5270204 im going to stick around for the rest of the olympics and cheer the guys on tomorrow
5270205 i will be at the closing ceremonies i may just have my arm hung up
5270206 i was prepared for the heat in the run and bike but not the water which was really warm and that told the day for me
5270207 it was tough but this is the olympics and it is supposed to be tough
5270208 i think thats why the feeling of accomplishment must be so much greater for those who are on the podium today
5270209 there were a couple of times when they told us to just shut up
5270210 my sisters and brothers wont even talk to me anymore
5270211 i enjoyed the opportunity to meet senator obama and discuss an issue that is americas top priority which is ending our dependence on foreign oil that today is approaching 70 percent of our imports and is costing us 700 billion a year
5270212 i assured senator obama that this is a non partisan campaign and that i will do everything in my power to work together with leaders who are willing to solve our immense energy problems which are ruining our economy and threatening our national security
5270213 as i did with senator mccain on friday i stressed the urgency of the situation and the need to end the largest transfer of wealth in human history
5270214 we discussed my plan and the opportunities to create jobs grow our economy and revitalize americas heartland by using private capital to invest in renewable energy including wind and solar power that are among our most abundant and untapped natural resources
5270215 i have never seen such a big rally in srinagar
5270216 i couldnt resist coming out to demand freedom from india
5270217 his next stage in life was a reflection of the true nature and cruelty of zionism the state of
5270218 im in a relationship but i like my own things and i dont have to be with my significant other 100 of the time
5270219 im absolutely delighted with the quality of the additional staff we have appointed to the national management team
5270220 to secure the services of the ex all blacks captain mike brewer is a boost he is now a very experienced coach having worked in club rugby in ireland england and italy before becoming forwards coach for leinster
5270221 anyone who knows rugby will have been impressed by the progress leinster the reigning magners league champions have made up front during his three years in that role
5270222 graham is among the most experienced defence coaches in the world having now spent five years in that position in rugby union with firstly munster and then ireland
5270223 im looking forward to working with frank and the other coaches
5270224 scotland have a young team with a great work ethic and players who are very keen to learn i think they have the potential to develop into a really good international side in the next three to four years
5270225 i have been an admirer of scotland and the work that alan tait has undertaken in the last few seasons
5270226 i look forward to being part of franks coaching team and to getting the players trust and buy in to the defensive systems ill look to put in place the experience ive gleaned from involvement in both union and league will hold me in good stead
5270227 celtic got the breakthrough nakamura shunsuke does great for the goal hartley keeps his shot down and they go ahead
5270228 and then were sitting here thinking you do expect the response from dundee united because theyre pushing for the game and they have nothing to lose now they are trying to get a result
5270229 and you expect celtic to go on and win by two or three
5270230 five minutes after the goal big jan vennegoor of hesselink gets a great chance and really should have scored from 12 yards out he hits the target keeps it low but for me he really shouldve scored
5270231 sandaza looks a real threat he looks a good player and he made a difference today
5270232 we sat here watching the game and after 73 minutes we could sense that dundee united were going to get something because there was more purpose about their attack
5270233 when sandaza came on there was more belief and supply from conway craig and from grainger danny on the left hand side
5270234 we tried our best to get a system which suited thomas and it hasnt worked
5270235 it was the system to blame not the player or the club
5270236 celtic thomas gravesen and thomass representatives have agreed that he will part company with the club
5270237 oh no im only the third best wrestler in the world

5270262 weve been practising a lot on finishing in training during the week and it was pretty similar to that game and i knew what i was doing and luckily enough it went in today
5270263 it was a very very hard game to play in and i was absolutely knackered towards the end and im sure everyone was
5270264 falkirk kept putting us under pressure and all credit to them but i think we deserved to win and i think we could have scored more goals
5270265 i thought alan obrien was absolutely brilliant today but to be fair he has been looking brilliant in pre season as well and i think the hibs fans will see the best of alan obrien this season now that hes got his confidence back that he maybe needed

5270268 this essential treaty has languished in limbo for more than a decade largely due to the failure of nations in not signing up to what they long ago agreed to
5270269 because most of the worlds transboundary river basins lack adequate legal protection the world needs a global framework for sustainably managing and preventing disputes over those resources and this is the only such framework available in the timescale to help us deal with a growing water crisis
5270270 now when there are increasing water shortages and water quality issues world wide and climate change will only make things worse is when we need to have an effective and widely accepted agreement of global scope covering shared freshwater resources
5270271 this is about national and global security as much as human and water security
5270272 the experts are telling us that rivalries over water will be a significant source of future conflict as indeed they already are
5270273 an essential element of the response to our current water crisis and the looming escalation of that crisis is on the shelf and ready to go all we need is for the worlds nations to match their actions on water to their rhetoric

5270321 we do not want a deterioration of international relations we want to be respected we want our people our values to be respected

5270327 im not sure shes had a lot of experience with that sort of thing she found the lack of people there and even here in marietta very interesting it just isnt crowded we usually dont think of how uncrowded it is here
5270328 holy fuck im turning into my grandfather i just hope i dont get his bushy ass eyebrows too
5270329 i mean im excited and have an unbelievable feeling but it really hasnt sunk in
5270330 but when i saw the other weights coming in i started thinking about the idea of winning pretty seriously
5270331 ive just spent the last few minutes talking with michaels parents and telling them there are some secrets to being a champion that i want to share with him unfortunately no one shared them with me so i had to learn a lot of it on my own
5270332 tell the tour and your sponsors that you want to be useful and helpful and dont wait for things to come to you go to them the first thing i did after winning was go visit my sponsors and ask what i could do to help i meant it and im glad i did it
5270333 im not saying the championship shouldnt come with an automatic exemption for the next year
5270334 but i think its important for you and your sponsors to do everything you can to be a real champion otherwise you could win one year and be forgotten the next thats not what i have in mind i wanted to help everyone me included i think thats how you build a career that goes on and thats my goal

5270340 i definitely think that when i first heard the song from the beginning of the record you kind of feel like you know im leaving it up to you
5270341 and by the time it gets to the second verse and makes it to the end of the song it just feels like im saying i dont want to put up with it anymore
5270342 it was a great first single for me because it said something i fell in love with records like beyonc s irreplaceable where you could emotionally attach yourself to the record as soon as you heard it
5270343 i didnt want something so vague and so clubby because i wanted people to see me as a woman with something to say
5270344 i would say that an official girl is someone in a relationship

5270380 this attack proves beyond all reasonable doubts that this government is incapable of defining sustainable solutions to the ijaw and niger delta question
5270381 we condemn this attack and demand an explanation from the authorities concerned we also demand that these explanations be conveyed through the president of the ijaw youth council dr chris ekiyor
5270382 if this explanation is not provided within the next 24 hours there may be retaliatory attacks across the far ends of the niger delta
5270383 attacking a representative group of ijaw youth leaders who are on a peace mission aimed at creating real and lasting peace is not only satanic but a grave error that may result in the creation of widows and fatherless children amongst the malnourished families of the soldiers of the nigerian state that may be brought down in the event of a retaliatory attack against the bandit units of the joint task force jtf who rape our women assault our villages and loot our communities on a regular basis

5270437 why did such an attack take so long to happen
5270438 several hundred miles from new delhi and islamabad india pakistan hostility is spilling over into another country afghanistan here the two countries are engaged in an unacknowledged bid for supremacy in their bilateral relationship with afghanistan for the moment india seems to be winning this new version of the great game effortlessly
5270439 pakistans inter services intelligence isi agency is a global curse the massive and callous july 7 blast outside the indian embassy in kabul has exposed pakistans hollowness and duplicity for orchestrating the nefarious act the government of india was well aware about isis deceitful maneuverings some months ago no less a person than afghanistan president hamid karzai had cautioned india about what was going to befall and mar indian interests in afghanistan his assessment has proved correct pakistan has exhibited its classic example of hate india relationship with gusto and this time in a foreign country
5270440 it is nothing further than upsetting pakistan why should they india have consulates in jalalabad and khandahar what is their interest there is no interest other than disturbing pakistan doing something about pakistan
5270441 to assume greater responsibility as a stakeholder in the international system commensurate with its growing economic military and soft power
5270442 trilateral consensus between kabul delhi and washington on islamabad alone being the primary and near exclusive troublemaker in afghanistan
5270443 kabul replacing kashmir as the main area of antagonism and as the main area of indo pak antagonism
5270444 indias malicious intentions against pakistan and its efforts that aim to sabotage pakistan afghanistan relations
5270445 are engaged in undermining pakistans security from two fronts they are busy using the baluch card and the pashtun militant card
5270446 india is an eternal enemy of the ummah islamic community and would be confronted after defeating the allied forces stationed in afghanistan

5270451 de crocs zijn ook bij ons personeel populair bij ons geldt wel de regel dat de werkschoenen enkel en alleen in het ziekenhuis worden gedragen de schoenen die in de operatiekamer gedragen worden moeten daarenboven afwasbaar zijn of de crocs echt een gevaar vormen betwijfel ik ik zal voor alle zekerheid het oostenrijks onderzoek nader bekijken wij leveren enorme inspanningen om de vloeren in de kritische vertrekken zoals de operatiekamer en de intensieve zorgen niet geleidend te houden dat wordt immers streng gereglementeerd
5270452 ik was nauw betrokken bij de bouw van de nieuwe operatie en verloskamer we hebben toen kosten nog moeite gespaard en zijn voor de maximale beveiliging gegaan onze vloeren zijn supergeleidend bij tests waren de afwijkingen in de apparatuur verwaarloosbaar elk medisch apparaat is daarnaast medisch gekeurd en heeft tal van testen ondergaan
5270453 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5270454 that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys
5270455 a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5270456 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5270457 the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5270458 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5270459 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5270460 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5270461 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5270462 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5270463 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5270464 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5270465 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous
5270466 i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5270467 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5270468 i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on
5270469 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that its bad for the entire garage i think
5270470 if theyre going to make decisions based on parity after theyve given toyota what theyve given them with regard to parameters on their engine based on flawed data that a team or the manufacturer one of the other had kited or shaved that certainly is detrimental to my interests
5270471 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno

5270580 well i dont know if its concentration or apprehension i dont know what it is
5270581 i felt hibs were vulnerable i felt if we could get right at them we could have got an early goal it all was said in the dressing room
5270582 but there is a small thing as a coach i have been working very hard on the training ground and pitch maybe im giving them too much maybe they dont have the mental intelligence to take it in and then go and express themselves on the pitch
5270583 maybe i should just let them go and express themselves set it up and be hard to beat and let them go and play
5270584 we tried our best to get a system which suited thomas and it hasnt worked
5270585 it was the system to blame not the player or the club
5270586 celtic thomas gravesen and thomass representatives have agreed that he will part company with the club
5270587 i was delighted with the attitude and the character we showed for the spurs game and i want to have a look at a couple of games before making a final decision
5270588 im pleased to have added justin hoyte to the squad but we have no more bids in at the moment and it may stay that way
5270589 it may leave us a little bit short but then we have players who have proved they can play in a number of positions villa only had a small squad last season and they finished above us in the table
5270590 lho ucciso io ha dichiarato perch quel bambino era figlio di mio marito
5270591 im only going to bring quality in we havent got the money to go out and buy six 15m players
5270592 we dont have that so of course we are going to bring players in who are down at the lower end of the market but as ive always said im looking to get the main quality players in first then we will look at what we do after that
5270593 the only people who can give things a lift at the minute are the players who are here
5270594 the fans have been terrific and tried to stay behind the team we have just got to get on with things because nobody is going to feel sorry for us
5270595 blackburn they didnt feel sorry for us did they all we can do now is maximise everything that we have got here get the best from every single player
5270596 celtic got the breakthrough nakamura shunsuke does great for the goal hartley keeps his shot down and they go ahead
5270597 and then were sitting here thinking you do expect the response from dundee united because theyre pushing for the game and they have nothing to lose now they are trying to get a result
5270598 and you expect celtic to go on and win by two or three
5270599 five minutes after the goal big jan vennegoor of hesselink gets a great chance and really should have scored from 12 yards out he hits the target keeps it low but for me he really shouldve scored
5270600 sandaza looks a real threat he looks a good player and he made a difference today
5270601 we sat here watching the game and after 73 minutes we could sense that dundee united were going to get something because there was more purpose about their attack
5270602 when sandaza came on there was more belief and supply from conway craig and from grainger danny on the left hand side

5270686 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5270687 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5270688 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5270689 we have no confidence in these international observers in these people who corrupt the truth
5270690 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5270691 it was pointed out to the u s that u s officials public statements on the events in south ossetia need to be brought into compliance with the reality of the difficult situation in the region
5270692 russia was dragged into the military crisis as a result of the adventure by saakashvili who would not dare to start it without outside support
5270693 the same applies to the entire region there is such ethnic overlapping in literally all countries and all this talk of this is our land we are liberating our land must be dropped
5270694 one should not try to resolve the problems of the caucasus by force such attempts have been numerous and every time the result has been the same a legally binding agreement on the non use of force is needed if the west helped to reach such an agreement it would do a good job if it takes a different road of condemning russia and rearming georgia and u s officials are already speaking of that a new aggravation is inevitable and the outcome will be even worse
5270695 i wouldnt say theres a humanitarian catastrophe but theres an urgent need for primary products
5270696 now that i have learned their highest and lowest scores are the same the highest deduction score loses
5270697 i dont know if anybody understands what is going on
5270698 i knew i didnt have my best routine when i saw we got the same score and my name was second it was weird
5270699 we may have started out on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
5270700 if you voted for me you have much more in common with sen obama than you do with sen mccain
5270701 its only natural to seek an arrest warrant as weve determined that a crime was committed
5270702 regardless of the differences of opinion it is unacceptable that those involved in whaling get injured or have their lives put in danger
5270703 io voglio guarire voglio provare sensazioni quello che pensavo non era mai la realt voglio lasciar andare via il dolore che ho provato fino adesso cancellare proprio tutto il dolore io voglio guarire voglio provare sensazioni sentirmi vicina a qualcosa di vero voglio trovare qualcosa che ho voluto fino adesso qualche luogo a cui appartenere

5270706 we hope this is a good opportunity for our cooperation in fighting against terrorism and for eliminating the terrorist bases on the other side of durand line border
5270707 we hope that musharrafs resignation will have positive effects in strengthening of democracy and civilian government in pakistan
5270708 his demise was as tortured as his arrival was swift
5270709 it is a good move to lower tensions in multi confessional serbia
5270710 if art offends anybodys religious feelings then members of that confession should not be jeopardized
5270711 there is no book which can significantly influence anybodys interpretation and emotions in relation to certain values
5270712 to the extent home prices stabilize faster or oil continues to weaken these provide further upside to the baseline view
5270713 we shall never let anyone kill our citizens with impunity those who try will face a crushing response
5270714 russia has the economic political and military capacity for such a response and no one should have any illusions on that score

5270716 it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place if you want to get somewhere else you must run at least twice as fast as that
5270717 oh thats what youre talking about i thought you meant
5270718 the x band will be transferred not as an organic part of the israeli homeland defense but as a permanent deployment of u s capabilities and personnel to a site within israel which then connects to the homeland defense network via an interoperability node
5270719 we are looking at greater cooperation with them in terms of providing some additional capability and i think at this point ill just leave it general like that
5270720 were now into details and were moving forward to make this happen as soon as possible
5270721 theres no way well be able to do this in two or three months there are too many logistics legal and other issues to be worked out
5270722 we found ourselves fighting not only city hall but the greens and everyone else who were afraid of radiation poisoning
5270723 weve been studying architectures to provide an integrated layered defense that will plug into various architectures for the region for many years
5270724 and having an x band radar like the one we have in japan has always been part of our calculation
5270725 we took data from the radar and fed it into the ship and this allowed the ship to fire the interceptor way before its own radar ever saw it in the context of israel if we can take the radar out here and tie it into the arrow weapon system theyll be able to launch that interceptor way before they could with an autonomous system
5270726 the missile threat from iran is very real and we must stay ahead of the threat its critical to the defense of the united states critical to the defense of europe and obviously critical to israel and thats why were working so hard with all our allies to put the most optimized effective anti missile capability in place
5270727 the x band is a welcome enhancement to target tracking guidance and discrimination and could very well enhance the very capable detection ranges we already have in our green pine radar
5270728 once x band locks on a target its tracking is more precise and its resolution is greater than our own radar and this will give us invaluable discrimination information and significantly enhanced kill probability
5270729 since they threw in jtags its become a whole new ballgame were looking at a very generous gift from the united states even if it means we have to compromise on sovereignty by having u s troops deployed here
5270730 given the iranian presidents threat to wipe israel off the map we should put the full weight of the u s ballistic missile defense system behind our democratic ally
5270731 i never thought he would be putting me through some of the stuff im going through now

5270804 there cant be business as usual when an open conflict is going on in a territory that is a partner of nato with russia involved

5270807 the us poland the czech republic and a few other countries want nato to draw lessons from the georgia war they assume that nato made a mistake in bu charest
5270808 theyll say that russia has felt emboldened by natos refusal to give georgia and ukraine maps nato membership action plans the message they will say that russia took away from the bucharest decision is that pressure works

5270860 laboratory work in mice flies and worms shows that if igf1 is removed the animals tend not to get cancer
5270861 this is now mirrored in research into small humans who turn out to have no igf1 as in laron dwarfs
5270862 many problems have not been solved not even by the united nations and some want them to be solved during the beijing olympic committee
5270863 we think that you do not really understand chinas reality china has its own version and way of exercising our democracy
5270864 were properly addressed by relevant authorities or departments through consultations
5270865 we would like some transparency regarding who those citizens were what their issues were and how the has supposedly resolved those issues because we have justifiable concern about the whereabouts and safety of those individuals given that there have been several documented incidents in which chinese citizens who have legally applied have gone missing and are potentially in detention
5270866 i have lived all over since i became homeless including tunnels warehouses on the street and the houses of friends and relatives
5270867 what they have done to us is unlawful and unfair
5270868 i dont think they will give us any answers but despite this we still want to try to march within the law
5270869 in particular china remains a key driver of global commodity consumption through its position as a net importer of raw materials
5270870 in the context of the longer term growth the demand challenges that the world will deliver and the supply challenges that i have described the combination of bhp billiton and rio makes more sense than ever
5270871 we have achieved another year of record earnings driven by excellent operating performance cost control and the delivery of high margin growth projects into strong market conditions
5270872 the effects of current weaknesses in the developed economies on demand for our commodities should be minimal driven by ongoing strong demand from the emerging economies
5270873 heat islands form as vegetation is replaced by asphalt and concrete for roads buildings and other structures necessary to accommodate growing populations these surfaces absorb rather than reflect the suns heat causing surface temperatures and overall ambient temperatures to rise
5270874 wed eventually like to try to prevent the physical and cognitive decline associated with aging with a focus on people with alzheimers disease one of the key aspects of alzheimers disease is mitochondrial dysfunction specifically complex iv dysfunction which methylene blue improves our findings indicate that methylene blue by enhancing mitochondrial function expands the mitochondrial reserve of the brain adequate mitochondrial reserve is essential for preventing age related disorders such as alzheimers disease
5270875 to find that such a common and inexpensive drug can be used to increase and prolong the quality of life by treating such serious diseases is truly exciting
5270876 by being able to silence certain genes we may be able to suppress genes that can cause diseases such as hiv aids cancer inflammation and diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems we now know we can focus on these genes and potentially change the ultimate course of many diseases that have a major impact on peoples lives
5270877 our recent studies into what occurs during the chemical reaction caused by tamls proves that the catalysts are indeed really close mimics of peroxidase enzymes
5270878 by knowing the mechanics of the reactions we can fine tune the catalysts for even better performance
5270879 this event shows the pipes work and that if you put on great programming that people want to watch then theyll show up

5270882 in the 50s we were full of optimism in cuba we thought that fidel castro would bring about democracy for our country
5270883 it was soon evident after the revolution of 1959 that the political situation had deteriorated and personal freedoms were curtailed to the point that people feared for their lives and for the futures of their children
5270884 well its not broken but i do feel stuff jiggling around in there so i think i chipped the bone or it could just be muscular or tendons
5270885 dude i already told you it wasnt broken its either a chipped bone or the muscles and tendons
5270886 well i didnt look for those but the technician will be in tomorrow and will have a more in depth look at them
5270887 at uc berkeley ee100 is the introduction to electrical engineering class for non ee majors the goal of this course is to serve as a hands on electronics class we use multisim in the ee100 course because it is easy to use and abstracts the messy details of spice multisim also provides very useful features like the breadboard tool and instruments like the multimeter we can show students how to wire an ammeter without blowing fuses multisim also integrates with labview and this helps our students compare simulation data to experimental data
5270888 faith has always been a part of the united states from the very beginning the judeo chirstian ethic was at the roots of our country im thrilled that there is such an emphasis on faith now
5270889 i think its good that they are embracing the church more this country needs hope and needs healing and i think the church has the answers
5270890 i think when we are really able to express what our flaws and our failures could be to me beings a healing process not only externally but internally
5270891 no one of us is perfect everyone of us is a sinner and by the grace of god we have a relationship through him through his son jesus christ and that is a foundational part of any person who should be leading our country
5270892 i think that christianity does play a very important role in our socail and political lives but at the same time we cant afford to let it be taken out of context
5270893 i dont believe a person can lead this country unless they are willing to be led by something higher than themselves
5270894 we struggled all weekend but the team worked so hard for me and i tried as hard as i could every time i went out onto the track unfortunately this time it wasnt meant to be
5270895 its part of racing and it means that next time i go out that ill be fired up to make up for it theres a long way to go in my season yet and plenty of racing left to do and i know there will be more race wins before it finishes
5270896 its another big event and it would be great to bring home a title like that ill certainly be looking to have a better weekend there than in braga
5270897 will it happen i dont know it was fun sitting and telling the hbo guys and watching them shake their head and having writers on board and producers that are into it
5270898 we are what we think all that we are arises with our thought with our thoughts we make our world
5270899 mum can purchase and prepare the food but dads will often have less greens or just meat and potato the kids think mum makes me eat this and she is painted as the bad guy
5270900 fathers influence the food and physical activity habits in the home through their behaviours attitudes and approach to food and eating and act as a role model to their children
5270901 the eleven hundred shekels a of silver that were taken from you and about which i heard you utter a curse i have that silver with me i took it
5270902 i solemnly consecrate my silver to the lord for my son to make a carved image and a cast idol i will give it back to you
5270903 live with me and be my father and priest and ill give you ten shekels d of silver a year your clothes and your food
5270904 they the burmese junta have again taken an unlawful action
5270905 they did not even give us a chance to consult with lawyers before handing down the sentences for the five protesters
5270906 the authorities did not talk with witnesses but simply took action against the activists under two laws which prohibit joining a protest and creating public unrest
5270907 yet we are awake to the knowledge that the casual assumption of our greetings in earlier times today must be a matter for serious thought we in the americas are no longer a faraway continent to which eddies of controversies beyond the seas could bring no interest or no harm instead we in the americas have become a consideration for every propaganda office and every general staff beyond the seas the vast amount of our resources the vigour of our commerce and the strength of our men have made us vital factors in world peace whether we choose it or not
5270908 we as good neighbours are true friends because we maintain our own rights with frankness because we refuse to accept the twists of secret diplomacy because we settle our disputes by consultation and because we discuss our common problems in the spirit of the common good
5270909 it has been suggested that we cultivate three qualities to keep our foothold in the shifting sands of the present humility humanity and humour i have been thinking in terms of a bridge which is to be dedicated this afternoon and so i could not help coming to the conclusion that all of these three qualities imbedded in education build new spans to re establish free intercourse throughout the world and bring forth an order in which free nations can live in peace

5270913 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
5270914 hey do you see the customer standing at the counter
5270915 to accomplish this three years in a row as boise has done requires extraordinary effort
5270916 everyone in the homebuilding business has been challenged by the current market conditions
5270917 when overhead is reduced there is a risk that service suffers but according to our team members this has not been the case with boise cascade its a real tribute that while challenged by current market conditions boise continues to provide world class service to david weekley homes
5270918 what separates partner of choice winners from non winners is that through thick and thin they continue to add value to the relationship and help us provide a satisfying experience to our customer our number one goal
5270919 through all of the changes that continue to occur in the marketplace boise remains a constant in service delivery
5270920 another factor that makes boises third consecutive win all the more remarkable is that our survey data indicates there has been an average 18 annual improvement in scores posted by our trading partners
5270921 most companies either claim to be in pursuit of world class excellence or claim to have already achieved it the national trading partners survey is a practical way of measuring world class performance it goes beyond talk
5270922 when boise puts its products and services up against the very best every other company that supplies homebuilders across all product categories and excels three years in a row through their actions boise cascade has proven to us that they are truly world class
5270923 with bc estimator builders can now accommodate last minute plan changes without fear of losing profitability
5270924 its our goal to continue helping our customers use state of the art electronic tools to build faster and more profitably
5270925 we are very proud to work with david weekley homes on these important service initiatives to help reach their goal of the most satisfying experience for their home buying customers
5270926 the importance of being able to directly access these databases which store information about criminal and vehicle history in a mobile environment cannot be understated
5270927 not only does this access provide the officer with critical information it also eliminates the need for the officer to contact a dispatcher to obtain the information which at times can be delayed if the dispatcher is handling other calls or emergency situations
5270928 armed with fast and reliable tlets access partnered with the information sharing capabilities of copsync our customers have more information immediately available to them in the field than ever before enhancing their safety and effectiveness
5270929 decent numbers but a massive debt overhang is demanding better performance early next year 400 million comes due and if those payments cannot be made another 500 million will come due
5270930 stephan brings a diversity of business experience to our company from strategic planning to leadership positions in finance and human resources we look forward to his counsel and direction going forward
5270931 i am pleased to join the jetblue board of directors
5270932 jetblue is at the point in its history where decisions made today have long lasting impact on its competitiveness as a unique brand i look forward to the challenge
5270933 in large complex 90 nm designs the wires are very close to each other and without a fast and advanced router addressing crosstalk can become a time consuming and costly challenge
5270934 we adopted the magma flow after it was shown to dramatically shorten the physical design cycle while allowing us to achieve high utilization and meet aggressive timing requirements
5270935 netxens network adapters are used by the worlds top server manufacturers
5270936 their impressive product line and exacting requirements makes their products a good fit for magmas software capabilities were pleased to be working with a leader in the networking market
5270937 i am thrilled to contribute a portion of my wsop earnings to the prevent cancer foundation
5270938 charity involvement has always been an important part of my life and hopefully more poker players and final table participants with follow suit in upcoming poker circuits like the european poker tour and the pokerstars caribbean adventure
5270939 dennis phillips is a stand up guy who brings a positive feeling to the wsop final table
5270940 most guys get to the final table and just see a big pile of money and a new life dennis is just happy to be playing poker and sees an opportunity to help others his efforts are inspiring to the poker community and im excited to see how it all turns out in november
5270941 power and money in the democratic party is being centralized around a key iconic figure obama is consolidating power within the party
5270942 i was the polling adviser for the democratic leadership council back then
5270943 clintons candidacy and that effort was very much focused on addressing the historical problems of the democratic party
5270944 clinton became very identified with the presidential wing of the party
5270945 but there was a lot of resentment from the daschle and gephardt people to the way they were treated by the clinton people i think the people who acted in clintons name didnt generate an awful lot of goodwill for them
5270946 thats incredible the guys been there for three fucking years
5270947 all the candidates lined up within 20 yards of each other on virtually every question that is an important interesting change that shouldnt be overlooked in the democratic party
5270948 fundraising was a zero sum game for a significant part of the democratic partys recent history
5270949 clinton viewed the dnc and the party in general as a vehicle for fundraising and media
5270950 when you were raising your money mostly through large donors and pacs there was a continual sense that there was a limited amount of money that could be raised and if you spent it now you couldnt spend it later
5270951 now theres a totally different view of money the more you spend the more you raise
5270952 we benefited from the thing people complained about which was that kerry was hardcore about targeting
5270953 if you were targeted you got everything you needed and if you werent you got nothing people who werent targeted were pretty bitter being told that if they wanted buttons they had to go to the kerry web site and buy them
5270954 as good as it was for colorado it wasnt a sustainable model
5270955 i am proud of the fact that were the first campaign in a generation to run a 50 state strategy
5270956 not a 50 percent plus one strategy but a 50 state strategy made possible by the volunteer activism and organizing you and others have made on the ground and support by governor deans efforts at the dnc
5270957 which is not only win but leave something behind so we can begin to turn south carolina blue in the years to come
5270958 the 50 state strategy is certainly not the unanimous strategy
5270959 if obama were to lose those folks would come out of the woodwork
5270960 there are a lot of people in this congress who are heavily invested in the status quo
5270961 obama has got to guide congress to get the results that he wants its a tough relationship
5270962 is not what happens if obama loses or if he wins and continues to build but if he gets there and leaves out his grass roots
5270963 were building lasting infrastructure which will not only help us win in november but build the progressive movement for years to come
5270964 our 50 state strategy isnt just about winning the presidential election but lifting democrats up and down the ticket we have a historic opportunity to elect more democrats at every level from city councils to state legislatures to the united states congress and thats how were going to bring about a working democratic majority and thats how were going to see real change in america
5270965 i think the american people are hungry for something different and can be mobilized around big changes not incremental changes not small changes
5270966 i think that there are a whole host of republicans and certainly independents who have lost trust in their government who dont believe anybody is listening to them who are staggering under rising costs of health care college education who dont believe what politicians say and we can draw those independents and some republicans into a working coalition a working majority for change
5270967 most of the protesters were charged with criminal trespass and released on 50 bonds
5270968 sou o z das monas e estive aqui no dia tal as tantas horas para qualquer servi o no g nero fa o descontos para grandes quantidades e pre os m dicos para reformados carentes
5270969 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs
5270970 its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
5270971 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5270972 democrats should take a deep breath and realize that there are a group of voters who wont make up their mind about a candidate until deep in the fall
5270973 and there are 18 states that are battlegrounds for a reason and theyll be decided by 2 to 4 points i dont care about national polls
5270974 i think senator obama is a motivational speaker but at the end of the day i dont think that will translate into votes and certainly not the image of strength that ronald reagan had
5270975 florida has not yet been locked down by either candidate or all but won by either candidate but i think obamas inability to prove his experience or prove that he owns a political issue far more than mccain is a real problem for him
5270976 the one area he still needs credibility in is experience and picking an
5270977 it wouldnt be bad if he came out early and said who his secretary of defense and secretary of state would be that would address and stabilize the concerns about his experience
5270978 in rural parts of georgia and the south there is still some fear about people who look different from themselves
5270979 and theres also healing left to do among women who wanted to see the day that a woman was elected president
5270980 i would really like to see him do things in tennessee that would help in other working class and blue collar places like ohio
5270981 job security and health care are huge here he needs to come to the aisle of home depot and show them that a harvard graduate which i am as well knows how to help them
5270982 im just relieved ill be able to get on the bus again
5270983 i phoned them up and they said theyd send one out to me to show drivers i think every mother who asks for one now will get one if they phone up
5270984 id like people to hand one to the driver of every bus they get on saying they object to this policy whether they push a buggy or not
5270985 we dont want to behave in a hostile way to drivers or hold anyone up but we just want to make it clear how many people their customers think this is outrageous its so intimidating waiting for a bus and not knowing whether youll be allowed on
5270986 what are you supposed to do if youve got a six week old baby who cant go in a foldable buggy its not possible to carry your baby all the time
5270987 it can be very hard for mothers with young children to get around as it is the last thing lothian buses should be doing is alienating so many passengers
5270988 most parents are happy to get off a bus if a wheelchair users needs the space
5270989 i would definitely support this i think handing out cards is a good way for people to show lothian buses what they think
5270990 speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves for the rights of all who are destitute 9 speak up and judge fairly defend the rights of the poor and needy
5270991 many women do noble things but you surpass them all
5270992 forsten den berg von zahlen der vorigen woche durch und beginnen nun ihre portfolios umzuschichten

5270994 der aktienmarkt schaut auf w hrungen und commodities denn auf der makro und earningsseite ist es jetzt ruhiger geworden
5270995 die aktien der fluggesellschaften hatten vom lpreisr ckgang besonders stark profitiert
5270996 einige analysten haben das r wort in den mund genommen
5270997 und in einer rezession braucht man nun wirklich keine aktien der metro von adidas oder der lufthansa
5270998 there are many advertisers out there that would like the opportunity to understand what the sports illustrated brand is about what those offerings are that we just physically cant get to
5270999 i have everything here to do it and it can be done in one push of action

5271043 women accounted for 6 of directors in 2007 a decline of one percentage point since 2006 this figure is almost half the percentage of women directors working in 2000 when women accounted for 11 of all directors
5271044 there are 39 film festivals solely dedicated to showing the work of women directors throughout the world
5271045 the progress of humanity depends on men and women working together therefore both must be equally developed women given equal opportunities for education have already proven to be the equals of men in intellectual and creative capacity men must encourage and facilitate the full development of women as women must support men in their development towards this new condition of society

5271054 well i just know that the russian president said several days ago russian military operations would stop they didnt

5271056 as soon as were done filming keeping up with the kardashians im probably going to spend most of my time in new orleans for a little bit until hes done with the nfl season

5271068 if this rehashed inconclusive and dated research is being used to deny women in the uk who seek an abortion the right to counselling then its a fairly desperate act on behalf of the abortion industry and those who wish to deny women the right to make a fully informed decision
5271069 the government had made it very clear that it wants the new law to reflect public opinion
5271070 this survey shows that opinion in great detail the public does not want sanctions for doctors if the government has settled on a law that includes sanctions it should be rethought
5271071 we need to take a serious look at the kind of wasteful expenditure that has gone on around the olympic games
5271072 now makhenkesi stofile the minister of sport and recreation seems to have wasted r11 million of taxpayers money on a publicity expo for south africa
5271073 the organisation of the expo has been a shambles sic we urge the portfolio committee on sport to summon the department to explain why so much money has been squandered on an opportunity to market our country
5271074 number of interesting ideas to extend light rail services throughout sydney
5271075 the government definitely seems to have an ideological problem with light rail there have been many studies done in the last decade most showing its feasibility but the only project that has been built is the central to lilyfield section
5271076 and this is going great passenger patronage has doubled over the last year and the metro company is very keen to extend the line to dulwich hill i think the problem is with a government and a bureaucracy whose planning is done by people who dont get out enough
5271077 former roads minister carl scully dubbed it a pipe dream and transport minister john watkins is on record as saying its a bad answer for sydney but higher oil prices are here to stay l ight rail is a far better investment for the future than roads
5271078 given the failure of recent large scale road projects the public is right to ask to know more d ocuments should be made public so the community can decide whether sydneys motorway plans make sense
5271079 as vile of a man that i think stern is he went too far this time and you sirius satellite radio pay his salary and give him his own show to spew his hate and bullshit we myself family friends and tawns many fans are completely outraged with this i want action i want mr stern to apologize publicly he had no right to make that statement he didnt get her fans but he got his wish of death hes a disgusting pig and should never have been allowed to open his mouth angela
5271080 if you love her youve got to fight for her cos love is the only thing that matters and if youve found someone if you think you can make it work for fucks sake youve got to try
5271081 its done im gonna get me another woman take it like a man
5271082 friends is what matters and the people you love thats all that counts
5271083 and she said dont come in my mouth will you and i was like no of course not but then i did
5271084 it was a shocking set of remarks and people were looking around the room in disbelief
5271085 it was far more blatant a threat than anything were used to hearing from many of the leaders
5271086 the whole thing was incredible malcolm got up there and thanked everyone for coming and told them we should think of his fund raising event as being like an ipo an initial public offering
5271087 he said we should get in early because then it doesnt cost as much the longer you wait to get in he said the more it will cost you and if you dont get in at all then it will be painful after november after the democrats win the majority
5271088 then he referred to bronx state sen jeff klein about four times as his enforcer who is going to be brutal aggressive about collecting the contributions and that he was the one managing the ipo
5271089 ninety five per cent of our customers say that theyre satisfied or very satisfied other financial services companies would die for 95 per cent satisfaction levels in the uk market
5271090 one should welcome the fact that people are having access to finance but not at these terms
5271091 we dont offer teaser rates we dont do free gifts we dont do loyalty programmes or zero per cent transfers were very clear that this is the price we dont bring people in under false premises
5271092 theres some credit scoring but its mainly about a face to face meeting with the customer and thats a razor sharp tool
5271093 you can see that persons income outgoings circumstances how secure their job is and you look round the front room to see whether everything theyre telling you stacks up thats why we can serve these customers profitably when others might struggle to do so with a different business model
5271094 when i got here there were no pcs on desks in the branches they were using a paper system with an old green screen computer to do the accounts
5271095 i wanted customers to be able to access the better deals you get online which you cant do with 20 notes
5271096 weve got some people whove been borrowing from us for 15 years and have repaid every loan on the nail and we really want to keep them
5271097 in terms of the business hes taken to it like a duck to water but hes probably taken a little while longer to stop seeing the share price volatility as a reflection of the management when its more a sign of whats happening in the wider sector
5271098 i believe in a thin corporate centre and having mds running each business who are accountable for their end to end business
5271099 we dont do shared services they have all their resources and are held to account for what theyve promised
5271100 im not the sort of person who interferes but i look at the numbers regularly and if things start to move away from where they should be then were going to have a conversation about it very quickly
5271101 there are other fair weather friends who lent to them in the good times but have folded their tents and gone now
5271102 were there for them in the thick and thin im proud of what we do

5271105 i have been trying to get the business in as good a shape as possible so we can take advantage when the markets start to get better
5271106 i wasnt at ibrox or parkhead last week so thats how far those rumours went

5271110 solo il dolore fa crescere ma il dolore va preso di petto chi svicola o si compiange destinato a perdere
5271111 da qualche parte non ricordo non molto tempo fa ho letto un motto degli indiani d america che diceva
5271112 abbi cura di te ogni volta in cui crescendo avrai voglia di cambiare le cose sbagliate in cose giuste ricordati che la prima rivoluzione da fare quella dentro se stessi la prima e la piu importante lottare per un idea senza avere un idea di s una delle cose piu pericolose che si possano fare ogni volta che ti sentirai smarrita confusa pensa agli alberi ricordati del loro modo di crescere ricordati che un albero con molta chioma e poche radici viene sradicato al primo colpo di vento mentre in un albero con molte radici e poca chioma la linfa scorre a stento radici e chioma devono crescere in egual misura devi stare nelle cose e starci sopra solo cos potrai offrire ombra e riparo solo cos alla stagione giusta potrai coprirti di fiori e di frutti
5271113 lungo i bivi della tua strada incontri le altre vite conoscerle o non conoscerle viverle a fondo o lasciarle perdere dipende soltanto dalla scelta che fai in un attimo anche se non lo sai tra proseguire dritto o deviare spesso si gioca la tua esistenza e quella di chi ti sta vicino
5271114 in quella notte all improvviso mi ero accorta di una cosa e cio che tra la nostra anima e il nostro corpo ci sono tante piccole finestre da l se sono aperte passano le emozioni se sono socchiuse filtrano appena solo l amore le pu spalancare tutte insieme e di colpo come una raffica di vento
5271115 sai qual l errore che si fa sempre quello di credere che la vita sia immutabile che una volta preso un binario lo si debba percorrere fino in fondo il destino invece ha molta piu fantasia di noi proprio quando credi di trovarti in una situazione senza via di scampo quando raggiungi il picco della disperazione massima con la velocit di una raffica di vento tutto cambia si stravolge e da un momento all altro ti trovi a vivere una nuova vita
5271116 per essere forti bisogna amare se stessi per amare se stessi bisogna conoscersi in profondit sapere tutto di s anche le cose piu difficili da accettare
5271117 l unico maestro che esiste l unico vero e credibile la propria coscienza per trovarla bisogna stare in silenzio da soli e in silenzio bisogna stare sulla nuda terra nudi e senza nulla intorno come se si fosse gi morti
5271118 how would you like to solve all your domestic energy problems through the miracle of offshore drilling it sounds too good to be true but its a sure fire thing i tell you
5271119 the american consumer is suffering from a lack of unrealistic cure all solutions
5271120 if we allow grifters to drill their ideas into the us consciousness we could blind the electorate to the need for hard energy policy choices until well beyond the november election
5271121 please remember that these are two separate sets of funds
5271122 we are very excited that we are able to help programs through the grants but want to be sure that we dont lose sight of the fact that our existing united way funded agencies are still dependent on contributions made during the campaign
5271123 from the information received in the grant applications we will be reaching over 11 000 people directly and many many more indirectly though these grants

5271127 what are those feeble jews doing will they restore their wall will they offer sacrifices will they finish in a day can they bring the stones back to life from those heaps of rubble burned as they are
5271128 what they are building if even a fox climbed up on it he would break down their wall of stones
5271129 the strength of the laborers is giving out and there is so much rubble that we cannot rebuild the wall
5271130 before they know it or see us we will be right there among them and will kill them and put an end to the work
5271131 dont be afraid of them remember the lord who is great and awesome and fight for your brothers your sons and your daughters your wives and your homes
5271132 the work is extensive and spread out and we are widely separated from each other along the wall 20 wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet join us there our god will fight for us
5271133 have every man and his helper stay inside jerusalem at night so they can serve us as guards by night and workmen by day
5271134 we and our sons and daughters are numerous in order for us to eat and stay alive we must get grain
5271135 we are mortgaging our fields our vineyards and our homes to get grain during the famine
5271136 we have had to borrow money to pay the kings tax on our fields and vineyards 5 although we are of the same flesh and blood as our countrymen and though our sons are as good as theirs yet we have to subject our sons and daughters to slavery some of our daughters have already been enslaved but we are powerless because our fields and our vineyards belong to others
5271137 as far as possible we have bought back our jewish brothers who were sold to the gentiles now you are selling your brothers only for them to be sold back to us
5271138 what you are doing is not right shouldnt you walk in the fear of our god to avoid the reproach of our gentile enemies 10 i and my brothers and my men are also lending the people money and grain but let the exacting of usury stop 11 give back to them immediately their fields vineyards olive groves and houses and also the usury you are charging them the hundredth part of the money grain new wine and oil
5271139 and we will not demand anything more from them we will do as you say
5271140 in this way may god shake out of his house and possessions every man who does not keep this promise so may such a man be shaken out and emptied
5271141 come let us meet together in one of the villages e on the plain of ono
5271142 i am carrying on a great project and cannot go down why should the work stop while i leave it and go down to you
5271143 it is reported among the nations and geshem f says it is true that you and the jews are plotting to revolt and therefore you are building the wall moreover according to these reports you are about to become their king 7 and have even appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in jerusalem there is a king in judah now this report will get back to the king so come let us confer together
5271144 nothing like what you are saying is happening you are just making it up out of your head
5271145 their hands will get too weak for the work and it will not be completed
5271146 let us meet in the house of god inside the temple and let us close the temple doors because men are coming to kill you by night they are coming to kill you
5271147 should a man like me run away or should one like me go into the temple to save his life i will not go

5271155 we feel it is time for the wave of north american aliyah its our turn there is a wellspring of idealistic zionist jews who will contribute to israel from the moment they arrive at the airport
5271156 american olim who come with their background in democracy as well as in jewish and zionist education are in a unique position to contribute to israeli society conservative jews not only help us to strengthen our democratic social and political values but also bring the value of religious pluralism

5271165 i found the idea on a website on farm diversification
5271166 i thought it would be good to be able to offer people who like local food something a bit different
5271167 snails have been farmed in britain for centuries and there is lots of archaeological evidence to back that up
5271168 in the monasteries the monks would have a fish pond beehives and a snail farm
5271169 and there are lots of placed in kent where there is evidence the romans farmed snails
5271170 they are quite endearing they dont bite or smell unpleasant or make a lot of noise and they are really quite friendly
5271171 and they dont take up much space which is a really good benefit
5271172 it will consider opening portions of the offshore outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
5271173 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
5271174 while the speaker now claims to embrace a comprehensive energy plan that includes more conservation more innovation and more american energy production the fact is her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices

5271182 behind the world food crisis is a global freshwater crisis expected to rapidly worsen as climate change impacts intensify
5271183 irrigation fed agriculture provides 45 per cent of the worlds food supplies and without it we could not feed our planets population of six billion people
5271184 millions of people depend on freshwater fisheries as a major food source
5271185 freshwater food stocks can provide up to 80 per cent of dietary protein for the 60 million people of the mekong basin for example and thats just one river
5271186 freshwater systems are home to around 40 per cent of all the species on earth
5271187 and our impact is shown by the fact that we are losing these species faster than any other
5271188 a global treaty for co operatively managing rivers and lakes that cross or form borders is still languishing in limbo more than a decade after being approved by a clear majority in the united nations
5271189 water management for human needs alone is damaging the natural systems we all depend on
5271190 maintaining the health of freshwater ecosystems has to become one of the major aims of freshwater management generally
5271191 we are also concerned that the world continues to mainly discuss adaption to climate change rather than doing it
5271192 we have been doing it all over the world and we have found that that improving the health of freshwater ecosystems now makes a great contribution to improving their resilience to climate impacts in the future
5271193 it is ironic that currently it is not foresight and planning but major natural disasters that lead to significant efforts to repair damaged rivers and wetlands foresight and planning now will reduce the risk and damage from future extreme weather events while having many economic social and environmental benefits
5271194 even this tiny proportion however would be enough for humans to live on earth if the water cycle was properly functioning and if we managed our water use wisely
5271195 these are combining to create a kind of a perfect storm that we have going on right now
5271196 you see it in rising food prices rising energy prices and a great land grab to produce biofuels the easiest way to grow these crops is to grab lands in the tropics from rainforests
5271197 meanwhile the developing world sees climate change as a train crashing through their countries but something that is not their fault
5271198 forests fall because they are worth more cut down than standing this is a classic example of a market failure
5271199 philanthropy and taxes by governments arent going to be enough to fund forest conservation efforts on the kind of scale thats going to be needed to have a real impact
5271200 but for a market 10 15 billion is quite manageable thats about what we drink in wine and champagne every year in britain for a fraction of the percent of the three trillion dollar a year insurance business we could save forests
5271201 the central issue in this whole debate is how we put a true value on standing rainforest to the world community
5271202 the indigenous communities probably have the best track record of any group in looking after their forests and preventing deforestation
5271203 the problem that we face is that under the redd mechanism being developed by the un there is a danger that these groups wont see compensation because they have a low deforestation baseline and are therefore not emitting
5271204 we need to think about how these communities who have succeeded in protecting their forests should get paid as i see it a method for this is the ecosystem services they are providing the world
5271205 the world is waking up to this and will drive capital to the canopy
5271206 how much money would you be prepared to pay governor braga of amazonas to keep the rain coming
5271207 a primary driver of deforestation is agribusiness in the amazon
5271208 why did this investment happen the very first in the world in iwokrama
5271209 okay so you are going to pay people for ecosystem services now that is just paying people to do nothing so youre going to pay them not to cut down their trees what are they going to do sleep in hammocks and drink beer
5271210 we dont need too much we are happy for our capital to be employed and will take a small return
5271211 well that means all the money will go to aaa

5271275 according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5271276 there is no such notion anymore in georgia as russian peacekeepers
5271277 there can be no russian peacekeepers these are just russian forces
5271278 that may be an indication that some sort of a withdrawal is on the way
5271279 but what we saw on the roads from tbilisi to gori this morning were people who were essentially reinforcing their positions
5271280 they had diggers who were digging holes for tanks to move into so they could be camouflaged from the road
5271281 we also saw armoured personnel carriers being hidden in trees with their guns sticking out and soldiers digging trenches in gun positions this doesnt look like an army ready to move

5271315 we were unanimous that the forum should have been allowed to proceed
5271316 those who had united to oppose the forum had no understanding of the issue at hand
5271317 in view of the sensitive reactions and wrong perception among a section of the malay muslim community
5271318 we cant achieve any sense of mutual agreement unless we are willing to talk and openly to one another about the issues that matter

5271320 the protestors should have come out with their proposals in addressing the issue of non muslim husbands who abandon their spouses and their families and convert into islam rather than stop a legitimate forum

5271330 we will encourage graduate recruits to work in this area in the future
5271331 this is a sign that people in all sorts of public services are looking in a different way at how to recruit talented people
5271332 previously public services were delivered by the man from the ministery who was white and heterosexual that is now changing

5271341 i am disappointed not to win i cant fault the players application or performance we are not going to have easy games the bottom line is that we knew what to expect from them but ultimately it is going to be about what we do ourselves
5271342 it is a team game and everyone played their part we did everything we could to try to win but it didnt quite fall for us
5271343 i am not one for getting uptight about things like that i have every confidence in my players that firstly we are creating chances and secondly we are getting in the right areas

5271358 clearly the fundamental element in this story is the person who did this honor killing

5271362 the members of his muslim sect went on rampage demonstrating against america and the state of israel over claims that it was the prayers of christians over the aborting of the gospel event of 2004 that caused their leader to be involved in an auto crash dr olukade the muslim sects leader died in may 2008 and since then muslim fanatics have embarked in serial killings and attacks on christians in the city
5271363 the corpse of another christian victim was found along stadium road with his bible beside him on june 18
5271364 so also a young christian girl living near the stadium road was also murdered in the same manner within this period
5271365 nanle nathaniel was attacked on june 11 near our church
5271366 he saw a man with a machete coming towards him and before he realized what was happening the man cut him on his head with the machete and thereafter fled
5271367 i was there shortly after she was attacked and i personally took pictures of her and interviewed her
5271368 she was a trader returning from the ministry of agriculture where she sells food
5271369 only yesterday august 7 i was told that another christian was attacked by the railway station in the city
5271370 the police recovered an iron rod from the scene where she was attacked all those killed or attacked are christians

5271372 tablighi jamaat has always adopted an extreme interpretation of sunni islam
5271373 but in the past two decades it has radicalized to the point where it is now a driving force of islamic extremism and a major recruiting agency for terrorist causes worldwide
5271374 however two days into the five day event the government again brought the police to stop the event
5271375 the event was aborted following opposition from muslims in the city

5271379 the terrorists are not going to surrender they have long term objectives in the region
5271380 this is a positive change but it is just the beginning
5271381 if the government ends these policies the taliban will stop their activities immediately
5271382 he should also be awarded strict punishment because he is a culprit of the whole country
5271383 what i found out is that combustion generated particles contain environmentally persistent free radicals
5271384 when the radicals are associated with particles they can apparently exist indefinitely
5271385 the implication is you can have the same environmentally related diseases by exposure to airborne fine particles that you can get from cigarettes
5271386 these airborne free radicals are of interest but i am not sure we are at a point where our scalpel is sharp enough to dissect the individual components of air pollution that cause problems for people
5271387 there are studies that show that modifying free radicals can alter the course of disease
5271388 but the implications of this what it means to clinics what it means to doctors what it means to regulators i think we are a long way from pulling that together
5271389 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
5271390 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares 50 million acres across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
5271391 in over 70 percent of the cities studied more than half of urban agricultural land is irrigated with wastewater that is either raw or diluted in streams
5271392 in the face of water scarcity generally and a lack of access to clean water urban farmers will have no alternative except to use diluted or untreated wastewater or polluted river water

5271412 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness

5271428 mccain judgment and a response to the attacks of 9 11
5271429 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5271430 mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused
5271431 for this to have been the case that means the this so called
5271432 beyond the teraflops why intel really put 80 cores on a single chip
5271433 it is always good to start the season with goals tonights match was important to us but it didnt end as we had hoped it would the good thing is that weve scored two goals away from home the game at the bernab u wont be easy because no opponent is especially valencia we count on our fans to help us win the super cup
5271434 i think robinho is training and playing like he always does we all support him
5271435 we will try to win every title not just the champions league we want to prepare well for every match and be very successful this year
5271436 weve all seen how good van der vaart is during the pre season he is more than a great player he is excellent
5271437 theres still much to do at this early stage of the season im sure we will play much better before our fans
5271438 we knew the game would be intense because a title is at stake i think both sides played well but some things still dont work at this point in the season i think both teams had good moments
5271439 valencia are returning to be the team we expect them to be none of us understood what happened to them last year they mostly have the same players i think they are on the right path to improving
5271440 the four starting defenders had played more games than anyone else in the pre season so i decided they were the best to start we should be careful and avoid forcing players who havent played more than 45 minutes per game to make too much of an effort
5271441 what i least liked is that we gave valencia too much life at some points we lost concentration at times and lost the ball too quickly on the other hand we reacted well to the 2 1 result i think we did some very good things but not everything is working as well as we hoped
5271442 we will have to fight hard for 90 minutes next week winning 1 0 would be enough for us to win the title we will play much better at the bernab u i believe we will come back to win the title
5271443 robben has worked hard throughout the pre season this could be his year
5271444 there were a couple of times when they told us to just shut up

5271454 today in line with the plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers has begun
5271455 georgian patrol police stopped the convoy of six russian armoured vehicles in the borjomi outskirts
5271456 following the georgian police intervention the russians turned back towards kashuri
5271457 there is no real sign of a withdrawal so it is difficult to understand what is going on with the russians
5271458 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces or people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5271459 theres some conflict due to whats been described as a feeding frenzy for renewable energy in the desert

5271461 were really at the forefront of a discussion that is certainly going to be repeated throughout the state of california and nationally as well
5271462 all of us are going to face this challenge of where to build transmission corridors in a way that is going to impact the local communities as little as possible
5271463 its interesting that we consider some of these areas as pristine and we dont want to put turbines or solar or transmission lines there but they are suitable for housing development theres sort of an irony there
5271464 the land were likely to plow up is the land that weve had taking up carbon for decades

5271466 gt my rhapsody april 28th city hall play in amp san francisco strybing arboretum town hall meeting of may 8 2008
5271467 the light brown apple moth does not damage crops or native plants in new zealand where it was introduced more than 100 years ago and the state has clearly stated that the lbam has done no crop damage in california entomologists say that based on its range the moth has likely been here for 30 50 years long enough for us to have seen evidence of damage in addition the natural predators that keep it under control in new zealand are also present here in california the california department of food and agriculture cdfa and the u s department of agriculture usda should be using sound integrated pest management ipm which would require that they first monitor to determine the degree to which the moth is already being parasitized by native predators no additional controls may be necessary if studies ever show crop damage from the lbam the state should use least toxic control strategies that support the healthy functioning of the ecosystem these might include release of sterile moths or the use of pheromone sticky traps but the actual safety and effectiveness of any alternative strategy should be fully studied before it is employed
5271468 i think they must be feeling under pressure on this issue because theres not one authority which really supports the retention of this target now that the decision has been made to introduce an emissions trading scheme

5271470 there is a huge transformation in the adoption of information communication technology in this part of the world and malaysia is surging ahead to put in an infrastructure that will enable it to leapfrog ahead in enabling citizens to benefit from this digital highway
5271471 when the project is completed we will have contributed to help transform kuala lumpur into a wireless digital city and be able to provide wireless access to more than 90 of the citys 1 5 million residents

5271475 this figure is bound to increase as growing cities coincide with escalating food shortages to create a squeeze on agricultural water supply

5271477 i am worried about the toxins especially heavy metals accumulating in foods like root crops
5271478 but often there is simply no other water in many ways it is a great use of the waste and the nutrients it contains

5271488 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5271489 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5271490 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5271491 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5271492 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5271493 we initially hypothesized that proximity to a highway would affect less affluent mothers to a greater extent than affluent ones we thought that less affluent mothers living near a highway would disproportionally suffer from the double burden of economic disadvantage and pollution
5271494 the impact of exposure to additional risk factors like traffic related air pollution among disadvantaged mothers may not be as significant as it is among affluent mothers who are relatively protected from these well identified risk factors
5271495 our concern is that the interest in the carbon value of forests could lead to a land grab motivating outside actors to come in and take over forest areas and drive local people off their land
5271496 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
5271497 its goal is to bring together as much information as possible and to make it accessible to researchers of all kinds and members of the public
5271498 so that it becomes a lot easier to answer questions about what really is in this country what its doing what its chances are under climate change and other threats and to really help us all to manage our environment somewhat better
5271499 its a job to bring together information from the natural history collections from field workers of various kinds and from members of the public to place their observations into a context that can be used for modelling and understanding a bit more about the real requirements of each of those species
5271500 weve only named probably about 10 to 20 per cent of australian insects
5271501 so most insects we dont know yet and the ones we do know we only have a limited amount of information
5271502 so really we have no idea about their distribution or where they are likely to live or what their biology is
5271503 what that means is we dont have the information we need that might help conserve them
5271504 strict data basing it would take about a thousand person years
5271505 but there is a lot of work that has to go into the collection first in terms of updating the curation to make it available
5271506 so what we really need to do is thinking about ways of automating the entire process to expedite things
5271507 one of the earliest things well be offering is at least the beginnings of a system which allows users to enter the name of a species and find a summary view of what we know about their distribution from those data sets that are already connected
5271508 probably thumbnail images and links to literature resources and web pages that we know of for those species
5271509 they are going to be some of the early results from this
5271510 the longer terms goals are probably actually for the atlas to be much more invisible and for it to be providing some of the kind of tools that plug into other websites that are bringing information to the public
5271511 the purpose of the atlas isnt simply to exist in its own right as a final place for information but to take it to the places where it can be used and made most beneficial
5271512 we have no idea where you are going so how can we know the way
5271513 i am the way the truth and the life no one can come to the father except through me 7 if you had really known me you would know who my father is from now on you do know him and have seen him
5271514 lord show us the father and we will be satisfied
5271515 have i been with you all this time philip and yet you still dont know who i am anyone who has seen me has seen the father so why are you asking me to show him to you
5271516 i tell you the truth anyone who believes in me will do the same works i have done and even greater works because i am going to be with the father

5271525 human culture as we have known it for the past 200 years is drawing to a close a revolution of civilization is upon us prepare

5271536 no one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and uses it to patch an old garment for then the new garment would be ruined and the new patch wouldnt even match the old garment

5271551 the question is how to get this growth so that it is not a problem
5271552 you have to ask is this a need or a demand
5271553 of course this is not just a discussion for spain it happens in california it happens in portugal in greece in italy what we are trying to introduce is a new message with the tradition that there is a message of cost a message of responsibility and a message of scarcity included in how we plan
5271554 its the height of hypocrisy for zaragoza to be having an expo that touts water sustainability
5271555 zaragoza is one of the biggest culprits in what ails spain too many farmers using too much irrigated land
5271556 look i am not an apologist for chinas environmental record its record and legacy are a traumatic one
5271557 but we have all seen the efforts being made at these olympics and they hold promise a bit less judgment for what chinas progressive leaders are trying to do might be appropriate at this stage
5271558 china did not start planting trees at the olympics that began 20 years ago now it is one of the only asian countries where forest cover is increasing the chinese have proven to themselves they are capable of far reaching innovation
5271559 china has some of the worst environmental problems in the world but it is paying more attention to both pollution and degradation they realise environmental degradation affects economic development
5271560 this should give the reformers and progressive environmental groups in the government far greater possibility for influence
5271561 people in beijing are not going to forget that the air can be cleaner
5271562 i have based my assessment on the empirical evidence i have no reason to doubt that the numbers are genuine
5271563 ive been to beijing a lot and walked outside so i felt the difference and subjectively if you compare it to an average day in nairobi you can taste more sulphur in the air there
5271564 i see china accelerating environmental efforts much more than other developing nations
5271565 improvement does not mean you have reached an optimum state of affairs though
5271566 i think there are some very strong growth signals in these results stronger than i can ever remember seeing in vestas
5271567 in particular i want to highlight the order book of 7 2 billion i might have bid 5 5 billion if i had been optimistic
5271568 somebody has to be first on the dance floor and so we started
5271569 we have done a lot of work on cutting down emissions and saving energy hebeis effort in cutting down emissions and saving energy has contributed a lot to improving beijings air quality
5271570 theres a huge amount happening on the environmental front related to chinas sense of what it means to be a developed nation and part of being developed is to have a pleasant and healthy environment
5271571 that intertwines with the olympics because part of the point of the olympics is to show weve made it
5271572 on the surface the shutdowns were for the olympics governments told polluting steel mills that if they shut voluntarily now they would be allowed to reopen later
5271573 but under this superficial reason there is a deeper economic root cause the biggest problem is transportation because everything has slowed down but also costs of production are going up margins are disappearing and cash is tight
5271574 the olympics has not been a very normal period so data from july are not representative of what economic performance will be in the fourth quarter
5271575 people throughout the world see new zealand as a green untouched and beautiful country this is what our two largest industries tourism and food production are in large part built upon
5271576 we have a natural advantage over other countries in the world in this regard and we can and should continue to use it as a point of differentiation because consumers are increasingly making their purchasing decisions based on environmental factors
5271577 ive been involved in coastal research and coastal management in tasmania now for 30 years working both on shore birds and sea birds and in the 30 years that ive been involved in ive seen at a state level average a loss of 50 per cent of the numbers of birds and the mix of birds

5271580 the sea was red with these jellyfish and there was nothing we could do about it absolutely nothing
5271581 there is actually very little known about jellyfish despite the fact that jellyfish blooms may be increasing because of overfishing and climate change which could have huge socio economic impacts
5271582 in 20 years time we may be looking at jellyfish and chips rather than fish and chips

5271594 all the participants in our mba and executive education programmes have been or are practitioners with at least four years of business experience
5271595 what they expect from a business school is faculty that can give structure to their own experiences this works best when you have staff with formal or academic knowledge of management thinking along with enough experience to be able to explain the complexity of putting all of this into practice

5271637 five thousand children die every day of diarrhoea because of a lack of hygiene and sanitation and nobody really cares
5271638 we have to understand that what we eat and the products we buy have an immediate implication for the availability of the worlds water resources
5271639 surprisingly 20 million europeans need access to safe and affordable sanitation
5271640 now weve stopped discussing whether or not there has been climate change or where or who has been contributing to it

5271642 a wonderful blend of psychology philosophy and politics this book is an essential reader for anyone wishing to work intelligently and sensitively with clients it covers an impressive breadth of scholarship from psychoanalysis to phenomenology to systemic and social constructivist theories and just when you think youve read it all before theres something to be learned waiting round the corner
5271643 i particularly enjoyed lyndsey moons own chapter about the construction of emotion catherine butler and angela byrnes readable and lucid account of their work in hiv and sexual health services and peter hegartys writing on queer methodologies
5271644 he was integral he played a key role he was trusted by others members of this site so much so that he stored horrific images of child abuse on their behalf
5271645 he described the 250 000 child abuse images as his collection he was prepared to share that with acquaintances he found on his forum
5271646 this site would have existed without him but it would not have been operating as effectively
5271647 he was essentially the librarian for a myriad of images that were distributed to like minded individuals both in this country and elsewhere
5271648 this was an extremely sensitive and highly complex investigation requiring excellent teamwork between cleveland police the child exploitation online protection ceop centre and the metropolitan police service along with other police forces in the uk
5271649 i hope this result acts as a deterrent and sends out a clear warning that activity such as this will not be tolerated
5271650 this website whilst appearing to operate on the margins of legality was clearly a front for the sinister sexual abuse of children and an image trading ground for paedophiles
5271651 there is a simple message for those individuals like thompson who think they can go to this website or indeed any space on the internet and discuss their sexual interest in children and share images

5271670 our findings show ssws lives are dominated by an unrelenting cycle of selling sex buying drugs and then using them
5271671 this suggests they are unlikely to be able to just stop working even if the risks of punishment are increased street sex markets and the ssws poor health are the product of complex and interrelated factors and if anything these approaches will make ssws wary of contact with the police and push the women underground making them more vulnerable to violence and difficult for support services to reach
5271672 our research indicates that improvement of drug services would reduce the need to score and use drugs which is likely to reduce time spent working as well as contact with drug dealers and other users if this was linked to addressing accommodation needs and supporting contact with children then the majority of pressures forcing the women back into the cycle would also be addressed

5271720 senta siccome abito lontano potrebbe farmi ascoltare la differenza tra due impianti stereo
5271721 senta io stavo guardando una trasmissione sugli spiriti allimprovviso il televisore si e spento da solo pensa ci sia una relazione
5271722 senti un po tu al telefono ce uno che non riesce a svitare il tappo del sale

5271726 senta il mio frigorifero e guasto perde acqua trovo tutti gli indumenti bagnati
5271727 the brewery can champion beer quality locally but as our cask ale brands spitfire and bishops finger are available nationally it is important that we use cask marque as part of our support package to ensure that our beer is always served in the best possible condition
5271728 we are also very keen to join in some of the current cask marque initiatives which include cask ale week planned for easter 2009 and to champion the distributor charter which covers the handling of beer in the supply chain
5271729 the enthusiasm for cask ale within the industry is now being reflected by the actions being taken by some of the key players and the investment being made in cellar management trading
5271730 minutes before the official announcement of pope benedicts election cardinal macharski points to the liberal reporters assembled in st
5271731 bring it i still help elect the popes around here last time i checked
5271732 macharski emboldened by the felicitous election of ratzinger jumps the gun and announces gaudium magnum annuntio urbi orbi et universo
5271733 i dont think anyone thinks that there is a migration happening
5271734 there doesnt seem to be a pickup in usage across any significant portion
5271735 i am very happy and feel honor for the governments appreciation by allocating such special budget for the climate changes mitigation and adaptation
5271736 they didnt have regulations on how you dispose of waste and all these things in those days
5271737 so they didnt build these mills with any of the environmental protections regulations today are tighter on uranium mills than probably any other chemical plant in world
5271738 the u s needs to have at least some degree of production to have security of supply
5271739 these are complex facilities and they require a lot of analysis on our part
5271740 but they also require a lot of design and preparation by the companies
5271741 if they take a look at technical protections built into this mill theyll realize virtually this thing is benign when it comes to environment
5271742 it is like stealing a part of the history of our country
5271743 we had hoped it would be a few more years before it got this far
5271744 the reintroduction of turkey oak and the re invasion of gall wasps into northern europe may simply represent restoration of a previous natural situation
5271745 inspiration and guidance for attempts to engage patients in creative activity
5271746 a practical introduction to a rapidly developing field the authors are keen to demystify the arts making them approachable for all and with so many practical and useful hints they have clearly succeeded
5271747 but it really didnt kind of get on the front burner until sometime within the last seven days
5271748 deadline must have been earlier than the decision than when we started to get serious about making the decision
5271749 in an irony sure to set blogger hearts beating giddily the film graces the cover of ews new fall preview issue
5271750 ew and warner bros share a parent company but they clearly do not share you know important information
5271751 its his grandparents so he should be happy about it but sometimes he focuses on the negative a little bit i tell him cmon its just basketball thats the way i look at it but my dad was a little negative i had to get in his face a little bit
5271752 i dont know all the rules i dont care it was something i wanted to do go to the olympics
5271753 people are going to hate you no matter what you do people hate kobe bryant and hes the best player in the world
5271754 i just want to be positive not focus on the negative stuff it doesnt get you anywhere
5271755 you know why i did it one reason is every summer i play in the summer league and all these guys in summer league are trying to get a job or are just starting on a team and are trying to prove something
5271756 and im not trying to prove anything i know im a good basketball player i know what i can do i know what my skills are i try to play within my game and within my skill set and the other reason is i want to have some fun summer league is not what i want i want to try something else and this is fun look im in beijing china with a once in a lifetime opportunity here
5271757 have to make a judgment in the next little while
5271758 most committees are functioning well and the government is advancing its agenda subject to some of the compromises youd expect in a minority parliament
5271759 i agree with the statement from the da district attorney that this is a horrendous crime
5271760 i cannot fathom what must have gone through your minds on two occasions i am granting you probation not because you deserve it but because i want your victims to be made whole
5271761 i am absolutely serious that you comply with every term of your probation
5271762 this is something ive really really wrestled with for over a year this is something where nobody wins i want them to be taxpayers and good citizens i hope they make it
5271763 its one thing to talk about what was spray painted
5271764 how is a smart young man not thinking over a two day period he was busting up churches and a cemetery its more than just not thinking
5271765 in the next week or so kids are getting ready to go back to school
5271766 what kind of message are you sending to kids and this is one of the worst ive ever seen that this is a probation case
5271767 give him that key to the penitentiary and let him hold it in his hand as opposed to locking him up and throwing it away
5271768 we think cap and trade is an important way to go
5271769 it fits in better with what other jurisdictions are doing and it guarantees emission reductions
5271770 this is an exploration of an area of emissions trading that could be included in a future program for us
5271771 if farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers in a better way and reduce those emissions that come off their field then were further ahead in terms of the total amount of greenhouse gases that are getting released from human operations
5271772 instead of opening up the soil by tilling it really actively where you get a lot of carbon released and get nitrous oxide released during that process if you keep it closed it keeps the carbon sequestered in the soil
5271773 by growing new trees youre taking carbon out of the air and youre putting it into the wood and sequestering it there
5271774 on a national scale we are 10 per cent of the problem with greenhouse gas emissions but we can be 20 per cent of the solution
5271775 and the pilots that are being identified here in ontario are also things that can be used at the national scale
5271776 society has to recognize farmers are willing to do this but we cant do it were not paid to assist
5271777 this is not a widespread please come on down and sign up routine yet
5271778 action to preserve the remaining areas of natural forest is needed urgently
5271779 around 700 thousand tonnes per year each year tasmanias forests are absorbing 24 of the entire states carbon emissions
5271780 tasmanian forests are a massive contributor to the fight against climate change
5271781 responsible stewardship of land and sustainable management of our forest resources particularly reforestation and reduced deforestation has provided a sink reducing greenhouse gas emissions
5271782 under the kyoto protocol clear felling mature native forests to grow new trees doesnt count as land clearing so carbon emitted from that activity is left out of the ledger the result is that forestry gets a dream run in official emissions statistics
5271783 tasmanias state forests will absorb 31 million tonnes more atmospheric carbon than it will release making them a net sink of carbon over the next 43 years
5271784 given the undeniable urgency in confronting climate change for the forestry industry to continue to emit massive amounts of greenhouse gasses and deplete natures stores of carbon is a climate crime for tasmania to have to wait 22 years for positive carbon benefits from our forests is a major failure of our responsibility to future generations and a very poor example to set for the rest of the world
5271785 tropical forests move more carbon in and out of the atmosphere than any other ecosystem
5271786 there is preliminary evidence that wood smoke could be worse for peoples health than car exhaust pollution
5271787 forestry tasmania roll out the biomass plant idea every year when they are under public pressure about burning in the forests
5271788 cant believe i shaved for this i mean what am i even doing here who cares about bob saget
5271789 i dont know you know i guess a few other people turned it down its always how i look at it
5271790 no i really like her shes a really good girlfriend
5271791 you should try that i think thatd be good for you
5271792 wir gehen davon aus dass die vermeintlich betroffenen eine verschleppung nur vorget uscht haben
5271793 as far as airlines are concerned you are no longer just a passenger
5271794 never before have so many people in germany traveled on db trains in the first half of the year and never before were more goods transported by rail
5271795 it appears to be part of a labor dispute according to waldron who did not know at 7 15 a m how many of the 27 bus lines operating in the south suburban divisions area would be affected or how exactly they would be affected
5271796 were trying to maintain as much service as possible waldron said
5271797 this is an illegal job action it does not appear to be sanctioned by the union
5271798 passion and prejudice properly aroused and directed do about as well as principle and reason in a party contest

5271808 any investment strategy that allocates significant portions of the portfolio to volatile or illiquid assets
5271809 the whole point of the new policy is to make it far less likely that congress will have to engineer a bailout
5271810 i am still motivated i am more motivated than i am under pressure but being under pressure is motivation in itself
5271811 i cant wait to get the players back to get this machine back going again for me this is a true departure

5271824 non penserai che mi sottragga alle regole che io stesso ho dettato
5271825 s ti sei messa ad ascoltare quello che le tue compagne di scuola dicevano di te
5271826 spiare la gente grazie alla magia significa spiarla comunque tu hai giudicato male la tua amica ella una debole ma ti vuole bene era soltanto intimorita dallet della sua compagna e ha detto cose in cui non credeva affatto
5271827 allora ho rovinato tutto stai forse dicendomi che se non fosse stato per lincantesimo avremmo potuto continuare ad essere amiche amiche per la pelle forse anche per tutta la vita e che ora invece ci non pi possibile
5271828 non ti ho spiegato pi di una volta che nessuno mai pu conoscere quello che il futuro gli riserva

5271844 kalau tiba tiba masuk namanya kader instan kelemahan kader instan tidak ada kejelasan apakah orang itu paham visi misi parpol dan ada kecenderungan mereka akan habis manis sepah dibuang oleh parpol
5271845 bayangkan saja keuntungan yang didapat parpol dengan tokoh yang selama ini dipahami terlibat atau dekat dengan aktivitas pelanggaran hak asasi manusia ham di masa lalu kemudian mereka misalnya merekrut para aktivis ham atau korban pelanggaran ham
5271846 cuma memang jangan hanya karena mencari keuntungan seperti uang atau popularitas lalu para kader instan itu dapat melenggang begitu saja dengan enaknya dan mendapat posisi strategis yang seharusnya menjadi hak para kader lama dan loyal yang sudah terbukti pengabdian mereka pada parpol
5271847 jadi selain tidak perlu banyak mekanismenya harus diatur agar tidak memicu kecemburuan kader yang ada

5271922 the us led economic downturn shows no sign of causing a recession in it spending
5271923 in subsequent years we will see reduced growth but the fundamentals remain strong emerging regions replacement of obsolete systems and some technology shifts are driving growth
5271924 organisations are switching from company owned hardware and software assets to per use service based models this will impact the industry in various ways
5271925 the projected shift to cloud computing for example will result in dramatic growth in it products in some areas and in significant reductions in other areas in general assets will be utilised with greater efficiency and we are assuming that the overall effect on market growth will be neutral we also recognise that there is considerable upside potential for higher growth
5271926 most companies updated their software systems during the period 1997 through 2001 as a result we are in the middle of an upgrade cycle that should extend past the end of this decade
5271927 however the replacement of systems does not automatically equate to new software market growth software as a service saas cloud computing service oriented architecture soa web 2 0 and open source software are causing huge changes to the software market many of these factors are impacting market growth as enterprises replace assets with per use services
5271928 legacy telecom services have a dampening effect on sector growth and therefore on the overall it market
5271929 the dominant size of the telecom services market guarantees that even with the forecast for relatively slow growth it will still comprise over 44 per cent of the it market in five years time
5271930 spending in it services is being supported by two main factors
5271931 businesses are investing in improvements to internal processes aimed at reducing costs while often maintaining some of the prior interest in innovation the second factor is that globalisation allows it services providers to mitigate the risk of weakening demand by operating in more markets
5271932 the market growth outside of the us and the effects of the weak dollar are major factors in growth in us dollar terms in addition to regional shifts a strong shift to mobile pcs is occurring the higher prices of these products result in increasing revenue per unit and a boost to the overall market

5271936 beneath the yellow awning of planet aids nonprofit store in harvard square the idea on display is as attractive as the mannequins the 7 you pay for someones castaway corduroys might help fund an aid project in zambia or angola that outgrown overcoat you donate could end up sheltering a refugee from the rain planet aids model of economic idealism found such a welcome in massachusetts that suburban holliston became the groups headquarters in the united states and rural williamstown became the site for a campus that launches volunteers all over the world in 2000 three years after the organization began scattering its clothes collection containers across new england planet aid brought in more than 3 6 million in clothes and cash much of it from people who had been told in a brochure that half of their used clothes would be donated to the needy in africa but almost none of the clothes donated to planet aid are given away and only about 6 percent of the money the group raises is spent on charity a planet aid official acknowledged a week ago
5271937 local charity planet aid collected 58 million pounds of clothing in one year alone and you may be surprised about where your donation is really going youve seen them around the delaware valley clothing donation bins to help the poor but youre about to find out these boxes are not all the same because one local organization may be profiting off those clothes you donate what they want to do is make themselves look like a non profit goodwills mark boyd told us and the secret ways that group is using the money to fund unorthodox schools have led some to call them a cult

5271959 i cant go out tonight im training for a marathon in january in west allis
5271960 we are excited about being involved with such a unique event
5271961 we think the instep icebreaker will be very appealing to runners who are looking for a winter marathon but do not want to travel to a warm climate to find one we hope to do this on an annual basis
5271962 on an average saturday or sunday in the winter months our track can easily hold 100 200 runners at one time so having 100 participants for an indoor marathon would be no problem
5271963 we have heard from our regular users that this event would not only be very interesting but very fun as well
5271964 the track is as old as the building which opened in 1992 and could definitely use some improvements
5271965 we would be able to help an important piece of our facility by holding this very important event runners who use this track regularly would see benefits immediately that would only improve their running experience
5271966 my guess is that these were staged events much like boxing matches where they invited some of the best runners in the world and pitted them against some of the top local runners
5271967 you go into these small towns in pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothings replaced them and its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations

5272033 coach stuck with me he didnt forget about me that means a lot to me
5272034 some people say theyll believe in you and they dont mean it but coach proved when he says something he means it and so i knew he was being genuine when he said he wanted to help me get on the field
5272035 the more i have learned about this position the more fun it has become
5272036 it was real frustrating but the decisions i made were my fault
5272037 im not going to blame it on anybody else i want to put that behind me and move forward and play this year and help my team out
5272038 ive matured a lot sitting out and looking back on things and the decisions i could have made
5272039 he learned how important football was to him by sitting out last year
5272040 he now understands how his teammates and his coaches are counting on him he wants to contribute not just for himself but for the team as well
5272041 hes under the radar until theres a deep crossing route and he makes a big hit people who play us know who eric thatcher is i know the media likes to talk about some of our other guys but hes a leader back there
5272042 at that position there is so much that goes into it from a mental standpoint hes the quarterback of the defense he makes the calls get us lined up we need a guy like that back there and were very fortunate to have him
5272043 its a position where you dont always get the accolades because youre not going to have 120 tackles or 15 sacks
5272044 youre going to be the guy who lines us up and gets us in the right position because of that we make the right play someone else might get the tackle or get the pick but it wouldnt happen without him
5272045 before i probably did take my health a little bit for granted
5272046 im a lot more determined now to do all the little things that the coaches are always emphasizing the need to warm up properly because that helps prevent injuries i definitely take that to heart and get my full stretching in
5272047 hes probably had as good a camp as any of the backup defensive linemen weve got probably four guys competing but if i was honest and said whos probably made the most plays its probably been chas
5272048 coming in as a walk on the other guys were awesome but you felt like you had something to prove
5272049 most people look at walk ons as if theyre not on the same caliber so that was definitely motivation to come in and prove myself and say hey i can play on this level i want to get a scholarship its a respect thing but until theyre able to i dont need one
5272050 hes about as quick as any player we have on the team and he uses it in the right ways
5272051 right now ive got him starting on possibly two special teams on opening day
5272052 from a special teams standpoint hes been the most exciting guy of the freshmen he just wants to play
5272053 i was excited to hear that they were all coming down to pitt were all working hard toward the same goal
5272054 when you come in you have a lot of questions about camp and school
5272055 more guys keep coming i try to help out with all of them when i got myself ineligible thats a hard hole to get out of i got my grades together and im trying to show them the importance of that

5272077 president musharraf has made some recent trips around the globe to arab muslim states and some non arab muslim states to talk about a couple of issues one how they can band together to address the issue of the israeli palestinian conflict and two also how to in some way address the divide within the muslim community between the sunni and shia

5272080 hoewel de grote internetproviders hun dns servers nu vrijwel allemaal gepatcht hebben zien we dat mailservers dat vaak nog niet zijn we weten niet of het daarbij om mailservers van providers gaat of van bedrijven
5272081 we weten alleen dat we veel namen van mailservers tegenkomen in onze lijst van ongepatchte servers
5272082 beheerders hebben zich in eerste instantie gericht op het patchen van machines die als offici le dedicated nameserver bekend staan vaak is men vergeten dat er op de mailservers ook nog nameserversoftware staat beheerders van kleinere bedrijfsnetwerken hebben vaker wat minder kennis van dns of weten gewoon niet dat er op hun mailserver ook een nameserverproces draait bovendien zijn er binnen een netwerk meestal meer mailservers dan nameservers aanwezig de nameservers maken de meeste queries dus die worden als eerste gepatched de mailservers pas later
5272083 vaak zijn mailservers wat beter beveiligd omdat er vertrouwelijker informatie op staat of men ze beter wil beschermen tegen misbruik door spammers het is daardoor complexer om te zorgen dat die beveiliging wordt aangepast naar aanleiding van het lek
5272084 binnen kleine bedrijfsnetwerken wordt het dns verkeer meestal door heel goedkope routertjes verzorgd die kunnen vaak niet eens gepatcht worden die gebruikers moeten dus eigenlijk een nieuwe router aanschaffen maar meestal zijn ze van geen gevaar bewust ik denk overigens niet dat criminelen hen als doelwit kiezen omdat er relatief weinig te halen valt
5272085 toch is het aantal onveilige queries gedaald van achttien naar veertien procent dat komt doordat een aantal grote dns servers inmiddels gepatcht zijn
5272086 als we de adressen van nameservers waarvan we op basis van patronen vermoeden dat ze gebruikt worden voor onderzoek of monitoring van domeinnamen buiten beschouwing laten dan houden we iets minder dan 5 van de queries over die nog kwetsbaar zijn

5272108 but habitual active forgiveness the kind of forgiveness that elevates your life and makes you a healthier happier more effective person does not happen by accident by revelation or by the mere passage of time forgiveness comes from a decision you made long ago to live in a certain way you dont have to be religious indeed many religious people cant forgive anything you dont have to be a goody goody indeed many goody goodies are secretly nasty you dont have to become a saint take special vows undergo therapy or get on some medication all you really have to do is look for the best in others and in yourself when you try to do that you set forgiveness in motion

5272114 im a city boy in the big cities theyve set it up so you can go to a park and be in a miniature countryside but in the countryside they dont have any patches of big city so i get very homesick another reason i like the city better than the country is that in they city everything is geared to working and in the country everything is geared to relaxation i like working better than relaxing in the city even the trees in the parks work hard because the number of people they have to make oxygen for is staggering if you lived in canada you might have a million trees making oxygen for you alone so each of those trees isnt working that hard whereas a tree in a treepot in times square has to make oxygen for a million people in new york you really do have to hustle and the trees know this too just look at them the other day on 57th street i was walking and i was looking at the new sloping solow building across the street and i walked straight into a treepot i was embarassed because there was no way at all to carry it off i just fell on top of this tree on west 57th because i wasnt ready for it to be there

5272193 the soldiers told us they had an order from putin leave or be killed
5272194 they said putin has given us an order that everyone must be either shot or forced to leave they told us we should ask the americans for help now because they would kill us if we stayed

5272206 including estimated transmission and substation costs paralana will cost 190 200 million to develop initially to 7 5 megawatt mw capacity and then to the second stage 30 mw capacity
5272207 the third and fourth stages will take it to national grid status supplying base load power of 260 mw and 520 mw
5272208 our assessment is that at every one of these supply capacity points paralana is commercially viable
5272209 although wind power costs about 2 million per megawatt of installed capacity for an equivalent 30 mw project it would typically only operate for about a third of the time producing about 87 gigawatt hours annually
5272210 so for a comparable annual output of 250 gigawatt hours the wind farm would need to be almost three times the capacity of paralana
5272211 when you also factor in the off grid pricing of power from a 30 mw paralana plant let alone the larger capacity stages and its 24 7 consistency in comparison to other renewable energy sources the overall project economics and advantages over wind are compelling
5272212 the comparison confirms what petratherm has promoted all along that paralana will not only produce a constant and reliable source of base load power but do so on a favourable cost and performance profile

5272227 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5272228 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5272229 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5272230 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up

5272306 people have actually missed the point that advertising because its actively trying to play us is actually probably the smartest industry of them all
5272307 no one has ever really wrestled advertising to the ground and it is the sort of thing that sort of permeates every minute of our waking lives
5272308 we knew dentons approach would be irreverent and also steeped in the desire to want to know more it wasnt going to be a flip show it was going to be rigorous
5272309 that split second when the malls intentionally confusing layout makes our eyes glaze and our jaws slacken the moment when we forget what we came for and become impulse buyers
5272310 i found myself in the supermarket and i went to buy the cheaper dishwashing liquid and found my hand moving over to the more expensive because the advertising told me thats the one to get as i wrote in the pitch document if you can be persuaded to buy the orange dishwashing liquid when the green one is cheaper what else can you be persuaded to do how do you even know your thoughts are your own
5272311 are surrounded by advertising but dont think about it that much and this show helps people think in a way thats funny and interesting
5272312 it would suit an edgy public broadcaster or a risk taking private broadcaster
5272313 when he first came to me he said i have no idea what im doing
5272314 ok this girl just stole your grandmas purse and shoved her in front of a moving car
5272315 this is the form of pr for the 21st century ceo to be media savvy

5272322 were tired of being a foreign car in our own country
5272323 the decline in print has been so pervasive that its taking the online stuff with it
5272324 were in a transition period as an industry and were going to see some down quarters as papers deal with that
5272325 the ones who have done well are the ones who have most aggressively diversified
5272326 this is significant because its establishing a separate independent business from our print product
5272327 at what point did they lose the ground to pkr
5272328 what this study actually proves is that search moves the branding needle for cpg
5272329 its really good news for brand marketers because there are really strong efficiencies they can find in search marketing the price for this branding value is zero because its being served anyway and marketers pay for clicks not number of impressions at this point the cost per click in these categories is very low
5272330 the implication is if youre present your awareness goes up and if youre not present your awareness goes down
5272331 it seems like from the results that the punishment for a challenger brand is very high for not being in the paid listings so they really should be there
5272332 and its also cost effective for them its probably cheaper than a tv campaign and its much easier to raise the brand perception
5272333 i think our brands have such a strong presence that its nice to be in the first position but i dont think we have to be there
5272334 im not convinced its worth paying the extra money or the extra effort to get there yet
5272335 its kind of like the klondike before the gold rush
5272336 if all branding clients go and do search for branding it will change
5272337 yes its growing and we have helped drive a lot of growth
5272338 you just cant put forward concepts and knowledge relationships like flinging hash
5272339 no other structure is in the same league as the common sense basis of cyc weve found its knowledge framework to be flexible enough for any customer context
5272340 in the cyc project weve been working to develop the knowledge representations and reasoning capabilities for intelligent software that collaborates with its users although researchers have been using some of the results for a few years now the recent growth of the semantic web presented both a need and opportunity to have a dramatically greater impact opencyc is the language that can tie the disparate parts of the semantic web together
5272341 by representing and sharing knowledge in the same language semantic web applications can be enormously more powerful
5272342 common semantic vocabularies are the missing link for the semantic web blogs cover an incredible range of subjects so meaning based content integration using the huge opencyc ontology can provide an amazing user experience for bloggers and other content authors
5272343 if someone is interested in a product information about components of that product may be relevant
5272344 if someone is interested in a product component they may be interested in a companys competitors who also rely on that component
5272345 we think that a rich ontology like opencyc can enable us to extend iglue with new information or to validate the existing data using logical inference and it has the potential to provide a base for a common semantic infrastructure as a sort of entity yellow pages

5272405 el sector forestoindustrial produce el 60 por ciento del pbi con solo el 10 por ciento del rea forestada de misiones creo que se merece m s de un mes al a o de ser todos forestales deber amos tener el sentimiento forestal que en los ltimos tiempos no se lo marketinea muy bien y se a mal informado un poco sobre lo que significa el pino dejando de lado el importante factor de sustituci n que tiene la madera implantada en reemplazo del bosque nativo que tanto tenemos que cuidar y proteger pero en un esquema sustentable
5272406 el sector forestoindutria esta pasando por una dif cil situaci n porque tenemos todos los mercados externos e inclusive internos cerrados con una falta de rentabilidad de nuestros productos

5272415 youve got to keep going its a tough place to manage there were a couple of times during the game i would have liked to take some regulars out and give them a break but well just take the day off today and make sure we got this win
5272416 for our club the way we came out swinging against beckett today was a big lift for us
5272417 i think we thought today was going to be one of those games where one or two runs was going to be tough to come by
5272418 sometimes you can get away with catching a little too much of the plate but today they were just bad pitches
5272419 im pulling so hard for mac because of the way he plays shortstop

5272421 this a small protest but its intended as symbolic we are standing here outside trinity the main entrance is closed were saying if fees are re introduced it will have the effect of closing college to many people especially from lower income families re introducing fees would be a drastic retrograde step we need to encourage more people into third level and to expand education as a central part of a knowledge economy

5272470 the pervasive insecurity in the niger delta area is a concern of all nigerians and we in the construction and civil engineering industry are specially affected as providers of infrastructure we remain the first victims of the crisis situation despite the fact that we build roads bridges and do civil construction and provide massive employment for the people and therefore should be seen in positive light as developers of the area we are being seen by the indigenes as exploiters consequently our men materials and machines have been greatly endangered in the course of our lawful enterprises in the area the threat to the companies and our staff in the area is having reverberating effects on the nation and therefore we cannot fold our hands and watch helplessly
5272471 the companies in the industry are finding it very difficult to operate and they are now threatening to turn down our members en mass into labour market as a consequence of the insecurity nigeria is once again sliding back to a pariah nation where international community ban their citizens from coming to nigeria
5272472 they are only trying to save their face from the grave error committed against our defenceless civilian settlement why is it that the military could not display the weapons they allegedly recovered from the area after the operation
5272473 what our people laboured over the years have been destroyed due to the inability of the military to pin point their target in civilised democracies soldiers are known to have owned up to their mistakes in the course of their operations but not in nigeria where obvious errors are often justified
5272474 when you stop somebody from getting what he use to get illegally it is either he gets at you or paint you black before the world that is exactly what the agee people are doing if you go to the village you will be sorry for the people go to the area and see things yourself the activities of the bunkerers have contaminated the waters so much that the people do not get good drinking water the earlier the people know the havoc the militant caused the better for the region all our men have blocked all exits for the bunkerers
5272475 when we came out in 2005 during the banking consolidation exercise our offer to raise n50 billion was the highest the market ever witnessed we met the target and even surpassed it those who came after us came with offers that were much bigger we believe we will not only realise this target but it may well be the new benchmark for the industry
5272476 the market is swinging and it is not a permanent feature it is common with most capital markets across the world and very soon it will be heading upwards
5272477 it has been consistent with payment of dividend and bonus share offer in recent times this should serve as good attraction for investors to patronise the offer
5272478 union bank is the only one with quoted subsidiary in the industry union homes a subsidiary of union bank is very strong it is a quoted company and can stand against some of the banks in the industry today the bank has 10 subsidiaries and they would be quoted very soon each of them is expected to subscribe to the offer how then can the offer fail
5272479 apart from that the full year result of the bank is going to be good even the projections in the offer prospectus are very attractive
5272480 real investors are not worried about development in the market at the moment it is the speculators that are shouting they are not investors
5272481 it brings out the beauty of the market and it is a healthy development that is to be expected in any market
5272482 investors particularly institutional investors have great confidence putting their money there a lot of nigerians are repatriating money home and are quite confident investing in the old generation banks and as for the rights offer it will be fully subscribed because the bank has been very consistent in dividend and bonus offer in recent years
5272483 the 10 per cent equity peg did not impress the foreign investors we needed them not basically for the money but for them to share their expertise with us there is however no circular on this yet but it was discussed at the bankers committee

5272560 n r boligen falder i pris svinder v rdien af den formue man bringer ind i den ogs derimod skader det ikke at have en langvarig g ld og i stedet placere pengene et sted hvor de bliver mere v rd over tid
5272561 der er ingen regel om at man partout skal have nedbragt g lden i sin bolig n r man g r p pension s hvorfor ikke finde alternative opsparingsformer som er mere attraktive
5272562 anl gger man et rationelt og langsigtet perspektiv kan man f mere ud af pengene ved for eksempel at placere dem i en ratepension det betyder dog at pengene kan v re bundet i en periode p typisk 10 r og det skal man v re parat til
5272563 n r noget er faldet meget og det er r varerne s kan der godt komme et par dage med prisstigninger men det er ikke s dan at r varerne nu skal stige igen flere af r varerne ligger stadig p meget h je niveauer selvom de er korrigeret noget tilbage i den seneste tid

5272592 theres no question we did the right thing in holding the opening ceremony to air in prime time on nbc that night
5272593 the excitement that built out of word of mouth that the opening ceremony was the most spectacular thing that people had seen that china had wanted to make a statement and they made a statement and people wanted to see that
5272594 i think whats been great weve been able to bottle that excitement since the opening ceremony and i think the team has captured that in every day since
5272595 the suspect returned a little while later and was again involved in an exchange of words with nilanthan and his friends which resulted in the victim being injured

5272597 given that the suspect returned approximately 30 minutes after the exchange of words at the traffic lights it is highly likely he lives locally

5272600 as of june nominal home prices declined 10 7 percent from a year ago given our home price expectations for the remainder of this year we expect 2 7 million preforeclosure and foreclosure filings in 2008 up nearly 50 percent from 2007
5272601 nominal home price declines have stabilized in the 10 to 11 percent range for several months however given the surge in inflation real inflation adjusted home prices are still declining at a faster rate between april and june home price declines were flat falling by an average of 10 8 percent but real home price declines accelerated from 15 3 percent in april to 16 8 percent in june
5272602 thirty seven states are experiencing nominal price declines which is the same as last month california and nevada are clearly experiencing the largest drops declining at more than 20 percent arizona and florida decreased more than 17 percent from a year ago several new england and midwestern states have declined between 9 and 13 percent during the last year
5272603 although nominal prices have moderated overall the moderation is occurring for a few select states with the exception of florida the top five and bottom five states in terms of price appreciation continue to experience larger declines and smaller increases relative to the last few months the more interesting price trends are occurring in the middle of the appreciation distribution where several formerly moderately depreciating states such as new york colorado louisiana and the district of columbia are experiencing fairly slower albeit still negative declines

5272614 i felt more fear in american cities i can walk down the streets of tel aviv at night without a problem but i of course have the knowledge of which places not to go at night just like any other city in america
5272615 my mother was also against it for the obvious reasons
5272616 it was just one of those childhood dreams i never grew out of everybody was against it because nobody thinks of jewish people as police officers
5272617 i always wanted to be a cop but my wife sharona was against it
5272618 but i convinced her it took her two years she thinks its a dangerous job i was sick of my other job because there was no room to grow i wanted a future
5272619 the next class is going to have 30 or 40
5272620 if you give a jewish guy a ticket its very hard
5272621 and then people talk they could make your life miserable
5272622 i just feel like a regular person i dont stop and think my yarmulke is on
5272623 i think girls actually like it because how many jewish cops are there
5272624 a burger at mcdonalds costs two or three bucks but at a kosher place its 8
5272625 even today in the gym my yarmulke fell off when i was doing push ups
5272626 the nypd is the most diverse city agency and the most diverse police department in america
5272627 the community had been raising red flags for months and sometimes years
5272628 its a mystery to us how you can have the number of inspectors that were practically living in that building and have that level of disaster
5272629 it exposed an area that the city had never looked at this comprehensively when we looked at it we found a lot of areas that could be improved
5272630 this wasnt any building this was a public spectacle this was a high rise toxic vacant building that was under deconstruction
5272631 we cannot afford to have anyone else lose their life
5272632 if that means its going to take a little bit longer to take the building down then its going to take a little bit longer
5272633 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5272634 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5272635 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5272636 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5272637 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5272638 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5272639 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5272640 sure he couldnt cover against his old team the colts but theyre the super bowl champs how could we expect him to
5272641 what i found out is that combustion generated particles contain environmentally persistent free radicals
5272642 when the radicals are associated with particles they can apparently exist indefinitely
5272643 the implication is you can have the same environmentally related diseases by exposure to airborne fine particles that you can get from cigarettes
5272644 these airborne free radicals are of interest but i am not sure we are at a point where our scalpel is sharp enough to dissect the individual components of air pollution that cause problems for people
5272645 there are studies that show that modifying free radicals can alter the course of disease
5272646 but the implications of this what it means to clinics what it means to doctors what it means to regulators i think we are a long way from pulling that together
5272647 i think good ceos manage to find company customer and shareholder attitudes that fit their budgets you have to balance the need to run and grow your company with things that are nice to have in a tough environment like we have now the frills go first you quickly focus on say 4 of the 8 things you thought you needed to grow and the nice to haves go out the window its a matter of balance and perspective but from time to time things get out of whack
5272648 the ability of corporate leaders to absorb new information about markets technological change and other economic events make quick decisions to capitalize on such information and manage associated risks is a strength of the us economy that should not be underrated or lightly discarded
5272649 ideally however decisions that address short term issues should not sacrifice the achievement of longer term goals

5272655 i just get the sense with obama that he has a clear set priorities in his own mind that have nothing to do with ups and downs of the campaign
5272656 he doesnt need someone who is young but its got to be someone who is not part of the baby boom partisan of the 1990s
5272657 the vice presidential pick is always more about telling voters what kind of a potential president the nominee will be and its even more important for obama than it has been for past nominees
5272658 obamas central challenge in this election is to make a certain group of voters comfortable with him in terms of who he is as it relates to being able to do the job and the vice presidential pick along with the convention and debates stands as one of the three tent foundation events in the general to connect with voters about who he is
5272659 more confrontational about that issue than and more adamant about discriminating against gay people
5272660 look theres no way this is going to happen but ive been getting this weird feeling that he might pick her
5272661 if they were trying to fool us to have us rule her out completely to maximize the this be the way that they do it
5272662 that shes not particularly interested in this at all and has really moved on
5272663 wallace collins has previously received 4 000 in donations from this secretive organization that took money from injured workers without their knowledge
5272664 collins has used this money for his own political purposes and should return that money at once
5272665 all candidates and those who had received funds from the working oklahomans alliance
5272666 well if were going to ask wallace collins to give back that money then we should ask all of them
5272667 because everyone who got that money should give it back
5272668 i doubt very seriously if any of these candidates or elected officials knew where that money came from
5272669 in campaigns you dont look gift horses in the mouth
5272670 i havent seen any proof that theyve done anything wrong or illegal
5272671 and i would certainly want to see proof of wrongdoing if thats what happened if mr warren can prove theyve done something illegal then id certainly like to know but just because he doesnt agree with them that doesnt mean theyve done anything illegal
5272672 they are registered with the state ethics commission so i dont know how that makes them secretive
5272673 was an attempt to divert attention away from the gops own problems
5272674 it seems strange ironic maybe that a group that has their own ethical problems such as disgraced former speaker lance cargill who is said to be under an ethics investigation for shaking down lobbyists would point the finger at someone else roger warren should worry about the beam in his own eye before he worries about the splinter in mine

5272689 a higher tax on higher earners is mere pseudo radicalism what would be more radical as well as correct is an attack upon the very functions that the rich perform because the fact is that many of the super rich should be technically redundant do we really need high paid chief executives when co operatively run businesses might be just as efficient wouldnt a simplification of the legal system especially relating to tax be an efficient way to reduce demand for high paid lawyers and shouldnt we point out that hedge fund managers earn poor returns for their clients for doing nothing very special

5272691 are we supposed to be supporting this book and presenting this as fact in the freshman discussions
5272692 oh no this is intended to get them thinking and to encourage them to discuss and listen to opinions that they might not agree with
5272693 never that size but always branches falling down its sad that this is probably what it takes to have somebody come up there and cut all that down
5272694 they should at least close that off and put some kind of netting or have some kind of something a barricade or something

5272711 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
5272712 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
5272713 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5272714 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5272715 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5272716 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5272717 your point seems to be that they are basically the same car and then you try to explain it away by saying that you meant that they were both f body cars
5272718 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5272719 and we have safely placed senator mccain in a cone of silence
5272720 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared

5272730 you have to assume that when a fortune 500 company like grainger makes a big deal about changing a font color on their website there is a very good reason behind it this seemingly insignificant change can probably represent hundreds of thousands of dollars in extra sales

5272739 we have a responsibility to do something to show the world that tibet needs to be free
5272740 we really appreciate his support and the risk and trouble he took
5272741 he was able to show the spotlight about what is going on in tibet right now and how the tibetans are suffering
5272742 all these pressures are somewhat creating a perfect storm in which students and parents are aggressively seeking financial assistance from colleges and from anywhere else they can go
5272743 weve actually seen a small downtick in the number of students who requested aid
5272744 we have a lot of families who are experiencing financial difficulties
5272745 the younger kids are focusing more on their planning and problem solving while they are actually playing the game while adolescents are focusing less on their planning and strategizing and more on the here and now
5272746 the single best predictor of their skills is how much they had played video games in the past and how much they played now those were better predictors of surgical skills than years of training and number of surgeries performed
5272747 so the first question you might ask your surgeon is how many of these surgeries have you done and the second question is are you a gamer

5272761 the world is confronting supply constraints for energy and mineral resources while there are enough resources to satisfy the worlds appetite the industry has not moved quickly enough to meet the growth in demand

5272770 currently there are no specific in vitro diagnostic tests for preeclampsia even though the disease threatens the lives of thousands of women and their babies and places a significant burden on healthcare systems worldwide
5272771 we expect that once we complete our development program these tests will help improve the outcomes of at risk pregnancies it is a powerful example of our commitment to provide clinical laboratories with the tools that improve patient health and reduce the cost of care our expectations for diagnostic testing related to maternal and fetal well being leads us to believe that buying out our u s royalty obligation will create substantial value for our shareholders
5272772 this is an important step forward in realizing our goal to become fully reporting and to list on the over the counter bulletin board
5272773 we are also completing software advertising program and hardware network called avti media we believe that this program has the potential to provide the largest revenue stream to the company our goal is to promote advertising sales with our existing vending routes which we operate and as add ons to the vending machines we sell to independent operators avt will sell advertising which will run on systems within the avti media network both avt systems and non avt vending systems equipped with avt based pcs running the advertising software will be capable of being part of the national and soon international avti media network

5272776 it is very pleasing and slightly surreal to be able to announce record half year results when the financial markets are in turmoil
5272777 there was a strong performance from all divisions and a positive investment result which is an achievement given the buffeting many investments even the short dated and highly rate ones we favour have had in the recent market turmoil
5272778 yes we have investments in asset backed bonds and the like but we have not had a single bond default and we are getting much better returns to maturity than in recent years
5272779 hiscox has reported a strong first half despite weak investment returns
5272780 we are in the middle of the hurricane season and the financial markets remain challenging but a strong start to the year bodes well for the full year

5272787 behind the world food crisis is a global freshwater crisis expected to rapidly worsen as climate change impacts intensify
5272788 irrigation fed agriculture provides 45 per cent of the worlds food supplies and without it we could not feed our planets population of six billion people
5272789 millions of people depend on freshwater fisheries as a major food source
5272790 freshwater food stocks can provide up to 80 per cent of dietary protein for the 60 million people of the mekong basin for example and thats just one river
5272791 freshwater systems are home to around 40 per cent of all the species on earth
5272792 and our impact is shown by the fact that we are losing these species faster than any other
5272793 a global treaty for co operatively managing rivers and lakes that cross or form borders is still languishing in limbo more than a decade after being approved by a clear majority in the united nations
5272794 water management for human needs alone is damaging the natural systems we all depend on
5272795 maintaining the health of freshwater ecosystems has to become one of the major aims of freshwater management generally
5272796 we are also concerned that the world continues to mainly discuss adaption to climate change rather than doing it
5272797 we have been doing it all over the world and we have found that that improving the health of freshwater ecosystems now makes a great contribution to improving their resilience to climate impacts in the future
5272798 it is ironic that currently it is not foresight and planning but major natural disasters that lead to significant efforts to repair damaged rivers and wetlands foresight and planning now will reduce the risk and damage from future extreme weather events while having many economic social and environmental benefits
5272799 even this tiny proportion however would be enough for humans to live on earth if the water cycle was properly functioning and if we managed our water use wisely
5272800 ive been involved in coastal research and coastal management in tasmania now for 30 years working both on shore birds and sea birds and in the 30 years that ive been involved in ive seen at a state level average a loss of 50 per cent of the numbers of birds and the mix of birds
5272801 there are birds that i remember seeing in the 80s that i havent seen now for 20 years
5272802 its goal is to bring together as much information as possible and to make it accessible to researchers of all kinds and members of the public
5272803 so that it becomes a lot easier to answer questions about what really is in this country what its doing what its chances are under climate change and other threats and to really help us all to manage our environment somewhat better
5272804 its a job to bring together information from the natural history collections from field workers of various kinds and from members of the public to place their observations into a context that can be used for modelling and understanding a bit more about the real requirements of each of those species
5272805 weve only named probably about 10 to 20 per cent of australian insects
5272806 so most insects we dont know yet and the ones we do know we only have a limited amount of information
5272807 so really we have no idea about their distribution or where they are likely to live or what their biology is
5272808 what that means is we dont have the information we need that might help conserve them
5272809 strict data basing it would take about a thousand person years
5272810 but there is a lot of work that has to go into the collection first in terms of updating the curation to make it available
5272811 so what we really need to do is thinking about ways of automating the entire process to expedite things
5272812 one of the earliest things well be offering is at least the beginnings of a system which allows users to enter the name of a species and find a summary view of what we know about their distribution from those data sets that are already connected
5272813 probably thumbnail images and links to literature resources and web pages that we know of for those species
5272814 they are going to be some of the early results from this
5272815 the longer terms goals are probably actually for the atlas to be much more invisible and for it to be providing some of the kind of tools that plug into other websites that are bringing information to the public
5272816 the purpose of the atlas isnt simply to exist in its own right as a final place for information but to take it to the places where it can be used and made most beneficial
5272817 theres some conflict due to whats been described as a feeding frenzy for renewable energy in the desert
5272818 if youre going to destroy conservation and pristine lands then yeah how green is it in the end
5272819 were really at the forefront of a discussion that is certainly going to be repeated throughout the state of california and nationally as well
5272820 all of us are going to face this challenge of where to build transmission corridors in a way that is going to impact the local communities as little as possible
5272821 its interesting that we consider some of these areas as pristine and we dont want to put turbines or solar or transmission lines there but they are suitable for housing development theres sort of an irony there
5272822 tapi jangan keliru isinya bukan untuk membela islam sebaliknya ia ingin melemahkannya

5272827 sudah tiba saatnya sekarang untuk melakukan studi kritis terhadap teks al quran sebagaimana telah kita lakukan terhadap kitab suci yahudi yang berbahasa ibrani arami dan kitab suci kristen yang berbahasa yunani the time has surely come to subject the text of the kuran to the same criticism as that to which we subject the hebrew and aramaic of the jewish bible and the greek of the christian scriptures

5272830 ms rices visit to tbilisi demonstrates the accumulation of years of mixed messages may have made the american warnings fall on deaf ears the united states took a series of steps that emboldened georgia sending advisers to build up the georgian military including an exercise last month with more than 1 000 american troops pressing hard to bring georgia into the nato orbit and loudly proclaiming its support for georgias territorial integrity in the battle with russia over georgias separatist enclaves

5272834 nalaman ko na lang na may sakit na pala siya
5272835 may organization sa manila na tumutulong sa mga half japanese para maging dual citizen
5272836 di ba may law na ngayon na pag half japanese ka puwede ka maging dual citizen kung ia acknowledge ka ng tatay mo
5272837 while i was talking to the father he started crying
5272838 a friend of mine died a week ago dahil sa liver cancer nakita ko kung papaano siya nahihirapan sa lagay na yun ginagamot pa siya e alam mo yun ang papa ko hindi man lang siya pinagbibigyan ng chance to fight for his life
5272839 bakit mo gusto maging dual citizen hindi ka ba masaya sa pagiging pinay na lang
5272840 pero kalahati po e hapon talaga ako tsaka mas madali sa akin na makakapunta sa japan para madalaw ko man lang siya father makasama ko man lang siya
5272841 nagkaroon nga po ng problema na may drug something na i dont know
5272842 masama daw loob mo sa stepmother mo dahil hindi pinaalam agad na may liver cancer ang papa mo
5272843 then pinagalitan ako ng dad ko noong nagkita kami sabi niya na huwag ko awayin siya ang nagsabi na huwag sabihin sa amin dahil ayaw niyang mag aalala kami pero noong in explain ng dad ko e naintindihan ko na
5272844 meron silang doctor pero its not enough mga ganoon grabing case e sa hospital talaga
5272845 pagkakita po namin e hindi na kami nakapagsalita ng kapatid ko
5272846 nagmakaawa po kami sabi ko na kahit lumuhod ako gusto ko lang siya mahawakan tapos sobrang higpit ng jailguard nagso sorry na sa amin
5272847 kaya lang bilang anak na nangungulila sa amang na may sakit e gusto ko siyempre na mahawakan man lang ang papa ko wala talaga e as in nakatingin lang kami tapos hindi ko ma imagine na ganoon na itsura niya every time na nagsasalita siya e namimilipit siya sa sakit yung feeling na ganoon na parang hindi mo mahawakan gusto mong i comfort ang sakit sobra sabi niya huwag na kayo umiyak kahit namimilipit sa sakit pinipilit pa rin niya ngumiti
5272848 ang sabi po kasi hopeless na daw po ang magagawa na daw po is maghintay at mapahaba ng kaunti wala na daw talagang cure kaya ayaw siyang tanggapin kumalat na daw yung cancer cells
5272849 kahit sino naman kahit sabihin na pinaghandaan nila never naman magiging ready para mawala ang isang tao na mahal mo kahit hindi ko kasama dad ko e sobrang mahal ko siya
5272850 papa mahal na mahal kita sana magawan pa ng paraan na mahawakan man lang kita alam ko mahirap ang nararanasan mo maging strong ka po mahal na mahal ka namin

5272858 the question is how to get this growth so that it is not a problem
5272859 you have to ask is this a need or a demand
5272860 of course this is not just a discussion for spain it happens in california it happens in portugal in greece in italy what we are trying to introduce is a new message with the tradition that there is a message of cost a message of responsibility and a message of scarcity included in how we plan
5272861 its the height of hypocrisy for zaragoza to be having an expo that touts water sustainability
5272862 zaragoza is one of the biggest culprits in what ails spain too many farmers using too much irrigated land

5272865 they took me into a filthy bathroom full of water and dirt they made me take off my clothes and squat and they threw my clothes in this slush and made me put them back on
5272866 he said you are sinful and you are going to burn in hell i told him i was sorry i was very submissive i had given up i felt hopeless
5272867 i was lucky i met other women in that prison who dont have the connections i did

5272871 leroy gave voice to a topic that we are very uncomfortable with death and dying
5272872 my cancer had a face and a heart and a smile
5272873 he looked to be about 5 which meant he was probably 10 malnutrition will do that
5272874 he was lying on his back and had thrown his arm up over his head his fingers had gotten tangled in my boot laces as i looked in his eyes i saw the light go out and he died a strangers face my face was the last thing he saw and all i could do was shake my foot to free my laces from his fingers and then move on to catch up to my team it was five years before i could tell that story
5272875 while his craft was to illustrate television stories with the right picture his gift was using words to touch people
5272876 would eloquently tell the subscribers to the daily nightline e mail why the broadcast on that particular night mattered
5272877 a daily reminder that none of us walks this road alone what could be better than that
5272878 its not just that he gives people an opportunity to open up and they do so many of them do on his blog but that he is the voice for people
5272879 that sometimes they feel they dont need to speak that hes speaking the words that theyre feeling

5272885 it a very viral thing once people find the website they tell other friends and that is the way it should be people helping other community members get healthy
5272886 we have found that people who are on a team are losing 25 percent more weight than the people who are not on a team that is a significant difference

5272900 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5272901 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5272902 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5272903 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5272904 writing is simply a form of speaking which endures after it is uttered the soul of our words

5272909 we want to increase credit in the sme sector and for this a dedicated equity fund had been proposed which would be in place in the next six to eight months

5272911 we have not yet decided whether we will make it a sectoral fund or general fund by september we hope to decide on the structure the fund will not be less than 100 million
5272912 im sorry but i prefer to eat alone because i wish to have some quiet time

5272915 our goal is again to qualify quickly and directly as group winners and also that we improve our play with an eye on 2010
5272916 to be perfectly honest i wouldnt entertain a move to glasgow
5272917 im happy to be playing outside scotland at the minute especially with the kind of press thats been going about for rangers and celtic im quite happy to be away from it
5272918 i read the papers and i watch the television and there has been some bad press for rangers recently

5272924 responsible homeowners have worked hard to build equity in their homes through no fault of their own an increasing number of homeowners have suddenly discovered their helocs frozen and access to cash from their home equity denied
5272925 the rex agreement is a debt free alternative that can replace the frozen heloc and give homeowners a large lump sum cash advance to use anyway they wish without having to pay interest or make monthly payments
5272926 this isnt the last homeowners will hear about frozen helocs or perhaps worse as lenders continue to tighten guidelines and products disappear in the aftermath of the worst meltdown in mortgage history
5272927 the good news is that homeowners dont have to go it alone at rex amp co were working hard to bring our fresh approach and innovative debt free alternative for helocs home loans and reverse mortgages to millions of responsible homeowners nationwide

5272941 if he puts a couple more wins on the board quickly i think youll start hearing whispers
5272942 it was a grind mentally and physically to bear down and make pitches
5272943 i just felt deep down inside that if i could keep them from scoring any more runs wed have a chance to come back and win it
5272944 it was definitely a nice victory a nice win for us
5272945 i am quite surprised yes i have never been able to work out why gordon brown wants to be prime minister he clearly has wanted this job with a passion for the last 10 years and probably since he was in short trousers
5272946 but now that hes to use a cricketing metaphor at the crease its not clear why he wanted to do the job what he wanted to achieve
5272947 and i am surprised at the sort of rudderless and indecisive nature of his premiership but thats the cause of the collapse in labours popularity they dont appear to know where theyre going anymore
5272948 i am determined that the conservative party will be seen as the party of development and i think there is an international development agenda which is very similar to the agenda that david cameron and iain duncan smith have been pursuing in the uk and we have made progress

5272958 id like people to hand one to the driver of every bus they get on saying they object to this policy whether they push a buggy or not
5272959 we dont want to behave in a hostile way to drivers or hold anyone up but we just want to make it clear how many people their customers think this is outrageous its so intimidating waiting for a bus and not knowing whether youll be allowed on
5272960 what are you supposed to do if youve got a six week old baby who cant go in a foldable buggy its not possible to carry your baby all the time
5272961 it can be very hard for mothers with young children to get around as it is the last thing lothian buses should be doing is alienating so many passengers
5272962 most parents are happy to get off a bus if a wheelchair users needs the space
5272963 i would definitely support this i think handing out cards is a good way for people to show lothian buses what they think

5272969 russias use of this weapon is not only deadly to civilians but also an insult to international efforts to avoid a global humanitarian disaster of the kind caused by landmines

5272977 during our first quarter for fiscal 2009 we reported tremendous revenue and earnings growth as such we reaffirm our fiscal 2009 guidance of revenue between 100 125 million and earnings of 7 9 million before one time expenses in addition we project revenue between 150 180 million for fiscal 2010 with earnings of 11 15 million before one time expenses
5272978 it is important to consider when reviewing our financial results on a quarterly basis that the infrastructure construction business in india is seasonal and the months between june and august represent our monsoon season as such revenues for our fiscal first and second quarters will be substantially lower than our fiscal third and fourth quarters each year for example the predecessor companies reported pro forma revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 of approximately 3 3 million yet for the full fiscal year of 2008 the combined companies reported revenue of over 30 million

5272984 confirmed that mccain did not hear or see any of the broadcast
5272985 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because that what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5272986 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5272987 i thought about running away from my problems but i talked to coach fulmer about it and he said thats not what a man does
5272988 he said a man faces his problems and suffers the consequences i never really wanted to leave and go back to oklahoma i wanted to stay here i love this state i love the people around here
5272989 i tried to turn a negative into a positive i tried to do something that people dont expect others to do after going through something like that and that is bouncing back from it
5272990 it was a situation where we knew he was an 18 year old kid at the time

5272992 i tell them do this and watch out for this
5272993 i just try to coach them up on what ive already been through i could have easily been back home and not doing anything so i try to keep their heads on straight
5272994 gerald is going to be the guy who is the future of this group

5273010 the talent that i have the drive that i have the want to succeed the excitement about the sport im fortunate to have every quality that i have and i wouldnt trade it in
5273011 and over the past years i havent seen him change
5273012 you cant put it in words the level of achievement that he has done here is phenomenal and in my opinion well never ever see it again i just dont think that can ever be emulated or beaten in an age where the sport is so competitive and so close
5273013 he made the pressure putt in the u s open he won the tour de france and he knocked out the best fighter in the world in the 16th round with an uppercut he did absolutely everything sport is supposed to be and he did it with a smile on his face

5273028 let me repeat liu xiang will not withdraw unless the pain is unbearable
5273029 everyone expected liu to do well as well as he did four years ago
5273030 we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be
5273031 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be
5273032 after liu xiangs injury i wont bother coming back to the birds nest for more
5273033 and will encourage him to come back to the track
5273034 i think they will be disappointed but they will understand

5273038 weve not had much rain this month and i think we are looking at a pretty minimal chance of rain over the next couple of days
5273039 beginning about wednesday there is a chance of showers throughout the weekend but these are scattered of the hit and miss variety so not everyone will get the rain
5273040 last year we had a very dry start to august but we had 1 38 inches of rain most of which fell late in the month
5273041 the corn is drying down and its already produced what its going to the soybeans are in a holding pattern and thats only because its been 80 degrees rather than 100
5273042 but the ponds and streams are low peoples yards are dying
5273043 the low lying areas like murfreesboro and outlying areas may break the record
5273044 we are in a dry spell which is affecting many lawns and gardens but well get some rain at some point
5273045 before i would just lay there and look at the walls i would never look outside all i needed was a little help and i got it
5273046 its a well intentioned way to try to provide some needed help
5273047 i would say that is just completely ridiculous tenncare remains a very generous benefit package what were saying is we have a lot of people to take care theres a lot of needs
5273048 my doctors and nurses kept me going all those years
5273049 some with muscular dystrophy didnt make it to their 20s here i am 30 and made it through college and they hold that against me
5273050 theres not enough money to go around to get everything done there needs to be oversight the problem is that you have this large bureaucracy that sets standards its not very good at the individual patient level of evaluating this

5273064 vergonheso uma garota viajar pelo egito sem um acompanhante masculino ou ent o chegar em casa depois que escurece de acordo com a cultura de algumas comunidades sair de casa sozinha torna a mulher desqualificada para o casamento estar desacompanhada tamb m preocupa os pais dos crist os j que muitas meninas crist s foram seq estradas ou seduzidas por mu ulmanos
5273065 quando estava na universidade tinha um desejo tremendo de servir ao senhor mas meu pai n o gostava que eu ficasse indo s vilas visitando as mulheres
5273066 muitas jovens t m medo de viajar por causa dos riscos

5273070 theres not a lot of lighthearted news coming out of iraq these days but we recently came across a ton of music videos that the soldiers there are apparently making in their free time
5273071 not a team player trying to be a hero and blah blah blah
5273072 its in use in many places i can think of lots of other enforcement tools that are at least as aggressive as that
5273073 id listen to both sides but im open minded about that if it would help improve traffic safety compliance with the law be cost efficient to the taxpayer we ought to think about it

5273075 hillarys health care plan forces everyone to buy insurance even if you cant afford it and you pay a penalty if you dont

5273088 i feel sorry for new jersey here they had an opportunity to step up to the plate and they opted not to
5273089 i would have thought new jersey would have had a little more brass than that
5273090 to the extent home prices stabilize faster or oil continues to weaken these provide further upside to the baseline view
5273091 it was interesting karma comes around honestly what i thought of it was that karmas a bitch with a red dress
5273092 joe silva was telling me to lose some weight and gain some muscle he said i need the ufc look
5273093 we know how to beat anderson silva the only way to beat him is to push the pace go forward all the time you cant let him get confident and comfortable in the centre of the octagon you have to push the pace for five minutes every round if i do that i can catch him ill take care of him
5273094 i would fight any one of the ufc lightweights but the problem is that i will never put my foot in the octagon after they ufc tried to be funny i would rather have bleeding hemorrhoids than fight for the ufc the japanese mma audience is the best in the world they make magic i would rather have one true japanese mma supporter than one million fake mainstream supporters that will turn their back on you as soon as you lose a fight i dont care about things that are mainstream
5273095 i think that shot pretty much changed the whole dynamic of the fight i sure would like to know what would have happened if it hadnt landed once that right hand landed it was like i was fighting half blind or pretty much blind at that point it was all pretty much downhill from there i just tried to come back and mount some type of offense unfortunately i was never able to mount anything that significant after getting rocked with a shot like that and not being able to see youre more in survival mode
5273096 and i told them the same thing and they laughed
5273097 scully is making the same point everyone else is making
5273098 he says the stats indicate you are having success hitting behind ramirez tell me that isnt the case
5273099 listen im so tired of talking about this stuff it diminishes my whole career and all the hard work i take it as an insult im 40 you dont get better when you are 40
5273100 you guys write about things happening in a weeks time thats why we dont like you baseball is a six month game what did i hit last year without manny how do you explain that whats my career average what will i be hitting at the end of this season everyone says im hitting now because some guy says so on tv
5273101 i think good ceos manage to find company customer and shareholder attitudes that fit their budgets you have to balance the need to run and grow your company with things that are nice to have in a tough environment like we have now the frills go first you quickly focus on say 4 of the 8 things you thought you needed to grow and the nice to haves go out the window its a matter of balance and perspective but from time to time things get out of whack
5273102 the ability of corporate leaders to absorb new information about markets technological change and other economic events make quick decisions to capitalize on such information and manage associated risks is a strength of the us economy that should not be underrated or lightly discarded
5273103 ideally however decisions that address short term issues should not sacrifice the achievement of longer term goals
5273104 we will be requiring about n70 billion to provide textbooks in the four core subjects and i wish to appeal to government at all levels to come to terms with this reality
5273105 the situation is grave and not very encouraging when one understands that the new curriculum requires a rich resourceful environment to flourish
5273106 additional sources of funds must be explored if we are to cope with the huge costs
5273107 we have about 600 000 teachers in the basic education sub sector at the moment but this is inadequate if we are to address the problems associated with high teacher pupil ratio in the urban centres
5273108 we are probably one of the first teaching hospitals in nigeria to have a department of medical informatics and medical informatics is all about the use of information technology in medicine
5273109 we are lucky to have someone who is on part time with us and he has masters in that area so knowledgeable and well skilled certified by microsoft cisco and the rest of them and he has been doing well to develop it facilities here
5273110 once you bring your laptop here you can browse the internet anywhere within the hospital premises but we are also using it for the practice of medicine this is because the issue of telemedicine is gradually catching on in nigeria
5273111 our challenge is funding we have a lot of ideas proposals to develop but there is no money the state government tells you they are handicapped and you cant increase hospital bill because most people in ebonyi state are indigent
5273112 we want our children to be educated and not be like us without education
5273113 but because there is no school for them to attend they have joined us in fishing the world is changing so we want a better future for our children
5273114 from isobodono to amassoma the nearest town to us is one hour by water transportation and more than 30 minutes by foot
5273115 the people of the community have had to walk for more than 30 minutes through narrow paths in the mangrove forest to get to amassoma for medical care and other social needs
5273116 let us be realistic and call a spade a spade
5273117 how can one as ya ndakolo allege say that the rdp is constructing the school when it is not the case he and his team are just busy with political tactics they want to get rid of me from the school
5273118 i leave my personal things at home including political issues
5273119 i just went there to clear the air because those leaders of the opposition parties especially the rdp are spreading lies and rumours among the people and are misleading the people for nothing
5273120 chinese dont consider opposition parties they are doing it because of swapo
5273121 the second draft is now coming in from jim and warner bros is pretty excited about it they came up with a couple of names for directors so now we just need johnny to look at the list it all begins and ends with johnny hes got to be happy with the script and he gave his notes so well see what happens next

5273144 we looked up and it looked like lots of confetti falling out of the sky
5273145 a twin engined plane then came toward us falling all the time it was going to hit us or could have gone onto the housing estate
5273146 but i think the pilot must have realised what was going to happen because the plane then banked very very sharply like they do in those acrobatic displays
5273147 it the aircraft had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry it was approximately two miles from the runway
5273148 we believe it had been cleared to land by coventry airport air traffic control when it was in collision with a smaller single engine light aircraft which was also hoping to land at coventry
5273149 we are conducting a joint investigation with the air accidents investigation branch and warwickshire fire and rescue service to try to find out what has happened
5273150 this was a tragic incident a family member can never be replaced and it is always painful when civilians particularly women and children are involved
5273151 while it is unclear exactly what caused their death an investigation is underway what is clear is that taliban fighters were in the area and showed a total disregard for the presence of civilians near them
5273152 the taliban use tactics in which they cause civilian life to be at risk they have no regard for the afghan people and support for the taliban in helmand is reducing
5273153 a result of an imminent insurgent attack from a position where they would have known women and children were present
5273154 isaac didnt read music but you couldnt believe a guy could sit at a piano and come up with the sounds he did
5273155 when people talk about the memphis sound that was isaac

5273157 we were really looking for blogs that know their state well
5273158 it helps us have a larger audience and a very specific audience in a lot of cases
5273159 but it really didnt kind of get on the front burner until sometime within the last seven days

5273163 the zimbabwean issue is far from resolved and so the continent as a whole has a responsibility to continue to engage with us in finding solutions
5273164 part of it is actually a process of trying to unlock the deadlocks that have emerged in the negotiations
5273165 we hope a deal can be finalised in the fullness of time
5273166 unless tsvangirai signs on the dotted line the crisis continues not only simply because the billions of foreign aid does not become available but also because he does represent a significant majority of the zimbabwean population
5273167 parliament will have to be convened sooner rather than later but i cannot say when that is the presidents prerogative he will decide its almost five months since they were elected

5273176 hull city achieving premier league status is an enormous story for us
5273177 there will be more media interest in hull city than ever before but we have put down a marker that our coverage will be better and more comprehensive than you can get anywhere else
5273178 weve set out to give the fans a complete service in the paper and on the web
5273179 the only disappointment was that technical problems prevented us sending out mobile sportflashes recording the tigers historic first premier league goal and the winning strike
5273180 subscribers can look forward to receiving this service for subsequent games
5273181 remains confident that antitrust issues will not prevent or delay a transaction
5273182 why do you sit there looking like an envelope without any address on it
5273183 if he can combine the creativity hleb showed with a double figure goal tally by the end of the season it will be money well spent
5273184 since arsenal have an injury crisis now but weve pulled out results in 2 consecutive games dont you think youre somewhat rong about arsenal
5273185 ego nees to get a witch doctor from back home to put a spell on all our players that they stay healthy
5273186 i said if he plays well we will cheer him but if he is poor he will get jeered whats wrong with that
5273187 tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
5273188 now i understand perfectly why stalin hitler mao et al
5273189 the true hypocrite is the one who ceases to perceive his deception the one who lies with sincerity
5273190 the true hypocrite is the one who ceases to perceive his deception the one who lies with sincerity
5273191 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing
5273192 political films regulation will be relaxed to allow factual and documentary portrayal of political events but will still exclude slanted political films
5273193 the more things change the more they stay the same
5273194 the goal is to provide guaranteed throughput for high priority data while at the same time reducing the need for additional network resources and minimizing cost
5273195 is not welcome in the city and if recruiters choose to stay they do so as uninvited and unwelcome intruders
5273196 i believe in the code pink cause the marines dont belong here they shouldnt have come here and they should leave
5273197 my husbands business is right upstairs and this protesting is bordering on harassment
5273198 most of the people around here think theyre a joke
5273199 theres a line between protesting and harassing and that concerns me
5273200 it looks like we are showing favoritism we have to respect the other side and not abuse their rights this is not good policy
5273201 this isnt a game its mass murder theres a sickness of silence of people not speaking out against the war we have to do this
5273202 we are confronted with an organization that can spend billions of dollars on propaganda
5273203 this is not okinawa here were involved in a naked act of aggression if we can provide a space for ordinary people to express themselves against this kind of barbarity then we should be doing it
5273204 this is a slap in the face to all brave service men and women and their families
5273205 the first amendment gives the city of berkeley the right to be idiotic but from now on they should do it with their own money
5273206 if the city cant show respect for the marines that have fought bled and died for their freedom berkeley should not be receiving special taxpayer funded handouts
5273207 we understand things are different there but some people just dont get it this is a part of the military machine that gives them the right to do what they do but what they are doing is extreme
5273208 to actually put something into law that encourages the disruption of a federal office is ridiculous they are not going to kick a federal office out of its rightful place there and this is not going to discourage those young patriots who want to be marines
5273209 if recruiters choose to stay they do so as uninvited and unwelcome guests
5273210 i have asked our legislative council service to prepare the
5273211 the bill proposes levying a one percent excise tax on the purchase of tvs video games and video game equipment and would create the leave no child inside fund to receive those revenues
5273212 the goals of the bill are to improve the academic performances of our kids to promote a more healthy lifestyle and to provide our children with outdoor learning experiences using our state parks and public lands as classrooms
5273213 ho pensato che se proprio devo andare allinferno tanto vale andarci in grande stile
5273214 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
5273215 ho pensato che se proprio devo andare allinferno tanto vale andarci in grande stile
5273216 vuoi che canti per te canter tutta la notte se ci terr via i cattivi sogni
5273217 the clinton inc war room has no boundaries whatsoever and they will use the full force and power of the federal government against individuals who are not supporting what they want to do think 700 fbi files
5273218 i can think of parallels in wartime but i have trouble coming up with a precedent in our peacetime history for such broad and centralized control over a sector of the economy is the public really ready for this
5273219 are anxious and willing to receive guidance from the clinton administration on how to time and shape their news coverage
5273220 biographies analysis of credibility in the media and known relationships with congresspeople
5273221 these documents paint a disturbing picture of how hillary clinton and the clinton administration approached health care reform secrecy smears and the misuse of government computers to track private and political information on citizens
5273222 there are millions more documents that the library has yet to release the clintons continue to play games and pretend they have nothing to do with this delay the clintons should get out of the way and authorize the release of these records now
5273223 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
5273224 now you want to win and saying it doesnt make it so
5273225 it would be nice to think that after eight years of economic disaster after eight years of bungled foreign policy of being engaged in a war that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged that cost us a trillion dollars and thousands of lives that people would say lets toss the bums out toss the bums out were starting from scratch were starting over this is not working
5273226 so i understand why a lot of folks are saying this should just happen why are we having to run all these television commercials why do we have to raise all this money just read the papers these are the knuckleheads who have been in charge throw em out but american politics arent that simple
5273227 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical they tune out and they start saying to themselves a plague on both your houses they are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information for good reason theyve seen how promises havent been kept
5273228 they always laugh that if they wound up being the nominees of their party it would be the most civilized election in american history and theyre afraid theyd put the voters to sleep because they like and respect each other
5273229 the de facto world standard regardless of what any other parties say
5273230 transatlantic economic integration though important in itself is not the end
5273231 economic integration must and will lead to political integration since an integrated market requires common institutions producing common rules to govern it
5273232 the aim of this roadmap and framework would be to remove barriers to trade and investment across the atlantic and to reduce regulatory compliance costs
5273233 the roadmap and framework will necessarily oblige legislative and regulatory authorities in both europe and the united states to take into consideration from the outset the impact their acts may have on transatlantic economic relations and to ensure that their respective governmental bodies involved have the necessary budgetary and organizational resources to work closely with each other
5273234 a political body to oversee and accelerate government to government integration between the european union and the united states of america
5273235 in removing barriers to trade and investment and in easing regulatory burdens
5273236 every newborn baby in australia represents a potent source of greenhouse gas emissions for an average of 80 years not simply by breathing but by the profligate consumption of resources typical of our society
5273237 far from showering financial booty on new mothers and rewarding greenhouse unfriendly behaviour a baby levy in the form of a carbon tax should apply in line with the polluter pays principle
5273238 i think self important professors with silly ideas should have to pay carbon tax for all the hot air they create
5273239 theres masses of evidence to say that child rich families have much lower resource consumption per head than other styles of households
5273240 one must wonder why population control is spoken of today only in whispers
5273241 it is vital that uk sport gets that money now or elite programmes will be cut in the run up to london 2012 and that makes no sense
5273242 it was pretty swollen he will be out for two or three weeks
5273243 i came back to the uk and got wheeled off the plane felt a bit like elizabeth taylor got an mri scan this morning and am now sitting up in bed with my left foot like a dead fish
5273244 following an injury received while attending last weeks international aids conference in mexico annie lennox underwent spinal surgery to release an impinged nerve
5273245 the surgery went as planned and annie is now recuperating at home annie would like to send her thanks and appreciation to all who have sent their well wishes in the past few days
5273246 but it really didnt kind of get on the front burner until sometime within the last seven days
5273247 deadline must have been earlier than the decision than when we started to get serious about making the decision
5273248 in an irony sure to set blogger hearts beating giddily the film graces the cover of ews new fall preview issue

5273266 the suspect returned a little while later and was again involved in an exchange of words with nilanthan and his friends which resulted in the victim being injured
5273267 we have now spoken to several witnesses and built up a good description of the suspect
5273268 given that the suspect returned approximately 30 minutes after the exchange of words at the traffic lights it is highly likely he lives locally
5273269 the taxi driver has not come forward yet and it is vitally important we hear from him

5273273 the building is under renovation however we had no other place to go there is no electricity here no potable water no food we have no beds to sleep on most of us are in despair we are really lost
5273274 we need to resume normal childhood activities for children and to ensure that protection mechanisms and health standards are in place for them
5273275 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
5273276 the situation is grave and calls for urgent and critical engagement of all parties
5273277 we must step up our efforts to ensure that all emergency funds and supplies made available are utilised immediately and effectively to save human lives and put a stop to the epidemic
5273278 the first year of university is a period of major transition to a new way of thinking and working with new experiences responsibilities and stresses
5273279 a member of my family who has since passed away had gone to florida headquarters for the national enquirer sat in a room
5273280 i sort of thought about it and i said yeah can i ask how her energy plan compares to the other candidates energy plans
5273281 because i dont know how familiar she is with their plans
5273282 the top one was planned specifically for a college student
5273283 it said college student in brackets and then the question
5273284 as a young person im worried about the long term effects of global warming how does your plan combat climate change
5273285 this is not acceptable campaign process moving forward weve taken steps to ensure that it never happens again
5273286 i dont know whether hillary knew what my question was going to be but it seemed like she knew to call on me because there were so many people and i was the only college student in that area
5273287 on this occasion a member of our staff did discuss a possible question about senator clintons energy plan at a forum this is not standard policy and will not be repeated again
5273288 i heard another man talking about the question he asked and he said that the campaign had asked him to ask that question
5273289 i wonder what you propose to do to create jobs for the middle class person such as here in newton where we lost maytag
5273290 im not under any real obligation to do that and i havent talked to the campaign anymore
5273291 if what i do is come and just be totally truthful then thats all anyone can ask of me and thats all i can ask of myself so ill feel good with what ive done ill feel like ive done the right thing
5273292 most americans never felt bill clinton was honest and trustworthy even when he got elected in 1992 with only 43 percent of the vote
5273293 i think she has a lot to offer but i this experience makes me look at her campaign a little bit differently
5273294 the question and answer sessions especially in iowa are really important thats where the voters get to have like a real genuine conversation with this politician who could be representing them
5273295 its possible that all campaigns do these kind of tactics
5273296 personally i want to know that i have someone whos honest representing me
5273297 he asked me if i would ask sen clinton about ways she was going to confront the president on the war in iraq specifically war funding
5273298 i told him it was not a question i felt comfortable with
5273299 if iran continues its nuclear weapons programme we will attack it
5273300 other options are disappearing the sanctions are not effective there will be no alternative but to attack iran in order to stop the iranian nuclear programme
5273301 gentlemen if i could not find something to laugh about at times like these i fear i could go out of my mind
5273302 thank you for contacting peta about the peta kills animals billboard and the accompanying promotions for it peta cant afford billboards in times square so were grateful for the opportunity that this one provides to discuss the animal overpopulation crisis
5273303 we do not run a traditional shelter in fact we refer every healthy cute young animal we can to shelters
5273304 m ost of the animals we receive are broken beings for whom euthanasia is without a doubt the most humane option
5273305 afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views of public importance
5273306 weve never had live animals so i just figured this was some spam thing
5273307 its rough enough on us people standing out there in the cold so were definitely not using animals
5273308 but i also think these folks should lay off my wife
5273309 for the first time in my adult life i am proud of my country
5273310 the gop should i be the nominee i think can say whatever they want to say about me my track record
5273311 ive been in public life for 20 years i expect them to pore through everything that ive said every utterance every statement and to paint it in the most undesirable light possible thats what they do
5273312 but i do want to say this to the gop if they think that theyre going to try to make michelle an issue in this campaign they should be careful because that i find unacceptable
5273313 to try to distort or to play snippets of her remarks in ways that are unflattering to her i think is just low class and especially for people who purport to be promoters of family values who claim that they are protectors of the values and ideals and the decency of the american people to start attacking my wife in a political campaign i think is detestable
5273314 holds the key to reducing gasoline prices at home in the short term
5273315 increases its oil production by one million barrels per day
5273316 is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard
5273317 which recently made a major oil discovery almost in sight of rios beaches
5273318 ok and just blindly followd like a lot of mind numbed robots

5273322 the laws and constitution are designed to survive and remain in force in extraordinary times

5273325 the sand in the hourglass is running out we are at the last pinch of sand
5273326 israels conditions for a truce are not bearing fruit in the way that could lead to a ceasefire

5273358 little jamaica our country is blessed with some of the best if not the best talent you can find
5273359 youd have had to plant a seed long ago to get where we are today
5273360 we had a choice complain about the resources and do nothing or work with what we have
5273361 its a mindset were small and were poor but we believe in ourselves
5273362 wayward boys from poor families in jamaica music was a key part of their education
5273363 without the school there just wouldnt have been the blossoming of talent on the island in the key period of the 60s and 70s
5273364 when the jamaican music industry took off it was totally dependent on those who studied there
5273365 every voter in america liked obama a lot but the grinch who lived in the distant past did not
5273366 the evangelical church can provide no genuine help for those who suffer from aids if those involved do not first have their ethic of life firmly rooted in the word of god
5273367 accordingly we call on pastor rick warren to rescind his invitation to sen obama immediately
5273368 the millions of silent victims who have died because of the policies of leaders like sen obama demand a response from those who believe that life is a gift from god
5273369 it is clear rick warren would never have a racist or sexist speak at his church concerning any topic
5273370 in light of that fact why would he feature a speaker who supports violence against women and children
5273371 having sen barack obama speak on issues of social justice is like having a segregationist speak on civil rights mr obama supports partial birth abortion and has voted against bills prohibiting taxpayers paying for abortion it is hypocritical at best for him to speak out against the horror of aids on children and then support abortion which has killed 50 000 000 children in america alone
5273372 pastor rick warren who is one of the most influential evangelical leaders in the world should realize the terrible signal he is sending by inviting a speaker who tramples on the historic teachings of christianity and the bible
5273373 sen obamas policies represent the antithesis of biblical ethics and morality not to mention supreme american values
5273374 if pastor warren cannot find the courage to rescind his invitation to sen obama he must at least make clear through a public statement that the senators support of abortion stands in contradiction to what the bible teaches and what the christian church has historically taught on the sanctity of life
5273375 as those who have worked to defend preborn children from the horrors of abortion in america and who have stood uncompromisingly against the legalized slaughter of an estimated 50 million americans in the womb since 1973 we join with one voice in expressing our indignation and opposition to rick warrens welcoming of sen barack obama to his church
5273376 in the strongest possible terms we oppose rick warrens decision to ignore sen obamas clear pro death stance and invite him to saddleback church anyway if sen obama cannot defend the most helpless citizens in our country he has nothing to say to the aids crisis
5273377 the name of the seminar at which senator obama will be appearing is entitled we must work together no mr warren mr obama we will never work with those can support the murder of babies in the womb
5273378 rick warren can do us all a favor and keep his remarks and opinions to himself when you dont stand up against and condemn evil let alone say misrepresented facts about an evil regime you become an enabler and defender of evil plain and simple
5273379 rick warrens comments about syria are an insult and a slap on the face to every christian who ever lived under that regime or suffered from syrias evil dictatorship not only in syria but also the christian lebanese
5273380 rick warren needs to speak to some of the christians who fled syria because of the oppression of the syrian regime and are now here in america they can tell him about the syrian troops storming their christian schools when they were children and burning the schools because they were christians
5273381 he was shown open churches and worshiping people he was not shown a single muslim who converted to christianity he was shown people who are grandfathered in
5273382 if he would have seen a muslim convert the scene would be different and tragic he would have seen one of my kinsmen buried up to his waist in his burial cloth and then stoned to death killed for the sole crime of finding faith in jesus christ
5273383 that is not religious freedom and that is not tolerance that is religious genocide
5273384 to call syria a moderate peaceful country where christians and jews live peacefully protected by the regime is nothing more than a statement of his ignorance lack of intelligence and lack of grasp and understanding of the middle east conflict there are christians in syrian prisons now whose families do not know anything about them or if they are still alive or dead my neighbors son was kidnapped over 25 years ago and until today they do not know if he is dead or alive
5273385 hailed the religious coexistence tolerance and stability that the syrian society is enjoying due to the wise leadership of president al assad asserting that he will convey the true image about syria to the american people
5273386 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gases is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
5273387 climate modelers have been cheating for so long its almost become respectable
5273388 the earths atmosphere ocean dynamics is chaotic its evolution is sensitive to small perturbations in initial conditions this sensitivity limits our ability to predict the detailed evolution of weather inevitable errors and uncertainties in the starting conditions of a weather forecast amplify through the forecast as well as uncertainty in initial conditions such predictions are also degraded by errors and uncertainties in our ability to represent accurately the significant climate processes
5273389 a time when mankind began to build its first civilizations
5273390 there is good reason to believe that a warmer climate would have a similar effect on the health and welfare of our own far more advanced and adaptable civilization today
5273391 the general security situation in kilinochchi and mullaittivu districts remains volatile with ongoing
5273392 i wish i could fire shots to show my joy but unfortunately i cant do that
5273393 thank god hes resigned the country will do much better now its a victory for the people
5273394 the country was doing better economically but now the politicians wont be able to preserve the economy and things will get worse
5273395 im not very hopeful these politicians will again indulge in political bickering i dont think they will bring down prices
5273396 i will remain faithful to the nation and my countrymen and promise in the name of the people that i will remain faithful to the sovereign nation of nepal
5273397 we have to take this peace process to a logical conclusion and we have to restructure the state people have high hopes for us and we will not let the people down
5273398 we have had good discussions about stakes in the club and we feel that we cant afford to leave stakes of the bigger races stagnant who knows what may change with other races in time

5273799 they may be named unrighteous for they accept the course of the world without question and are unconscious of the barrier which hems them in in no sense can they be described as inhabiting the empty canal of revelation but it can happen that the gentiles which have not the law do the things of the law but revelation is from god it cannot be compelled to flow between the banks of an empty canal it can flow there but it also fashions for itself a new bed in which to run its course for it is not bound to the impress which it once had made but is free it is therefore a mistake to abide by the description of the gentiles as asleep in unrighteousness and unbelief they can become godfearers without it being evident to others they can become his elect for faith is always in itself hidden and unrecognized among the gentiles there is moreoever a shattering and disturbing awe which those who inhabit the empty canal neither perceive or understand but god beholds it and knows its meaning
5273800 if such characters from the dostoevskian underground are now the gentiles then the church should note pauls warning that it is sometimes the gentiles who show the work of the law written in their hearts who are preferred over the righteous inhabitants of synagogue or church even if all they own is the honesty of their experience of alienation

5273847 by coming up with a sophisticated sponsoring concept and by closely working with construction companies and the venus organizing company
5273848 we have managed to create a concept for venus gay area that makes it possible and above all also affordable for any gay studio to exhibit where the whole adult industry comes together in europe every year
5273849 in the past exhibitors with relatively small budgets literally got tucked away into sad little corners lost in the masses of booths oriented at the straight market
5273850 also the gay public was never specifically invited to venus before this year we have changed all that
5273851 even the smallest of budgets buys you a very attractive booth in a dedicated and specifically designed area of the fair along with a great advertising campaign thatll make sure the public will show up as well
5273852 the guys at otb video have been working diligently on getting this done for all of the fans that have complained over the years for a way to enjoy the show without having to search all over the huge fair with its hundreds of straight exhibitors
5273853 for the first time this year there will also be a strong advertising campaign aimed specifically at the gay public to make sure the companies exhibiting at gay area get the audience they deserve
5273854 the gay area is almost sold out now too only very few booth spaces and sponsorship slots are left so act fast if youd like to join us in berlin
5273855 its a perfect opportunity for u s labels that would like to present themselves to the huge european marketplace

5273898 when evening came the owner told his foreman call the workers and pay them their wages starting with those who were hired last and ending with those who were hired first 9 the men who had begun to work at five oclock were paid a silver coin each 10 so when the men who were the first to be hired came to be paid they thought they would get more but they too were given a silver coin each 11 they took their money and started grumbling against the employer 12 these men who were hired last worked onl y one hour they said while we put up with a whole days work in the hot sun yet you paid them the same as you paid them the same as you paid us

5274023 it seems like a lot of music today is so churned out and simple i like playing these festivals because its one thing all day and then here i come on and everyones like whoa then back to the grind
5274024 it sounds like a banjo but they sing with it and its the most fucking passionate emotional music ive ever heard in my life
5274025 i want to include that in my album because its so passionate like when you hear a korn song and its really going crazy these guys do it with a stringy banjo i want to bring that to kids here who are like what the fuck is this and open their minds up to something different
5274026 its no secret that i had my problems during my last few years in korn
5274027 there were drug issues and i just wasnt enjoying the music any more thats why im so excited about this album i poured everything i had into it and i think ive really connected with the fans which was one of the primary purposes for doing it hopefully it will inspire those who hear it i hope they feel the magic again the same kind of feeling that i now have
5274028 its great that everyone agreed that flush should be the albums first single
5274029 at a time when so many people are losing homes and jobs and making tough decisions about whether to fill a gas tank or pay health insurance city governments should avoid counting calories and dispatching garbage police
5274030 why are they still using rockets to go to space
5274031 first democrats failed on the radio airwaves with air america no one wanted to listen
5274032 conservative radio is a huge threat and political advantage for republicans and we have had to find a way to limit it second it looks like the republicans are going to have someone in the presidential race who has access to media in ways our folks dont want so we want to make sure the gop has no advantages going into 2008
5274033 with respect again to the you know the idea of the reconcilables and the irreconcilables this is something in which the iraqi government obviously has the lead it is something that they have sought to in some cases to reach out and i think again that any student of history recognizes that there is no military solution to a problem like that in iraq to the insurgency of iraq military action is necessary to help improve security for all the reasons that i stated in my remarks but it is not sufficient
5274034 climate change are greenhouse gas emissions from human activities contributing to a warming of the planet
5274035 if you think that by bombing and assassinating palestinian leaders you are preparing ground for new attacks on lebanon in the summer i am telling you that you are seriously wrong
5274036 if this year you repeat the same mistake of the last year the ocean of nations of the region will get angry and will uproot the zionist regime
5274037 so far it hasnt been a distraction because its been through a process
5274038 its a chance to listen to haroon lorgat about what the situation is so all the players a fully informed knowing that the board are then going to meet on tuesday and make a decision on whether were going or not
5274039 we want to listen to what haroon has to say the key being that if an england team is going there its got to be safe for them to go otherwise were not going to go
5274040 winning is a very good habit to have but credit should go to the players
5274041 we knew that if we picked up early wickets we could control the indian batting it wasnt easy but the wicket had a bit in it at the start
5274042 we cant sit back on this victory we need to continue to work hard and improve on a few minor things
5274043 we were not really good in the field today we missed a couple of chances and that is something you cannot afford to do against a quality opposition
5274044 overall im quite happy with the way we performed all the players are chipping in and that is the most important thing
5274045 i think there was something for the fast bowlers at the start in the morning and the sri lankan fast bowlers exploited those conditions nicely
5274046 they got the early breakthroughs and they kept the pressure
5274047 we have not been chasing well in the recent past but i think it was just the little grass on the wicket which did us in
5274048 we thought that with a 10 oclock start it wouldnt do much we had expected it to be tough in the first half hour but there seemed to be something in it right along
5274049 it got a little better to bat on later but munaf patel and zaheer khan were still able to get something out of it
5274050 they bowled really well given the circumstances overall it was quite good but we had too few runs to defend
5274051 sometimes its a good thing as you dont have too much time to dwell on this defeat you just get back to practice and get on with the game

5274064 changing seriously the atmosphere and situation in which we find ourselves in so im hoping that they can correct this very very quickly but these event s in the last 48 hours are not very encouraging if it continues this way i think there will be a need to seriously take a look at the whole situation are we talking to the correct people
5274065 we are hoping to see serious changes otherwise we will be entertaining doubts that we did not entertain before

5274067 truth is said to consist in the agreement of knowledge with the object according to this mere verbal definition then my knowledge in order to be true must agree with the object now i can only compare the object with my knowledge by this means namely by taking knowledge of it my knowledge then is to be verified by itself which is far from being sufficient for truth for as the object is external to me and the knowledge is in me i can only judge whether my knowledge of the object agrees with my knowledge of the object such a circle in explanation was called by the ancients diallelos and the logicians were accused of this fallacy by the sceptics who remarked that this account of truth was as if a man before a judicial tribunal should make a statement and appeal in support of it to a witness whom no one knows but who defends his own credibility by saying that the man who had called him as a witness is an honourable man

5274193 we were not really good in the field today we missed a couple of chances and that is something you cannot afford to do against a quality opposition
5274194 overall im quite happy with the way we performed all the players are chipping in and that is the most important thing
5274195 i think there was something for the fast bowlers at the start in the morning and the sri lankan fast bowlers exploited those conditions nicely
5274196 they got the early breakthroughs and they kept the pressure
5274197 we have not been chasing well in the recent past but i think it was just the little grass on the wicket which did us in
5274198 we thought that with a 10 oclock start it wouldnt do much we had expected it to be tough in the first half hour but there seemed to be something in it right along
5274199 it got a little better to bat on later but munaf patel and zaheer khan were still able to get something out of it
5274200 they bowled really well given the circumstances overall it was quite good but we had too few runs to defend

5274238 we have done very well to tie up some of our best players to long term deals especially wilson palacios who i thought was outstanding
5274239 if he continues to produce performances like that wilson has the ability to go to the top
5274240 last season he was linked with manchester united i dont know if there was interest but it was speculated on because of my past links
5274241 we worked hard to tie him down and sign a new contract he knows this year is a big one for him and it is going to be hard

5274249 its access road also leads to a play ground and the added traffic will be an added danger to the children who use it the land must be worth millions of pounds but if the rules are relaxed and its allowed it would be a free for all for every other scrap of land there is a lot of money to be made for developers here but no benefit for the community and weve been asking for a community centre for 50 years this land may be the last chance to have one in our area

5274264 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
5274265 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics
5274266 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
5274267 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american
5274268 i was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes which tends to get you a bit younger and i realised that this was for the rest of my life
5274269 i have to take insulin four times a day and if i want a doughnut i have to take extra insulin
5274270 this is normal for me now and after 28 years i have no other option
5274271 diabetes risk increases in those over 25 years old but it may go unnoticed for several years and that is why we are implementing a cardiovascular dis ease screening programme
5274272 we run a primary prevention programme in the community to help reduce overall obesity promote healthy eating and physical activity and this work is supported through health trainers and cookery clubs
5274273 the pct will soon commence a screening programme in gp practices that will identify patients at risk of developing diabetes and prevent diabetes related complications
5274274 these new figures are truly alarming and confirm that diabetes is one of the biggest health challenges facing the uk today
5274275 good self management awareness and improved access to specialist diabetes care service are crucial if we are to curb this growing health crisis and see a reduction in the number of people dying from diabetes and complications attributed to the condition
5274276 i started scoring in the school playground when i was 11 and havent really stopped
5274277 i briefly tried to play when i was younger as a bowler but got bored
5274278 i couldnt just watch a game it would drive me up the wall and my attention would wander after 10 minutes
5274279 scoring is different you keep your concentration and your interest in whats going on
5274280 ive not been married so my weekends have been my own
5274281 ive been to israel a couple of times but not during the cricket season

5274283 but more than that i love scoring because it keeps me in contact with young people
5274284 were very pleased weve had an improvement from last year which is what weve been working towards we have achieved a 66 per cent pass rate of a cs and one of our candidates was in the top 10 for chemistry out of 6 421 in the country
5274285 twyford students have more than exceeded expectations we received a record breaking set of a level grades 60 per cent of exams were graded a or b and 12 per cent of students achieved a clean sweep of straight as in all their subjects
5274286 we have done extremely well and i am chuffed by the large numbers who have worked so hard to get the best possible results
5274287 we have achieved a 98 per cent pass rate which means 9 8 out of every ten have managed to get their excellent grades
5274288 the girls are really happy with their results and i am thrilled for them
5274289 the staff here were brilliant and they have been really supportive of the girls i do not think a levels are getting easier
5274290 they have to learn so much because the subjects are broader
5274291 a levels are hard but different from many years ago
5274292 i wasnt sure if i would get my grade in history but im really pleased about my results
5274293 my family are really happy for me as its been really stressful for me especially in the last two months its been very challenging and lots of hard work it has been nice relaxing over the summer and preparing for my first year at oxford university where i will be studying medicine

5274298 rfid offers adopters of the technology a number of benefits from improvements in manufacturing inventory and distribution processes to reduced costs for product theft spoilage or obsolescence
5274299 its incumbent on our industry with help from organizations such as comptia to help customers overcome any obstacles to rfid usage and help them benefit from the efficiencies rfid can deliver
5274300 in the market rfid has come to refer to inventory tracking where nfc is more specific to person transactions a key difference between rfid and nfc protocols are the way in which the master slave relationship is handled
5274301 not only does nfc have a much shorter transmission range than rfid inherently making it more secure than traditional rfid but applications running over nfc technologies will more than likely encrypt the data that is being transmitted so even if there is a sniffer trying to pick up the transmission it wont pick up anything of use because of the encryption
5274302 security is something you dont just have with a purchased product you have to keep working on it every day this area needs a certain level of education on what it is and how it works in the wireless world the big challenge is how the rfid device integrates with security measures
5274303 there is no difference whether the use is short or long distance what matters more are other factors that affect security
5274304 there are multiple points with the hardware and software that allow the possibility of a breach
5274305 some vendors say im compliant today so i am ok but that is not true
5274306 rfid users need monitoring of the network this didnt exist before hardware and software vendors all have their own offerings the challenge is how to make it all work together this is the crux of what is happening
5274307 at the heart of our portal is that you can get a lot of information from the community
5274308 theres been user generated content in investing for a long time but its been in the form of discussion boards
5274309 with discussion boards things tend to fall off the bottom of the page and theres little incentive to make a really good post our site gives people a platform where they can share their knowledge
5274310 weve put in mechanisms to help prevent stuff like that
5274311 people are encouraged to build a long term reputation on the site
5274312 the only people who bother to spend a lot of time writing are the people who actually know something about the topic
5274313 i was frustrated that the personal finance blogosphere didnt really have a center spot
5274314 so i began putting together a catalog of personal finance blogs with listings by topic i came up with a framework that i hoped would make it easier for readers to find out the main theme of a blog i gave the opportunity for people to list their main topics give a summary of their blogs purpose and their views and even link to their best posts i hoped that this would be useful for readers to find blogs which fit what they were looking for and that bloggers would be willing to participate because it was free advertising
5274315 now that the former part is doing well id like to get more personal finance information itself on the site
5274316 sort of a stage two what are index funds what is a 401 k
5274317 i think its currently unique for its focus on the blogosphere for both bloggers and readers
5274318 there are lots of great finance facts in for example but nothing ive seen about personal finance blogs accumulating finance information is only one of the finwikians goals the main goal being to link people to sites which will provide them a more daily dose if they subscribe
5274319 people like to have a voice and they like flexibility
5274320 nothing is static on a wiki you can add your own blog listing or point of view to a topic then readers like to be able to find information quickly i hope people like this one because it helps them find useful information even if thats not on the wiki itself
5274321 the companys current business models root were developing commercial biological technologies and solutions for the chemical industry in the marketplace we became aware of the growing trends towards sustainable eco efficient solutions using renewable resources we saw a real need and opportunity for the next wave after the use of ethanol as an alternative fuels for bio renewable chemicals there is a strong demand and interest for renewable packaging solutions wal mart market news for example has initiated and pioneered a very strong sustainability initiative that focuses on reducing packaging and adherence to sustainable practices
5274322 we went about developing partners and providers in the supply chain to deliver bio renewable chemicals we met cosan sa market news approximately a year ago cosan is the worlds largest processor of sugarcane ethanol which happens to be 7 8 times more efficient than corn feedstock has significantly less carbon impact and is not a competing food source

5274415 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5274416 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5274417 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5274418 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5274419 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5274420 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as

5274422 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5274423 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5274424 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5274425 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5274426 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5274427 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5274428 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5274429 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5274430 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5274431 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5274432 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5274433 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5274434 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5274435 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5274436 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5274437 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5274438 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5274439 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5274440 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5274441 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5274442 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5274443 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5274444 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5274445 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
5274446 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
5274447 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
5274448 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
5274449 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
5274450 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
5274451 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5274452 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5274453 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5274454 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5274455 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5274456 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5274457 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5274458 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5274459 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5274460 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5274461 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5274462 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5274463 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5274464 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5274465 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5274466 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5274467 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5274468 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5274469 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5274470 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5274471 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5274472 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5274473 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
5274474 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
5274475 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5274476 sad but true civilized dialogue seems to have been olympically ignored i just hope that the moment a new team takes over we will have a different voice in congress and some civility will prevail
5274477 what is causing this serious division among americans you hear so many labels that it is difficult to keep track on what is what or seems to be we have two major opponents democrats and republicans that think of each other as the culprits of all the ills that assail us then we have liberals and conservatives leftists centrists moderates on the left moderates on the right whatever those extremes mean radicals on both sides plus some in the middle or thereabouts then the neo conservatives neo liberals theocrats libertarians fundamentalists fiscal conservatives ultraconservatives independents traditionalists etc
5274478 then there are the christian rightists which would lead one to suspect that there are also christian leftists and naturally an independent christian movement plus a southern christian movement and a northern coalition
5274479 think of it as the price for having the kind of freedoms we enjoy in theory those freedoms encourage you to create whatever comforts whether abstract or material suit you in a nutshell i can assure you that behind every one of those labels there is a personal agenda personal interests and occasionally an honest concern for the rest of the herd
5274480 youll have to explain such lofty descriptions to me it is too early in the morning for me to operate on all cylinders
5274481 if we look at history we find that the parties could not have been more different in the 1850s the democrats were generally pro slavery and also favored liberal economic policies that had a strong populist accent the republicans on the other hand were generally anti slavery and supported economic policies of a conservative nature
5274482 after the civil war the two parties exhibited clear tendencies that accentuated their differences the democratic party was pro white pro settler party and the republicans were decidedly pro slavery pro rancher party a popular perception at the time portrayed democrats as the farmers and the dominating owners as republicans
5274483 not very long by the end of the century both parties were pro white their major differences concerned budgets and public expenditures the democrats favored a liberal approach while the republicans were in favor of limited expenditures by the time we entered the second world war the roles were reversed northern democrats became pro civil rights although southern democrats opposed this while republicans were unclear on the issue this led to a split in the democratic party that lasted twenty years and even caused some southern democrats to make a separate run for the presidency to protest pro civil rights policies of the northern democrats strom thurmond and the dixiecrats in the year 1948 and governor george wallace in 1968
5274484 it seems to me that at present the roles of both parties with respect to economic policies are pretty much the same as they always have been
5274485 one thing we must not ignore is that all the political currents and domestic and foreign policies in government are affected by the fellow driving the wagon
5274486 so professor we are at a moment when policies are vague visions do not exist and problems abound in almost every area of life in the country beginning with immigration the economy health care increased threats from other countries invented wars and poor relations with other countries what should be done
5274487 boredom may allow the brain to recast the world in productive and creative ways
5274488 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
5274489 the community toilet scheme is a commonsense and cost effective solution to the lack of public toilets in london it is also an ingenious way around the high costs normally associated with running them
5274490 one of the biggest businesses in london is transport for london
5274491 as the mayor controls tfl and its budgets it would be good to hear from him what he is going to do himself rather than hear an exhortation to businesses to sign up for a scheme that is run by richmond council
5274492 i think many boroughs are interested in this scheme but it is their responsibility and their budgets that would be involved
5274493 they were in no way connected to the drug supply and in hindsight we should have consulted with them before the operation we apologise for any inconvenience caused and we now know that both work hard to improve the lives of youths in the area
5274494 as for the sentences handed to mitchell and rumble i think they reflect the gravity of the crime and the misery that drug dealing brings to an area
5274495 i am happy that our name has been cleared but it still harmed the business and i would have been happier if police would have informed us and not just raided us

5274505 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5274506 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5274507 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5274508 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5274509 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
5274510 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5274511 hay que tener en cuenta si el terreno est empinado o descendente para tirar la bola con la fuerza oportuna

5274514 si se pregunta ahora desde este punto de vista c mo ven y describen los maestros arqueros japoneses ese enfrentamiento del tirador consigo mismo su respuesta parecer m s que misteriosa porque para ellos el enfrentamiento consiste en que el arquero apunta a s mismo y sin embargo no a s mismo y que entonces tal vez haga blanco en s mismo y sin embargo no en s mismo de manera que ser a un tiempo el que asesta y es asestado el que acierta y es acertado entonces surge lo ltimo y lo m s excelso el arte deja de ser arte el tiro deja de ser tiro ser un tiro sin arco ni flecha el maestro vuelve a ser disc pulo el diestro principiante el fin comienzo y el comienzo consumaci n

5274528 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5274529 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5274530 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5274531 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5274532 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5274533 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5274534 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5274535 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5274536 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5274537 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5274538 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there
5274539 the check was from senator barack obama and made out to oil companies as payment for his vote on the 2005 energy bill that provided nearly 3 billion in subsidies for oil and natural gas production
5274540 a local volunteer found the valuable check at a gas station near the tallahassee airport yesterday
5274541 we can only assume that the document was mistakenly dropped by senator barack obamas campaign manager david plouffe he likely stopped at the gas station to check the tire pressure on his rental car prior to heading to last nights campaign fundraiser in tallahassee
5274542 i want to take a minute here on this issue because i think senator obama might be a little bit confused yesterday he accused me of having president bushs policies on energy thats odd because he voted for the presidents energy bill and i voted against it
5274543 i spoke up against the administration and congress and senator obama when they gave us an energy bill with more giveaways to big oil and really no solution to our energy problems
5274544 whether i win or lose the impeachment the nation will lose
5274545 they dont realize they can succeed against me but the country will undergo irreparable damage

5274555 russia is telling all former soviet republics this will happen to them if they set out towards nato
5274556 russia is currently in isolation all mass media around the world are objectively assessing what is going on russia is backed only by fidel castro and hugo chavez
5274557 we will go to iran in two weeks and would likely be accompanied by foreign minister ali babacan we will continue our efforts to finalize those works within a month
5274558 for example the wind industry it was nothing in the 1970s today one third of all terrestrial wind turbines in the world come from denmark
5274559 we got 99 percent of our energy from the middle east today it is zero
5274560 i have observed that in all other countries including in america people are complaining about how prices of gasoline are going up
5274561 the cure is not to reduce the price but on the contrary to raise it even higher to break our addiction to oil we are going to introduce a new tax reform in the direction of even higher taxation on energy and the revenue generated on that will be used to cut taxes on personal income so we will improve incentives to work and improve incentives to save energy and develop renewable energy
5274562 weve had 35 new competitors coming out of china in the last 18 months
5274563 we worked hard every day but the result was as you see and its really hard to take

5274572 el a o m s dif cil de la historia del teatro
5274573 la situaci n es sumamente delicada porque por m s que el teatro est en crisis no s lo el edificio sino nuestra jubilaci n los reglamentos la estructura nosotros y yo especialmente estamos abocados a las personas los artistas concluye el director del ballet tenemos grandes valores grandes profesionales de a os y j venes y todos tienen que continuar aprendiendo no hay que olvidarse de que son seres humanos y que tienen el derecho a que uno les d el trabajo para el que se prepararon tanto tiempo

5274580 we are continually monitoring the situation in relation to gang activity in ealing
5274581 and we are undertaking a range of activity to tackle serious youth violence
5274582 in addition to enforcement a strong partner ship programme is in place involving officers working with the youth offending service youth inclusion programmes and the families of offenders and gang members to tackle this problem
5274583 there is much positive work going on in ealing to divert young people away crime
5274584 young people who are involved in serious violence will be the focus of borough intelligence teams who will seek to engage with and work with our partners and the youths themselves to reduce their risk of further offending or of becoming a victim
5274585 we will continue to be strong and robust in our dealing with enforcement activity to tackle serious youth violence

5274588 by patriotism i mean devotion to a particular place and a particular way of life which one has no wish to force upon other people patriotism is of its nature defensive both militarily and culturally nationalism on the other hand is inseparable from the desire for power the abiding purpose of every nationalist is to secure more power and prestige not for himself but for the nation or other unity in which he has chosen to sink his own individuality
5274589 we are being told the anti missile defense system is targeted against something that does not exist doesnt it seem funny to you to say the least

5274601 historically mining villages in the north were a hotbed of greyhound tracks most of the working class households had a greyhound and used to race them as a social activity

5274605 can have their say about identity issues in the uk
5274606 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
5274607 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
5274608 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
5274609 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
5274610 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
5274611 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
5274612 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
5274613 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
5274614 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
5274615 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
5274616 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
5274617 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
5274618 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
5274619 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
5274620 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
5274621 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
5274622 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
5274623 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile
5274624 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
5274625 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end
5274626 its reasonable to go an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment
5274627 but its a good opportunity to practice like it was the big one
5274628 as long as the grotto stands key west will never again experience the full brunt of a hurricane
5274629 we basically said oh my gosh this is a big story and weve got to cover it
5274630 procrastinators seldom do absolutely nothing they do marginally useful things like gardening or
5274631 my first booking i dont think i can have any qualms about because i was a bit late in the tackle and caught the player
5274632 the second one i felt was a bit harsh i approached the referee and although i didnt swear i approached with arms raised and he said with the new rules its enough to get me sent off
5274633 but its something i was told about in the summer and im disappointed with myself
5274634 andy scott was disappointed with me and i felt id let down not just my team mates but let him down as well
5274635 its a long season though and hopefully ill make up for it
5274636 considering we were playing a championship side i think we can take a lot of positives
5274637 ive only played two games but ive seen more than enough to feel we will do well this season
5274638 we just want to make amends now by picking up three points against grimsby this saturday and getting our season going
5274639 i want to create lots of goals for them it will be important the midfielders score goals this season and not rely on them but we know what they are capable of
5274640 if they can get going early in the season it will fill everyone with confidence
5274641 i think the team will learn from last season i hope that we dont face relegation but the premier league is very difficult
5274642 it is one of the best leagues in the world i am looking forward and hope we finish in the middle of the table if we do i will be very very happy
5274643 i saw the way fulham play football i spoke a few times to the manager and the players impressed me and thats why ive come here
5274644 it is very important to do well in the first few games because if you do you can fly all season
5274645 it will be a very difficult first game for us this weekend at hull because they are promoted for the first time ever
5274646 they will want to play well in the first game of the premier league which will make it a tough game for us but we are ready
5274647 we threw the game away a game we dominated from start to finish 2 2 is a very poor result
5274648 it comes as a result of us not following the play and deciding the game is a little easy
5274649 every single day on the training field we make certain the players are getting the same message with regard to both their attacking and their defending
5274650 today we saw signs of it and when we saw the signs of it we saw a good team and when we didnt see the signs of it we saw a pretty team but im not interested in a pretty team i want a winning team
5274651 we created so many opportunities but unfortunately a lot of those opportunities were wasted
5274652 we were virtually passing the ball back to their goalkeeper when we had players in much better positions to score goals
5274653 we certainly got into positions where we could have either scored goals or created goal scoring opportunities time and time again
5274654 would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
5274655 people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5274656 we have to invent a new language with regard to russia that is what the european union is trying to do
5274657 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since august 7
5274658 russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
5274659 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5274660 the document signed by mikhail saakashvili completely omits the opening sentence the introductory part it is an integral part of the document and when the leaders of south ossetia abkhazia and now russia have signed the document they signed an agreed version not some shortened or edited one
5274661 this weeks events in georgia have taken that outcome another major step closer and when you appreciate that if obama is elected in november then america is actually putting brzezinski and soros in the white house you can see the potential for global mayhem

5274693 connecticut is a national leader in promoting clean energy in a way that makes sense and this exciting innovative program proves that once again
5274694 with the national economy in a slump with energy prices at frankly ridiculous highs and other prices including food prices headed for the sky our families are looking for alternatives the clean energy fund is making solar energy a real possibility for many more connecticut households by combining the success of its solar rebate program with the unique characteristics of this solar leasing program
5274695 implementing renewable energy is something that people want to have happen and by participating on facebook the users can actually see change occur it is a unique opportunity to witness and participate in companies going green
5274696 its like a petition with a guaranteed outcome from participation if facebook users get behind this effort they know they can make a change

5274701 with the devices recovered it may just be that the cards were only saved and the criminals did not have a chance to get hold of the card numbers
5274702 there will be an emergency meeting today with the garda the terminal vendors and the banks to try and close down on this

5274754 i screamed out loud while clicking over i really need to get a hobby or something
5274755 i think when you look at the quality of the players we have we surely should be up there but as weve seen before it doesnt always work out like that in the championship
5274756 its not always the team who have the better players who win the league
5274757 but i think we just need to keep going and keep improving and at the end of the season well see where we are i think were capable not only of top six but winning the league
5274758 i dont think we played the best football we can play with the quality we have in our squad
5274759 i think we started really really nervously all of us including me but as the game went on we performed better and better
5274760 we have a lot of things to work on after this game but its always nice to get the first game over with three points thats the most important thing
5274761 i think it might be the case that big expectations played a part in the nerves but i think its always the case in the first game because you want to play as well as you can and sometimes that doesnt work and you get nervous
5274762 i think it should be ok in the next couple of games
5274763 the most important was the first game and fitz scored two goals maybe next time i can do something similar
5274764 i didnt go for corners today because they had three men up front all the time but hopefully in the next couple of games i can improve that
5274765 i was confident i was going to end up at qpr but i was nervous about how long it was taking
5274766 at first i thought it shouldnt be a problem but then it took longer and longer and somebody even told me i might miss the august dead line and that wasnt a pleasant time for me
5274767 obviously i was very frustrated i cant say that i fell out with my old club but i was disappointed at how long they were taking to resolve it but now its behind me and im looking forward

5274796 the greatest strength of an army and of a nation
5274797 twenty years ago there were two players on the world stage
5274798 the united states and the soviet union i dont mean to be impolite but all the other countries including britain france and germany merely sat in the audience
5274799 today the united states is alone on the stage but we are in the front row of the balcony taking great pleasure in your performance we in russia are in the privileged position of understanding all the mistakes you are making because we made exactly the same mistakes just before our empire collapsed
5274800 our mistakes all stemmed from our rigid adherence to ideology rather than finding a balance between principles and practicalities our ideology was very different from yours but you too are now wedded to ideology a privatization free market ideology as an economic template for the entire world as you are discovering it may not be a good fit for the entire world you now look very tired perhaps from trying to govern the entire world by yourselves as we once tried to do and when a nation is tired it makes more and more foolish mistakes rigid ideology is a symptom of such fatigue
5274801 we have always had one theme and area we couldnt criticize the president

5274826 from 10 30 to 11 30 we take our late early morning nap
5274827 from 11 00 to 12 00 we bide our time and then eat lunch
5274828 from 1 00 to 2 00 we linger and loiter

5274831 from 3 30 to 4 00 we take our early late afternoon nap

5274834 as you can see that leaves almost no time for brooding lagging plodding or procrastinating and if we stopped to think or laugh wed never get nothing done
5274835 we want to get nothing done and we can do that without your help
5274836 its really quite strenuous doing nothing all day so once a week we take a holiday and go nowhere which was just where we were going when you came along would you care to join us
5274837 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5274838 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time
5274839 we can confirm that 2 para were involved in the incident in which four civilians tragically lost their lives
5274840 a full investigation will be carried out and our sympathies are with the families of the killed and injured civilians at this time
5274841 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5274842 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5274843 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5274844 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5274845 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5274846 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5274847 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5274848 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5274849 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5274850 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5274851 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5274852 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5274853 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5274854 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5274855 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5274856 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5274857 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5274858 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5274859 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5274860 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5274861 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5274862 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

5274930 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5274931 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5274932 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5274933 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5274934 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5274935 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5274936 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5274937 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5274938 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5274939 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

5274951 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

5274964 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5274965 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5274966 i wouldnt say theres a humanitarian catastrophe but theres an urgent need for primary products
5274967 our story begins with a young teenaged boy lets call him ali ali was an orphan and wanted to join the royal guards he was strong for his age and was an expert swordsman he always won every sword fighting competition he took part in in one such competition he was defeated in the final round by the prince himself the prince was of his age and had a younger sister watching ali fight the prince the princes coach and mentor recommended his name to the chief of security and took him under his wing alis dream was fulfilled he started training with the prince himself and soon grew in reputation as the second best swordsman in the entire kingdom bettered only by the prince the prince being of royal blood had the skill in his blood and ali never envied his position
5274968 over time the prince princess and ali became very close friends ali was made the head of the princesss bodyguard unit as the prince trusted no one else with the security of his beloved sister so everywhere the princess went ali took responsibility of her security and well being
5274969 trouble started when ali fell in love with her they were addicted to each other and though ali never told her about her feelings he had a hint that she felt the same way for him but royal blood demands its equal and ali knew it was an impossible mission to wish the princess for himself so the loyal servant that he was he went about his duty faithfully
5274970 but why didnt the princess find out a way through this she had the means to do it
5274971 nahi shehzade remember she was a girl even if she was a princess and her father the great emperor had a heart of gold such behaviour from a girl was against the customs of the great kingdom of arabia so the princess just prayed for a miracle which she knew would never happen while ali just cursed the customs and traditions a faceless society imposed on a man like himself
5274972 but this is not fair she loved ali what about him
5274973 two days before the nikaah the princess summoned ali to her garden and said ali you have been the rock i could lean on when my brother or father couldnt be there for me and i dont mean that in an insulting way you are one of the most beautiful things that ever happened to me but i must leave now my heart is with a man who has sworn to make me his life and i in turn have sworn to make him mine
5274974 ali saw the last pillars of his world crumbling i wish you both every happiness princess i am sure the crown prince will care and protect you like no one else he bowed in respect and left the place as quickly as possible fearing the princess would see his eyes moisten and he be betrayed by them
5274975 ali got himself transferred to the chief of elite patrol his eyes turned indifferent to every emotion that his heart dared feel he retained his good character but lost the human being within himself he became the sentinel in the shadows
5274976 because he broke a rule his mentor once taught him
5274977 have you seen the guards in the marketplace when you go to buy fruits
5274978 you feel safe when you see them dont you and yet have you ever seen anyone offering them fruits or a glass of water on a hot afternoon have you ever seen them play with any children on the street it is so because they are there to protect the citizens not to clown around and ask for refreshments
5274979 ali forgot that he was just a sentinel a sworn protector of the king and all that belonged to him he was sworn to protect the princess he was her first line of defense and her last

5274984 i wouldnt be happy saying anything because i dont really know the ins and outs of it all
5274985 i was geared up for it but i cant say anything much because i dont want it to come across as bad for myself brentford gillingham tottenham or whoever
5274986 id only be setting myself up if i said anything
5274987 they recalled leigh mills so he went back thats what happened and we get on with it
5274988 it was a bit of a surprise to come back to brentford and a bit last minute
5274989 but i wanted to be involved somewhere at the start of the season and it went through pretty much at the 11th hour
5274990 i didnt hesitate to come back steve coppell told me of his plans for the season and i was not really in them brentford came straight in and i wanted to be playing games at the start of the season so jumped at the move
5274991 i dont know if ill be here for more than a month it is out of my hands really i just hope to play games as much as i can and be involved in a first team where i am wanted so if thats here then great
5274992 i would consider a longer deal well take this month and see how it goes but im looking forward to it
5274993 obviously a couple of things need to be tightened up i feel that i need just a little bit of competitive match sharpness
5274994 i got a nick on their goal and if id been half a second quicker maybe i would have blocked it but it is just about getting the little habits back and getting sharp again
5274995 the second part of the first half cost us the game simple as that we didnt keep the ball we werent organised we didnt put the ball in the right areas we didnt hold the ball up front we completely went away from what we were doing in the first 20 minutes
5274996 we didnt have enough quality in the final third to get that goal a quality which we had shown in pre season so that is disappointing weve got to do better if were going to be up there in the league
5274997 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5274998 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5274999 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5275000 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5275001 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5275002 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5275003 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5275004 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5275005 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5275006 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5275007 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5275008 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5275009 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5275010 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5275011 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5275012 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5275013 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5275014 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5275015 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

5275133 as highlighted in a recent news release this initiative will reduce the companys burn rate while allowing forbes to clearly focus on further developing its nutraceutical business through both organic growth and m amp a initiatives within the functional food and dietary supplement markets

5275146 we would like some transparency regarding who those citizens were what their issues were and how the chinese government has supposedly resolved those issues because we have justifiable concern about the whereabouts and safety of those individuals given that there have been several documented incidents in which chinese citizens who have legally applied have gone missing and are potentially in detention

5275159 we have identified the popular condiment mayonnaise as the sole carrier of the highly contagious and deadly viral strain
5275160 there is no known cure and for now all citizens must seriously examine their mayo eating habits in order to avoid contracting the disease maybe you could try eating your turkey club with mustard or perhaps a small helping of relish
5275161 we assure you that normal mayonnaise consumption will resume as soon as we clear the dead and contain this lethal pathogen
5275162 all citizens within the affected zones please be advised if you absolutely have to put mayonnaise in your potato salad at least use a clean knife
5275163 and i cannot stress this enough if a glob of mayo comes in contact with your skin do not lick it off
5275164 if i get it i get it said louisville resident debra rothman 56
5275165 im not going to change my whole life around every time they come on tv and say something is bad for you
5275166 thankfully we didnt warn people not to eat spoonfuls of mayo straight out of the jar
5275167 left unchecked hellmansviridae could potentially wipe out all human life in north america by the end of lunch on friday
5275168 but tests show it can be treated with antibiotics when patients reduce their daily intake of mayonnaise to three tablespoons or less per 12 hours
5275169 sadly only one in 100 americans has effectively been able to reduce personal mayo consumption to these levels

5275172 the dx 88 bla will include the most extensive placebo controlled assessment of any therapy for the treatment of hae and was based on a dyax developed comprehensive endpoint evaluation we look forward to submitting our bla and ultimately commercializing this innovative therapy

5275177 ronnie will also be remembered for his promotion of irish music both at home and around the world

5275185 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5275186 what i found out is that combustion generated particles contain environmentally persistent free radicals
5275187 when the radicals are associated with particles they can apparently exist indefinitely
5275188 the implication is you can have the same environmentally related diseases by exposure to airborne fine particles that you can get from cigarettes
5275189 these airborne free radicals are of interest but i am not sure we are at a point where our scalpel is sharp enough to dissect the individual components of air pollution that cause problems for people
5275190 there are studies that show that modifying free radicals can alter the course of disease
5275191 but the implications of this what it means to clinics what it means to doctors what it means to regulators i think we are a long way from pulling that together
5275192 my mother was also against it for the obvious reasons
5275193 it was just one of those childhood dreams i never grew out of everybody was against it because nobody thinks of jewish people as police officers
5275194 i always wanted to be a cop but my wife sharona was against it
5275195 but i convinced her it took her two years she thinks its a dangerous job i was sick of my other job because there was no room to grow i wanted a future
5275196 the next class is going to have 30 or 40

5275205 founded in september 1919 the communist party of the united states of america is an organization unique in american history it is not a true political party and differs fundamentally from all political parties in this country it is in fact a russian inspired moscow dominated anti american quasi military conspiracy against our government our ideals and our freedoms
5275206 one of the most loyal and pro soviet communist parties in the world and has unfalteringly accepted soviet direction and funding over the years
5275207 frank marshall davis a forgotten voice in the chicago black renaissance
5275208 from now on i knew i would be described as a communist but frankly i had reached the stage where i didnt give a damn too many people i respected as freedom fighters were listed as red for me to fear name calling
5275209 due to his associates and involvement in what were considered in the forties to be radical communist groups
5275210 however by the time he davis returned to chicago and the renaissance he inevitably associated with people connected with the communist party since they were most likely to be involved in civil rights labor art and the fight for equality it seems that davis did join the party for a short time although on other occasions he denied it
5275211 davis met richard wright through his 1936 participation in the national negro congress which was alleged to be a communist front organization
5275212 davis did not see wright again after openly criticizing wrights attack of sic the communist party following the latters defection although both men held on to the hope of equality
5275213 davis joined the league of american writers a national united front organization for the communist party mobilized by the alarming rise of power of hitler and mussolini
5275214 if the relationship with davis was as blas as the associated press makes it sound why is obama mum about it and why did he try to hide davis identity in his first memoir published in 1995
5275215 with the exception of my family and a handful of public figures the names of most characters have been changed for the sake of privacy
5275216 but there was no need to protect davis privacy he had long been dead more likely the cryptic references to his communist mentor were and still are designed to protect obamas background from the scrutiny it deserves

5275231 the afghans did not go to canada to kill the canadians rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghan to please the fascist regime of america
5275232 the canadian people have to realize if their sisters their brothers and their children are being killed in afghanistan it is because of the wrong policy of the government of canada and their falling under the influence of others when they sent occupation soldiers to afghanistan
5275233 events such as logar will happen again because occupied afghanistan looks at all actors that are established in the interest of america with an eye of hostility
5275234 you have to convince your government to put an end to the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans

5275243 there will be some credit worthy borrowers who will need to go somewhere else
5275244 weve gone national with our lenders because we were concerned

5275281 we are trying to boost the infrastructure for this project we want some land and are in talks with the delhi government though nothing has been finalised as yet we would prefer to have land near our campus

5275376 seeing the first maps pop up on our screen was a real thrill for us they represent the results of hard work by all members of our team
5275377 most developed nations have major research efforts focused on understanding and learning to use these energy rich deposits of methane
5275378 our plan is to build the infrastructure that will allow entire generations of scientists to study these deposits firsthand using robotic telepresence no other country is there yet
5275379 the key to choosing these locations is to find sites that are protected but within reach of really interesting processes that were trying to investigate
5275380 this represents the first demonstration that kidney injury in membranous nephropathy can regress after selective depletion of b cells thus the present data provide a strong rationale for using rituximab to treat patients with membranous nephropathy
5275381 whether this may apply to other similar kidney conditions and may translate into long term protection from renal function loss and the potentially life threatening complications remains to be established
5275382 although it is an old scientific chestnut we must once again emphasize how important it is to support continuing basic science on tropical forests
5275383 we placed our participants in an fmri scanner to measure their brain activity while we first showed our subject short 3s movie clips of an actor sipping from a cup and then looking disgusted
5275384 later on we asked them to read and imagine short emotional scenarios for instance walking along a street bumping into a reeking drunken man who then starts to retch and realizing that some of his vomit had ended up in your own mouth finally we measured their brain activity while the participants tasted unpleasant solutions in the scanner
5275385 is that in all three cases the same location of the anterior insula lit up the anterior insula is the part of the brain that is the heart of our feeling of disgust patients who have damage to the insula because of a brain infection for instance lose this capacity to feel disgusted if you give them sour milk they would drink it happily and say it tastes like soda
5275386 what this means is that whether we see a movie or read a story the same thing happens we activate our bodily representations of what it feels like to be disgusted and that is why reading a book and viewing a movie can both make us feel as if we literally feel what the protagonist is going through
5275387 our previous studies showed that soft landing can be used to prepare ultrapure peptide layers on substrates the question we faced was in addition to controlling purity can we also control the structure of the molecules we showed we could
5275388 because we were starting from something that wasnt helical in solution we were a little pessimistic whether it would work at all
5275389 we found an interesting pathway to conduct different types of chemical reactions between complex molecules and substrates that will potentially enable us to prepare materials that cannot be made by standard methods
5275390 we hope to conduct lots of chemistry on the thin films

5275734 the revolutionary guard has begun to train iraqi shiite youths from the families that were deported to iran on the eve of the us invasion in the past the revolutionary guard trained some 10 000 fighters of hezbollah and the badr corps currently the badr organization throughout the war with iraq
5275735 however the fighters of the badr organization and the secret units of the islamic dawa party returned to iraq after the downfall of saddam hussein in the company of the late leader of the iraqi islamic supreme council ayatollah muhammad baqir al hakim after their return they joined the new police security and army units

5275781 workers have protested 14 times but sat down to negotiate only 11 times in the past six months
5275782 she says she will do whatever it takes to get into a size 8 and doesnt care how much it costs
5275783 what she wont be doing is hitting the gym or dieting because she loves her curry too much she lives on takeaways and ready meals she gets by the lorry load
5275784 she cant wait to be trim and wear little skirts and crop tops she hates covering up her boobs and legs but has no choice as she is in such bad shape
5275785 the problem is that although the surgeon can get the weight off by sucking it out its up to kerry to keep it off

5275789 lembrando da corrida em laguna algumas vezes o stoner deita na curva muito mais do que eu e isso pode ser alguma coisa

5275792 about 25 percent of my patients have ragweed allergy and i make sure they are well prepared for peak pollen season
5275793 since allergic rhinitis also known as hay fever can quickly develop into other complications such as ear infections sinusitis recurrent sore throats cough and headache its important that ragweed allergy is treated and well controlled studies show it also can cause altered sleep patterns fatigue irritability and poor school performance accurate allergy diagnosis and proper treatment can eliminate or alleviate most of these problems
5275794 eu nunca mais volto para a china eu estou muito chateada com a organiza o que na verdade desorganizada eles prejudicaram a minha prova

5275796 by being able to silence certain genes we may be able to suppress genes that can cause diseases such as hiv aids cancer inflammation and diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems we now know we can focus on these genes and potentially change the ultimate course of many diseases that have a major impact on peoples lives
5275797 basically in china people are free to say their opinions
5275798 as long as you dont organize if you organize youre likely to get in trouble
5275799 if you compare chinese responses against those of other asian societies there is a considerable degree of criticalness expressed about political and civil rights
5275800 focus on established democracies we know much less about what people think about human rights in democratizing or authoritarian countries
5275801 if citizens dont have accurate information about actual political conditions it is difficult to offer a meaningful or even critical opinion
5275802 anything that challenges the notion of building this great strong china
5275803 political authorities have swept under the rug theyre using the glory and prestige of the olympics to show chinese citizens and the world that china is strong and to further legitimize their continued rule over the country
5275804 theyve unleashed this event the question is how much longer can the communist party keep accurate information about domestic political conditions and the outside world from getting in
5275805 the legal cases between oklahoma and arkansas evolved from a conflict over point source pollution involving municipal wastewater discharge to a conflict over nonpoint source pollution in the form of nutrient runoff from poultry litter
5275806 in light of three decades or more of significant structural changes in the animal agricultural production system this shift from point source to nonpoint source mirrors the evolution of how water quality has been addressed since the enactment of clean water act
5275807 discernable confined and discrete conveyances including any pipe ditch channel tunnel conduit well from which pollutants may be discharged
5275808 a consequence of these structural changes is that extraordinary amounts of animal waste are produced in geographically limited areas
5275809 this waste must be disposed of or utilized somehow and a traditional and common method is for producers to apply it to the land as fertilizer
5275810 policymakers may begin to consider new policy approaches to addressing nonpoint source pollution particularly if they conclude that addressing the issue through region based litigation may not be the most effective tool to address a national issue the thought might be that perhaps theres a better way to address these problems without litigation or overly burdensome government regulation
5275811 linking this approach with some type of comprehensive watershed management system may be a new paradigm in which policymakers can address nonpoint source pollution from agriculture

5275819 the hummer is way too expensive for the chinese military and demand from civilian buyers is not big enough to justify a purchase especially with oil prices running near an all time high

5275951 it is now clear the original optimistic ipv6 deployment plans have failed however the eventual exhaustion of ipv4 allocations is very real and ipv6 adoption will happen based on our analysis at the current rate of adoption we are a decade or more away from pervasive adoption of dual stack support for ipv6
5275952 with that said throughout the world government mandates are spurring ipv6 adoption for example in the u s a federal mandate was met and all major vendors publicly declared their ipv6 readiness the beijing olympics are being highlighted as the first global showcase for ipv6 technology by chinas government despite the slow start theres reason for optimism
5275953 we have worked with arbor networks on a number of initiatives and they offer isps the opportunity to come together in a way that fosters collaboration as well as a better understanding of industry challenges
5275954 ipv6 represents the future of the internet and adoption of this protocol will continue to increase we look forward to working with the isp community and our customers to ensure a smooth transition
5275955 there has been much said and written about ipv6 and the challenges service providers face with this inevitable transition
5275956 the question arbor has been trying to answer in conjunction with our service provider customers is how much ipv6 traffic is on the internet it has been very gratifying to have so much support and cooperation from the global isp community

5275959 we would urge ifas to consider the provision for ctfs when speaking to their clients about their outgoings and financial commitments starting and maintaining ctf payments is vitally important and a small financial commitment by parents now can reduce the need for a much bigger one in the future many of todays young adults currently find themselves in financial hardship over a lack of saving and an over availability of cheap credit we are keen that future generations enter adulthood with an asset in order to avoid the same problems

5275989 currently available 10gbase t phy multi chip silicon from our competition does not permit deployment of dual port nics due to their high power in excess of 10w port
5275990 aquantias low power aq1001 enables dual port nics with a proven 90nm design

5276004 we continue to see increased demand for higher performance pcie solutions beyond the traditional pc applications
5276005 with this four lane solution we enable designers to reduce both the cost and power dissipation of their designs enabling a broader set of high data rate applications to quickly and easily migrate to pcie in short we enable designers to spend time on their design not spend their time and resources on making pcie work
5276006 like its predecessor pcie is moving beyond pcs into embedded and communications systems
5276007 the ability to quickly migrate designs to pcie will enable manufacturers to take advantage of the market opportunity and leverage fpgas to provide new functionality in these applications this is key for applications such as dsp acceleration cards high definition hd video capture and data acquisition cards which we expect to migrate rapidly to pcie over the next 18 months

5276011 sudans anti terrorism special courts are nothing but a travesty of justice
5276012 some of the people sentenced yesterday only met their lawyers for the first time during the trial while several said they suffered torture when they were held incommunicado and that they were forced to confess to crimes
5276013 those trials were clearly unfair and now sudan is preparing to try yet more people with this system how is that justice
5276014 marks of ill treatment were still clearly visible on their bodies
5276015 the sudanese government has the duty to investigate crimes and bring the perpetrators to justice but they must do it in accordance to international law and their own constitution which guarantees fair trials
5276016 we urge the sudanese authorities not to execute these men and to review their cases immediately according to sudans laws

5276040 deep desire to be at the center of things is served by extreme self confidence a combination that makes narcissists attractive and even charming buoyed by a coterie of admiring friends and associates protected by the armor of positive self regard someone with a mild to moderate case of narcissism can float through life feeling pretty good about himself since they feel entitled to special treatment they are easily offended and readily harbor grudges yet narcissists are often very popular at least in the short term
5276041 the beauty of being a narcissist is that even when disaster stares you in the face you feel neither doubt nor remorse
5276042 but the narcissists would say its totally the other persons fault theyre completely willing to step on someone

5276056 a big male chimp weighs about 50 kilos 110 pounds yet could easily rip the arm off someone
5276057 the australopiths would really excel at gymnastics and diving because of the greater upper body strength longer arms
5276058 their short stature and low body mass would also have greatly increased their ability to do flips and spins because of the low rotational inertia of their body
5276059 australopithecus represented a biped on the ground with much more climbing ability and without striding locomotion
5276060 running would have been possible but probably not as efficient
5276061 most human sports that we value the most with exception of power sports involve this incredible ability to run or do aerobic capacity
5276062 if you compare neanderthals to yourself or most people probably living in mechanized urban areas the neanderthals would appear very strong
5276063 however if you compared them to early modern humans the neanderthals and early humans would not appear very different
5276064 going to the gym going on a bike ride even most olympic training doesnt do the same thing as having the same serious level of lifting walking that people have done in the past
5276065 neanderthals were somewhat shorter and stockier than the average sapiens but there are modern humans with the same proportions

5276085 i am specializing in such a unique field of organic organic organic it is a most difficult challenge
5276086 we must treat more flowers with something other than water and find this plant based organic solvent that is the biggest challenge
5276087 i have to come up with something somehow but its getting harder and harder
5276088 when you are making the conscientious effort to use the organic and natural raw materials obtained from china or india or australia or south america then that certainly places on you a responsibility to be able to stand behind that aspect of your product

5276132 it was a difficult rally for me as i dont have much experience on tarmac and i came here to learn some more and make improvements
5276133 i knew i wasnt going to be challenging with the leaders here but we made good progress and learnt a lot for spain and corsica so from that point of view it was a positive event for us
5276134 i was on the limit this sunday morning to try to catch duval i had a big escape in the second test of the day i had a corner marked in my notes with a small cut but i took a big cut it was a high speed bend and the car was up on two wheels for a long time it was close
5276135 on the third stage i saw i was three seconds down on duval at the third split section and decided to ease off and settle for fourth i didnt want to make any mistakes chasing third and risk losing what i had
5276136 i set some great stage times on friday and with a bit more consistency i will be able to fight for a top place on this surface but i couldnt match the speed of the top two here but i feel my asphalt driving has improved and it was just unfortunate i lost time with a puncture last night

5276168 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs
5276169 its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
5276170 the approach hes taken is one that is political he expects there to be no change in the outcome this is only to draw attention to himself and his re election efforts it begs the question whether the congressman is as concerned about the 15 and 16 year old girls at western hills high school as he is about his election i think its a question voters should be asking

5276175 were talking about more than just copyright here were talking about the digital environment
5276176 this legislation represents a real threat to the vibrancy of that online environment
5276177 the activity online proves that a broad range of stakeholders with varying interests and vantage points care deeply about this issue
5276178 there are so many canadians that have issues will this bill
5276179 and the online forum has helped us get informed which leads to offline rallies
5276180 after we meet members write about what we learned post videos back on to the blogs and facebook group
5276181 weve got to allow political videos but with some safeguards
5276182 i think some things should still be off limits there will be grey areas
5276183 our worry is that films are an emotive medium passions can get stirred up and people can get carried away i think this is a valid concern but i dont think an outright ban is still sensible because this is how people communicate on the web in daily life
5276184 we have to move away from this total ban and find ways to allow people to let off steam a little bit more but safely
5276185 i think well still call it speakers corner no need to call it demonstrators corner
5276186 soon the only place where internet radio will survive is on illegal sites in foreign parts where governments are brave enough to ignore the recording company mafiaa still with the us government on both sides of the house taking bribes from the entertainment business in election year we can guarantee that such nations will be dubbed terrorists and troops sent in any day now
5276187 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the field guides
5276188 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special you of course have to be cautious but i was still very excited at the prospect of possibly having found a new species of bird
5276189 finding the olive backed forest robin strongly underscores the importance of our research this helps us show the conservation importance of the area
5276190 the most intriguing finding was that subjects seemed to accept mushrooms as a palatable and suitable culinary substitute for meat
5276191 they didnt compensate for the lower calorie mushroom meal by eating more food later in the day
5276192 has the potential to change the way people do archaeology
5276193 this approach really brings in the computer as a research partner to archaeologists
5276194 we mimic the archaeologists methods as much as possible so that they can really use our system as a tool
5276195 when fully developed this system could reduce the time needed to reconstruct a wall from years to months it could free up archaeologists for other valuable tasks such as restoration and ethnographic study
5276196 this showed that the system could work in a real life situation
5276197 having this ability to really exhaustively try everything very quickly could potentially be quite helpful
5276198 reconstructing these frescoes is incredibly complex given the condition of the fragments and the sheer number of fragments
5276199 the computer takes over the laborious parts of the process while leaving the important intuitive decisions to the humans
5276200 our approach is unique in the world no one else has yet developed customized immunotherapy using the virus from individual patients
5276201 this experimental technique remains long and costly for the moment but were hoping it will hold the promise of a completely innovative and widely available treatment in the future
5276202 at this stage we have shown that the technique doesnt cause side effects or an undesirable auto immune response
5276203 health canada has approved a multicentre clinical trial across the country that will let us further assess the techniques effectiveness at controlling hiv reproduction were hoping that the fda in the united states will also give us the go ahead soon so that our pharmaceutical partner argos therapeutics can begin testing in the united states
5276204 by far most companies are pursuing very limited footprints toe prints really instead of comprehensive ones
5276205 there are estimated to be thousands of members in the bia family and having a source for obtaining large quantities of specific bia molecules is critical to gaining access to the diverse functional activities provided by these molecules
5276206 but even the intermediate molecules that we are producing can exhibit important and valuable activities and a related area of research will be to examine more closely the pharmacological activities of these metabolites and derivatives now that pure sources can be obtained
5276207 if one thinks of these molecules as encoding functions that are of interest to us the ability to produce nonnatural alkaloids will provide access to more diverse functions and activities by expanding to nonnatural alkaloids we can search for molecules that provide enhanced activities new activities and not be limited by the activities that have been selected for in nature
5276208 our work has the potential to result in new therapeutic drugs for a broad range of diseases this work also provides an exciting example of the increased complexity with which we are engineering biological systems to address global societal challenges
5276209 imaging and measurement resolutions as well as atomic structural ambiguities defects obscured the results of most experiments and provided unreliable mechanical predictions
5276210 we can be certain of all the quantities we have measured and the results match quantum mechanics predictions very well
5276211 irradiating a multiwalled carbon nanotube with an intense electron beam actually forms bonds among the shells of the tube this is like combining multiple nanotubes into one to form a stronger structure
5276212 the same procedure used to strengthen individual multiwalled nanotubes by irradiation may also be used to link together individual nanotubes into a bundle

5276218 we do not know where everyone got the report that he died from dengue because the autopsy results are on monday
5276219 we are trying to ensure we have a situation to get greater value so that by using a whole new process we might be able to get greater value and more patients at these institutions
5276220 on behalf of the caribbean community i congratulate shelly ann fraser sherone simpson kerron stewart for the historical win at the olympics your gold and silver medal successes demonstrate your desire to excel and represent your country and region well we are truly proud
5276221 i join the region in also commending usain bolt for claiming the first 100 metre olympic crown for jamaica and setting a new world record
5276222 there is no doubt that the recent accomplishments of our athletes in beijing will be spoken of for some time to come but i am sure that the admiration of their accomplishments is felt by all of their fellow athletes in beijing as well as the entire region
5276223 all he knew is that he was going to come back with a medal he said in the semi finals that once he made it to the final then a medal will be certain whether gold silver or bronze
5276224 i was speechless yesterday for a while today i cried
5276225 little jamaica our country is blessed with some of the best if not the best talent you can find

5276230 our study reveals potentially clinically relevant differences in the gene expression of different cancer types and represents a reference framework for interpretation of smaller scale functional studies
5276231 this segregation of tumors into three groups with distinct expression patterns is surprising clearly the developmental trajectory provides a meaningful background for capturing large scale differences in gene expression across diverse conditions
5276232 the finding is significant because it changes our understanding of how light input from the eye can affect activity and sleep patterns
5276233 this suggests that we have discovered an additional mechanism for regulating nocturnity and diurnity that is located in the light input pathways of the eye
5276234 the significance of this research for humans is that it could ultimately lead to new treatments for sleep disorders perhaps even eye drops that would target neural pathways to the brains central timekeeper
5276235 currently one in 28 americans age 40 and over suffer from blindness or low vision and this number is estimated to double in the next 15 years
5276236 our discovery of the switching mechanism in the eye has direct relevance with respect to the eventual development of therapies to treat circadian and sleep disorders in the visually impaired
5276237 we now can study how iaps contribute to the development of cancer in a living animal and develop drugs to prevent or thwart the disease
5276238 cancer cells thrive by disabling the molecular machinery that tells sick cells to die
5276239 by removing the ring we wanted to see whether we would trick the machinery to turn back on and thats what happened cells die more readily making it much more difficult for cancer to be established
5276240 as a result our bodies and brains feel less difference between day and night
5276241 people are sleeping in front of the tv or nodding off during conversations and taking long afternoon naps this leads to less sleep at night in a way their sleep habits become more like babies and less like those of healthy adults who sleep in consolidated periods during the night
5276242 improves sleep and daytime vigilance helping to re organize the circadian system the bodys internal clock
5276243 many people still assume that parenting ends when a child turns 18 but in our culture today there is a longer extension of adolescence

5276260 it looks like youre someone whos very down to earth when it comes to love you tend to be pretty realistic about what makes a lifelong partnership work you understand the value of forging a love based on friendship respect and shared values in fact often your relationships develop out of friendship and your lover tends to be your best friend marriage and childern are probably central to your life as far as youre concerned a true relationship is one that matures with tim and work
5276261 you feel most comfortable in a solid relationship based on trust love is your life blood it fills you with energy and makes the world seem even more beautiful right now you couldnt imagine a better place to be youre positively glowing with happiness and feeling very secure just how you like it
5276262 home life is really important to you it is in the focus of all the love that you have to give love is about being completely natural with one another about being able to take things slow and find a qiet place away from all the demands of every day life you have a very lustful sensual nature you often remain detatched from those around you you are a true pleasure seeker
5276263 love is cuddling up on the sofa with a glass of wine or lounging in bed with the sunday papers the physical side of love is essential to you touching really helps you to connect with the one you love
5276264 shines a harsh and frankly unflattering light on the attitudes we canadians have concerning mental health

5276273 americans failed to serve a purpose greater than there own self interest
5276274 with millions of people spending significant amounts of their time online everyday it makes perfect sense for us to provide the big and tall niche with an open forum to share stories and interact with their peers in a way that was previously unavailable to them
5276275 currently a growing number of our customers fall into the 18 24 age bracket and with the launch of boldxl we will have another medium to reach this younger demographic further expanding our customer base
5276276 we put a lot of time and research into this initiative to guarantee there is an appetite for this online community amongst a younger demographic and received an overwhelming response from our existing customers
5276277 we are very excited about boldxl and look forward to seeing the online community grow connecting the big and tall niche and beyond

5276291 the communications transport is preferably a com or dcom interface
5276292 at the heart of our portal is that you can get a lot of information from the community
5276293 theres been user generated content in investing for a long time but its been in the form of discussion boards
5276294 with discussion boards things tend to fall off the bottom of the page and theres little incentive to make a really good post our site gives people a platform where they can share their knowledge
5276295 weve put in mechanisms to help prevent stuff like that
5276296 people are encouraged to build a long term reputation on the site
5276297 the only people who bother to spend a lot of time writing are the people who actually know something about the topic
5276298 i was frustrated that the personal finance blogosphere didnt really have a center spot
5276299 so i began putting together a catalog of personal finance blogs with listings by topic i came up with a framework that i hoped would make it easier for readers to find out the main theme of a blog i gave the opportunity for people to list their main topics give a summary of their blogs purpose and their views and even link to their best posts i hoped that this would be useful for readers to find blogs which fit what they were looking for and that bloggers would be willing to participate because it was free advertising
5276300 now that the former part is doing well id like to get more personal finance information itself on the site
5276301 sort of a stage two what are index funds what is a 401 k
5276302 i think its currently unique for its focus on the blogosphere for both bloggers and readers
5276303 there are lots of great finance facts in for example but nothing ive seen about personal finance blogs accumulating finance information is only one of the finwikians goals the main goal being to link people to sites which will provide them a more daily dose if they subscribe
5276304 people like to have a voice and they like flexibility
5276305 nothing is static on a wiki you can add your own blog listing or point of view to a topic then readers like to be able to find information quickly i hope people like this one because it helps them find useful information even if thats not on the wiki itself
5276306 i hate people who tell me what i should and should not like
5276307 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war didnt floss daily is outrageous

5276310 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5276311 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5276312 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5276313 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5276314 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5276315 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5276316 foi mais do que eu esperava jogamos muito bem e vencemos por 4 a 0 isso muito importante e mais importante ainda o fato de o torcedor do chelsea ter visto um jogo bonito e a conquista de tr s pontos

5276322 scientists are avidly seeking ways to develop a new spectrum of fuels to replace those now at risk of depletion while releasing far fewer or zero climate altering
5276323 why has energy come to play such a pivotal role in world affairs to begin with its continued availability in great profusion has never been as
5276324 what really underlies the conflict and it has to do with the fact that the us has eyed the caspian sea which lies just to the east of georgia as an energy corridor for exporting caspian sea oil and gas to the west bypassing russia and this was the brainchild of bill clinton who saw an opportunity when the soviet union broke apart to gain access to caspian oil and gas but he didnt want this new energy to flow through russia or through iran which were the only natural ways to export the energy
5276325 so he anointed georgia as a bridge to build new pipelines through georgia to the west and it was he who masterminded the construction of the btc pipeline which is now the outlet for this oil with new pipelines supposedly following for natural gas and he chose georgia for this purpose and also built up the georgian military to protect the pipeline and russia has been furious about this ever since and i think thats the reason that they have clung so tightly to abkhazia and south ossetia ever since
5276326 weve poured hundreds of millions of dollars into beefing up the georgian military and this is unmistakable in the state department and military department of defense justifications for arming the georgian military specifically to protect the btc pipeline against sabotage and attack so looking into the pentagon and state department documents theres no question that this is about energy security not about democracy or human rights or the other justifications that have been given
5276327 ich halte diese entscheidung nicht f r korrekt denn ich habe nichts getan was diese summe rechtfertigen w rde
5276328 wir sind im juniorenbereich in diesem jahr wieder so erfolgreich gewesen da ist es erschreckend wie wenig letzten endes im erwachsenenbereich oben ankommt
5276329 man kann den einzelnen nicht allein lassen wenn er vom junioren in den erwachsenenbereich kommt
5276330 sieht es bei den n chsten olympischen spielen wahrscheinlich noch schlimmer aus
5276331 wir hatten auch viel pech hier mit krankheitsbedingten ausf llen
5276332 andererseits muss man sagen dass auch in der ganzen saison sehr viel schiefgelaufen ist in verschiedenen bereichen

5276340 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5276341 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5276342 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5276343 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5276344 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5276345 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5276346 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5276347 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5276348 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5276349 this would be a far more important presence and it was this tollway that basically wiped out the important and well established early community and caused it to relocate

5276371 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5276372 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5276373 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5276374 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5276375 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5276376 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5276377 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5276378 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5276379 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5276380 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5276381 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5276382 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5276383 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5276384 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5276385 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5276386 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5276387 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5276388 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5276389 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5276390 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5276391 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5276392 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5276393 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5276394 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5276395 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5276396 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5276397 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5276398 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5276399 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5276400 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5276401 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5276402 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5276403 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5276404 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5276405 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5276406 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5276407 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5276408 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5276409 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5276410 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5276411 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5276412 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5276413 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5276414 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5276415 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5276416 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5276417 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5276418 obama made no big mistakes but his tendency to somewhat windy generalities meant he wasn t particularly compelling mccain who went second was crisp by contrast and his anecdotes colorful
5276419 a 93 year old hemet woman shot at an intruder who entered her home but she missed and the bullet went through a window and over a neighbors home hemet police said friday the woman shot at the intruder who entered her home in the 300 block of south street shortly before 11 p m thursday lt duane wisehart said she called police and they surrounded the home until she came out without the weapon wisehart said the woman told police she heard someone in her home and armed herself with a pistol then shot at the intruder as the man walked down her hall toward her the bullet went through a kitchen window of the small two bedroom home through a shade structure and over a house next door wisehart said the intruder took some pieces of jewelry and a watch wisehart said the woman will not be facing charges wisehart said

5276421 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5276422 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5276423 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5276424 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5276425 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5276426 la educaci n que la sociedad fomentaba para las mujeres estaba m s en concordancia con el estereotipo femenino que con la aceptaci n de su incursi n en la literatura
5276427 culta hab a recibido una educaci n inusual para la poca y era una devota de la literatura progresista
5276428 que hacen de la imagen de la mujer una figura cautiva de los cuarteles de la representaci n de acuerdo con la imaginaci n masculina
5276429 muchos de mis recuerdos de esa primera infancia est n encerrados en
5276430 rilke dice que los recuerdos de juventud y de infancia son una mina inagotable para el escritor superior a todo lo que encierran los libros y dem s medios de cultura ser cierto a mi me ha hecho impresi n esa idea
5276431 teresa de la parra esgrime con toda valent a una nueva concepci n de la historia en contra de la historia acad mica y heroica a que estamos acostumbrados la mujer juega uno de los papeles m s importantes en esa historia silente que no ha sido relatada por nuestros libros y que sin embargo ha sido fundamental para la formaci n del alma americana
5276432 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5276433 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5276434 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5276435 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5276436 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5276437 this was the first day i held all eight together
5276438 im going to prepare myself like i did for these games and be ready to compete in london
5276439 theres some times i still want to hit before i retire
5276440 i always looked up to libby and leisel and now i dont feel any different from them
5276441 im going to be in the sport a while and i want some fun
5276442 this schedule you dont go into it as excited as i feel like i would if i was only swimming just two or three and a relay
5276443 im going to attack it the same way i did swimming
5276444 its a new generation and its now time to step aside
5276445 anybody can say whatever they want but i know im clean
5276446 people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts i have the results to prove it

5276458 i told tina watching videotape i cant believe how well shes playing for us defensively
5276459 defensively shes been one of our most consistent players i cant even put into words how much her defense has meant to our defensive effort
5276460 when you work hard you get good results were starting everything with our defense being the catalyst of our offense is great but if you want to play offense you have to play defense
5276461 i just happen to be in the right place at the right time
5276462 anyone on this team can go on runs like ive had
5276463 shes one of the best players in the world that nobody talks about
5276464 i think tina is one of those players that not a lot of people give credit to except maybe other players for what she brings to the game
5276465 as players or competitors its something that you recognize about tina always
5276466 houston coach van chancellor did his homework and got her out of l a in the first place
5276467 i was hoping wed be able to play together but that story never worked out it has been great considering where were from and how far weve come im really proud of her what type of player and person shes grown into
5276468 im never not tired but you have a job to do and a responsibility
5276469 when two people arrive on the same level they are champions but this competition doesnt belong to us it is the iocs
5276470 i believe its correct to have two gold medals but this is my modest opinion the ioc is different
5276471 its nothing i can control and honestly i can say it has been very fair to me and i got the biggest gold medal of them all
5276472 there were people that tied in the all around back when i was competing i guess they dont want that now
5276473 i didnt expect to win a gold medal because the more i want it the more pressure i feel
5276474 its more nerve racking than competing with the whole team
5276475 i was nervous but i was prepared mentally and i believed i had the ability to win
5276476 i told tina watching videotape i cant believe how well shes playing for us defensively
5276477 defensively shes been one of our most consistent players i cant even put into words how much her defense has meant to our defensive effort
5276478 when you work hard you get good results were starting everything with our defense being the catalyst of our offense is great but if you want to play offense you have to play defense
5276479 i just happen to be in the right place at the right time

5276486 im never not tired but you have a job to do and a responsibility
5276487 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5276488 this is a planning took where all things are going
5276489 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5276490 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5276491 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5276492 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5276493 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5276494 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5276495 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5276496 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5276497 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5276498 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5276499 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5276500 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5276501 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5276502 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5276503 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5276504 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5276505 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5276506 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5276507 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5276508 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5276509 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5276510 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5276511 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5276512 el tramposo lanzamiento morrissey live at the hollywood bowl ha sido realizado por warner sin consulta alguna a mi persona y es un incumplimiento de las condiciones dise adas por ellos mismos en un acuerdo hecho para el filme entre warner y mi ex manager trat ndose de warner probablemente el dise o de la portada ser atroz es el trabajo de unos sacadineros e insto a la gente a que no lo compre yo no tengo un contrato con warner y ninguna regal a de este dvd me llegar a m por favor gasta tu dinero en cualquier otro sitio gracias morrissey
5276513 i honestly was in shock when i saw that we got the same scores and my name was in second it was weird
5276514 thats nothing i can control unfortunately thats all up to the judges i guess they liked her routine better which is fine with me i did what i could
5276515 i tied in my olympic games there were people that tied back when i was competing but i guess they dont want it now
5276516 she did what she could do she stuck the landing the only one by the way but it doesnt matter
5276517 i just want to go out there and leave it all on the track and just hope for the best
5276518 after the 100 i had little time for celebration all i have done is a big sleep and some relaxation
5276519 it was not all that easy today but im going to go out there all the time do my thing and show the world that im probably the best
5276520 it felt a lot better than this morning there are no problems
5276521 i was disappointed by the road races but i knew that this was completely different and i felt good after the road
5276522 i felt nobody had the strength to do many laps in front of the bunch i was happy i was the only one to get a lap
5276523 the team started very badly i hope this is the beginning of good results
5276524 i was disappointed by the road races but i knew that this was completely different and i felt good after the road
5276525 i felt nobody had the strength to do many laps in front of the bunch i was happy i was the only one to get a lap
5276526 the team started very badly i hope this is the beginning of good results
5276527 early to bed early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise
5276528 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5276529 it can be rebecca adlingtons baths or beckys whatever she wants were really proud of her and the way our leisure facilities here have given her a hand
5276530 mansfield council has decided to refurbish and rename its swimming pool in honour of their olympic medalist edinburgh council plan to demolish the velodrome where chris hoy started his career the contrast couldnt be clearer its embarrassing and an insult to scotlands most successful olympian surely the capital city of scotland can at least match the ambition of mansfield we call on edinburgh council to retain the cycling velodrome at meadowbank and rename it in honour of chris hoy
5276531 if meadowbank hadnt existed there is no question that i wouldnt be where i am today
5276532 without the grassroots introduction to the sport there will be a whole generation of kids that wont have the opportunity to try out track cycling and one or two could have gone on to become olympic or world champions
5276533 the future of the sport depends on there being a facility and i fear for the future of scottish cycling there is expertise in edinburgh thats been built up over 40 years and that will all be lost if meadowbank isnt replaced but it is politicians and not sportspeople who make these decisions and sometimes it is a shame that we do not have more of a voice
5276534 i dont think that can be considered parallel to the effort to bring women into absolutely equal gender balance
5276535 id be surprised and disappointed if we took such draconian action all it would do is have the athletes of that country suffer
5276536 you run down the path and you hit that board you have to figure out a way to hit that board right and land in the pit
5276537 we recently came across your site while searching for bloggers
5276538 of this group the vast majority constitute arab or muslim states
5276539 since islam prohibits proselytism by other religions foreign religious workers will in effect be denied entry to conduct religious work
5276540 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation
5276541 the mere fact that rabbis would be openly invited to the kingdom a country where in principle jews are not permitted to visit would have constituted a turning point
5276542 this gives us a better picture of what countries discriminate against us based on religion
5276543 theres a lot of police in front of my house
5276544 from july 31 im not allowed to go by taxi or drive my own car
5276545 they say theyre neighbors but i dont think they are
5276546 i think the chinese government has succeeded very well in silencing not only well known dissidents and activists but also ngo activists and academics who are outspoken and lawyers and basically pretty much everyone in addition to the usual suspects
5276547 this is a very very large police effort to keep people away from
5276548 according to islamic law islam is the final and most complete religion and therefore muslims already practice full freedom of religion cannot return to an older belief christianity or judaism
5276549 me interesa ver bien la propuesta de gobierno que tienen y si creo que es la forma de ayudarle a la naci n pues vamos a ayudarla desde ah

5276555 i never thought i would ever have to go to the police station but on account of the lords ministry i went to the police station for the first time
5276556 these officials care very little about belief but they do care about peoples behavior and organizational activities
5276557 they dont want religion to become a force for an anti government movement
5276558 a party leader in one province told me young people would rather join a church than the party
5276559 we want to give advice next time dont have things like this that challenge the people of islam
5276560 in our reply to an earlier warning letter from the same person we remarked that the home ministry had not defined the concept of religion in the application form for the renewal of printing permit nor is there a definition of religion found in the federal constitution
5276561 so we asked them to point out where we had gone wrong we are awaiting their reply
5276562 the article was an ethical analysis about the world after the sept 11 attacks on the world trade center towers
5276563 christian groups shouldnt be discriminated against for their beliefs and we are pleased with the courts recognition of that
5276564 a time of prayer petitioning god for guidance in the churchs proper role in the political process
5276565 singing praise and giving thanks to god for the freedom we have in this country to participate in the political process
5276566 so the israelis have no worries about the november election
5276567 the yearlong prelude to the games has seen a major crackdown on free speech and dissent a massive sweep of undesirables from the host city and increasing abuses of ethnic minority tibetans and uighurs
5276568 i would put china in the top 10 percent of all the authoritarian states in the world

5276570 classed as belonging to the free nations of the earth

5276583 insbesondere klassische altersvorsorgeprodukte werden von den kunden oft noch als zu starr zu komplex oder als zu wenig renditestark angesehen

5276595 rick did an amazing job of asking the questions most of us would ask the candidates if we could
5276596 i just really liked how john mccain gave well stated answers he didnt even have to think he takes a stand barack has a charming personality he didnt always give the direct answer
5276597 i think obama did very well and he doesnt need to win a majority of this audience he merely needs to keep mccains support below typical trends but this was mccains best performance in memory for the first time i can think of in 08 at least he comes across as the kind of guy a lot of conservatives can want to vote for rather than merely settle for
5276598 but i also think that its worth noting that but i suspect he may be riding high for a while after tonight
5276599 obama wasnt just bad but that mccain was very good
5276600 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5276601 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection

5276615 i was really excited when i heard about it and the fact that they are openly out there they look so happy together
5276616 its great that people are able to marry each other whether you are gay or straight
5276617 we met through mutual friends she was a fan of my show and we decided to meet up and just hit it off
5276618 with another girl you never have to worry about how you look in the morning because we both look sh y and its fine
5276619 i thought she was a party girl but she is not
5276620 she will actually stay home with me which is awesome
5276621 i certainly would know what would make him tick and how to beat him
5276622 and he would certainly know the same about me so i would have to say we would probably tie
5276623 we are so proud of you here michael in america and the way youve handled yourself
5276624 you know you werent born when i did what i did im sure i was a part of your inspiration and i take that as a full compliment
5276625 they say you judge ones character by the company that you keep and im happy to keep company with you
5276626 your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
5276627 miss jolie says she likes john mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh
5276628 arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
5276629 it might be good for your asian and african childrens self esteem to know you support
5276630 cukup baguslah secara makro namun dalam kenyataan di lapangan masih belum terlaksana sepenuhnya
5276631 kalau dilihat dari pidato sby memang bagus secara makro tetapi masih banyak yang perlu diimplementasikan bukti yang bisa kita lihat yaitu para mahasiswa setia belum bisa kuliah karena masih dipengungsian
5276632 pada hari kemerdekaan ini banyak yang belum menerima kemerdekaan yaitu tentang hak hak sebagai warga negara
5276633 namun wajar kalau sby melakukan hal tersebut karena beliau seorang politisi dan pemimpin negara
5276634 jadi dimanakah kemerdekaan hakiki yang dicita citakan bapak pendiri bangsa ini
5276635 tidak ada istilah artis bisa masuk daftar caleg di pdip hanya karena keartisannya tapi karena mereka memang sudah jadi aktivis partai sejak lama
5276636 seseorang yang kami dudukkan sebagai caleg memang betul betul dipersiapkan kami memilih artis karena yang bersangkutan memang memahami persoalan kemasyarakatan mereka juga kami latih dan kami haruskan untuk duduk dalam kepengurusan partai
5276637 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
5276638 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5276639 im sure many of you will also recall from your experiences in war as i do from mine that when youre somewhere on the other side of the world in the service of america you pay attention to the news from back home
5276640 though victory in iraq is finally in sight a great deal still depends on the decisions and good judgment of the next president says mccain
5276641 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance
5276642 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen
5276643 first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5276644 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5276645 even in retrospect mccain says of his opponent who plans to address the vfw at its convention in orlando on tuesday
5276646 im proud to count many of you in this room as personal friends including my good friend retired marine corps sergeant major paul chevalier of new hampshire
5276647 all of us take pride in being members of this great organization
5276648 in all the years since the men and women of the vfw have stayed faithful to their mission of serving those who have served their country
5276649 the men and women of the vfw know the value of freedom because you have been its protectors
5276650 though victory in iraq is finally in sight a great deal still depends on the decisions and good judgment of the next president
5276651 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square senator obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq
5276652 thanks to the courage and sacrifice of our soldiers sailors airmen and marines and to brave iraqi fighters the surge has succeeded
5276653 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5276654 its been a while since most americans including most of our leaders and diplomats have viewed russia as a threat to the peace
5276655 for some time now i have been making the case for a dramatic acceleration of domestic energy production
5276656 when russia first invaded georgia some people may have wondered why events in this part of the world should be any concern of ours
5276657 if i am elected president they will have that support
5276658 through decades of struggle free nations prevailed over tyranny in large measure because of the sacrifices of the men and women of the united states armed forces
5276659 the walter reed scandal was a disgrace unworthy of this nation and i intend to make sure that nothing like it is ever repeated
5276660 reform begins with appointing a secretary of veterans affairs who is a leader of the highest caliber and who listens to veterans and veterans service organizations
5276661 veterans must be treated fairly and expeditiously as they seek compensation for disability or illness
5276662 as president i will do all that is in my power to ensure that those who serve today and those who have served in the past have access to the highest quality health mental health and rehabilitative care in the world
5276663 im not here to tell you that there is a cost that is too high to be paid in the care of our nations veterans
5276664 exactly because funding va programs command bipartisan support some in the congress like to attach unrelated appropriations and earmarks to va bills
5276665 when we make it clear to congress that no earmark bill will be signed into law that will save many billions of dollars that can be applied to essential priorities and above all to the care of our veterans
5276666 my administration will create a veterans care access card to be used by veterans with illness or injury incurred during their military service and by those with lower incomes
5276667 this card is not intended to either replace the va or privatize veterans health care as some have wrongly charged
5276668 even so there are veterans eligible for care who are not currently able to receive it on account of distance wait times or the absence of certain specialties and for this group the new card i propose will offer better alternatives to provide the benefits they have earned
5276669 reform must also recognize that greater care is needed for certain types of injuries
5276670 the va must also broaden its care for the women who are entering the armed forces in greater numbers than ever
5276671 these are among the elements of my reform agenda for the va system
5276672 i suppose from my opponents vantage point veterans concerns are just one more issue to be spun or worked to advantage
5276673 as a political proposition it would have much easier for me to have just signed on to what i considered flawed legislation
5276674 no one who has worn the uniform of his or her country can ever take these matters lightly
5276675 the next president will have many responsibilities to the american people and i take them all seriously
5276676 it is every veterans hope that should their children be called upon to answer a call to arms the battle will be necessary and the field well chosen
5276677 most of our clients were moving to an soa and web services architecture integrating many different applications into their external web site for example the sonic esb allowed us to implement customer client business processes with zero manual effort that is perhaps our biggest payback
5276678 two important business goals for the next 12 months include adding to our client base and improving the end user experience the sonic esb is helping mccamish achieve and ultimately exceed these goals
5276679 mccamish systems is a great example of a longstanding user of the progress openedge business application development platform and a progress application partner that sees the operational and financial value in implementing a services based architecture
5276680 mccamish was very comfortable with the openedge platform and found the sonic esb to be the cost effective choice in helping them deliver reliable and high quality service as a result mccamishs partners can introduce new insurance products rapidly and seamlessly while maintaining product profitability
5276681 ieder half jaar geven we in samenwerking met thuiswinkel org de thuiswinkel markt monitor uit een onderzoek naar online consumentenbestedingen van nederlandse consumenten bij webwinkels
5276682 in deze thuiswinkel markt monitor gaat het om aankopen van consumenten bij reguliere online thuiswinkelbedrijven er worden geen transacties van consumenten onderling via online handelsplaatsen c t c meegenomen
5276683 het is een eerste onderzoek en daarmee een voorlopige schatting van de markt we hebben plannen om zoals met de thuiswinkel markt monitor een grootschalig onderzoek op te zetten om de waarde van verhandelde goederen via deze online handelsplaatsen in de toekomst structureel te kunnen meten
5276684 de groep autos is met ruim 1 1 miljoen unieke bezoekers de populairste groep op marktplaats nl

5276686 ik kijk met zeer veel genoegen terug op mijn jaren bij de glossys samen met de collegas uit het cluster hebben we veel kansen gehad veel tot stand gebracht en voor veel vernieuwing gezorgd uitgever van het wooncluster met ook weer prachtige merken betekent een nieuwe uitdaging waar ik graag veel energie in wil stoppen om onze ambities te verwezenlijken ik heb er veel zin in
5276687 ik ben erg blij met de benoeming van ard als uitgever wonen hij brengt een schat aan ervaring mee op de lezers en op de advertentiemarkt zowel binnen sanoma als daarbuiten de laatste jaren heeft ard ons glossy portfolio succesvol gepositioneerd en mind magazine en grazia gelanceerd met hem aan het roer kunnen we onze sterkte positie in het woonsegment nog verder uitbouwen
5276688 in tien jaar iab heb ik veel interactieve trends tot in de keuken mogen bekijken de uitdaging is om tijdig op deze trends in te spelen met nieuwe bureaus dankzij de goede resultaten van lacomunidad heb ik kunnen investeren in de ontwikkeling van viraltracker dat in 2007 een internationale doorbraak beleefde de insights van viraltracker en de aansluiting bij het wereldwijde wpp netwerk opende zoveel internationale deuren dat de laatste stap naar een triple play propositie in mijn ogen niet mocht uitblijven de oprichting van socialmedia8 was dus een logische laatste stap
5276689 we try to give the kids a break from everyday and we like to get their families out to give them a break as well its just a really fun day for the kids
5276690 some of these kids look forward to this year after year they even request which boat to go on
5276691 the most positive thing for a rototarian is that you participated in something you consider worthwhile we dont have to put up with the everyday differences these families have to put up with they need a break not just the kids the families as well
5276692 one who is not taking part in the battle nor has the sheer intention to die is in the branch of hypocrisy
5276693 i dont want to be a person like it has been mentioned about i dont want to be deprived of the huge amounts or lessons allah has prepared for the believers in the hereafter
5276694 big target and taking it out like a military base in the uk praise be to allah
5276695 our group is growing we need to plan better and adapt now a few more people are showing interest we need to confirm and encourage i want to have a group of at least 12
5276696 what i want to do is cause trouble for the kuffar with hit and runs everywhere cause fear and panic in their countries make them nervous so they make mistakes
5276697 im just going out there all the time to do my thing and show the world im probably the best
5276698 there is no god but allah and muhammad pbuh is his messenger
5276699 i am with you give firmness to the believers i will instil terror into the hearts of the unbelievers smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger tips off them

5276701 ein entscheidender faktor bei unserer entscheidung die aveva marine l sung einzusetzen war die breite und qualit t der schiffbau spezifischen funktionalit t unter anderem zur stahlkonstruktion
5276702 aus dem bauch heraus gesagt d rfte das was die kollegen an glycidamid gefunden haben keinen wesentlichen beitrag leisten
5276703 ich mache mir dabei wesentlich mehr sorgen um bergewicht als um glycidamid
5276704 auf vielen etiketten steht zum frittieren und braten geeignet auch auf len die viele unges ttigte oder sogar mehrfach unges ttigte fetts uren enthalten
5276705 unsere ersten ergebnisse legen nahe dass man zum braten und frittieren lieber le mit ges ttigten fetts uren verwenden sollte
5276706 crucially these are areas that are not represented by waterstones bookshops and it helps us to achieve representation in that market
5276707 small consideration for the leases but that amount is very small
5276708 at the end of the day the objective is firstly to secure their long term future as bookshops
5276709 secondly the size of the stores fits the waterstones offer very well and im sure the branches and staff will benefit from being waterstones
5276710 einmal feststellen dass der rundfunk f r unsere zeit genauso eine entwicklung der geistigen und seelischen beeinflussung der massen eingeleitet hat wie zu anbruch der reformation die erfindung der buchdruckerkunst
5276711 die erfindung und ausgestaltung f r das praktische gemeinschaftsleben der menschen ist von einer wahrhaft revolution ren bedeutung
5276712 wer den feind h rt wird mit zuchthaus bestraft und wer abgeh rte nachrichten weiterverbreitet wird hingerichtet

5276715 man hat immer die kameras im kopf mit einem nacktbad im regenwald teich habe ich aber kein problem und ramona wird sich auch nicht hinter steinen verstecken
5276716 were cool as long as youre cool to us this is my mommy and i dont like unfamiliar people around her

5276718 where rose the mountains there to him were friends where rolled the ocean thereon was his home where a blue sky and glowing clime extends he had the passion and the power to roam
5276719 i wanted to live deep and suck the marrow of life to drive life into a corner and reduce it to then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it and publish its meanness to the world or if it were sublime to know it by experience
5276720 two roads diverged in a wood and i i took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference

5276737 dient allein dazu die gewalt und t tungsorgien als nationale heldentat zu legitimieren
5276738 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5276739 that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys
5276740 a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5276741 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5276742 the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5276743 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5276744 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5276745 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5276746 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5276747 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5276748 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5276749 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5276750 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous
5276751 i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5276752 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5276753 i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on
5276754 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that its bad for the entire garage i think
5276755 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of rusian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5276756 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5276757 i think theres no doubt there will be further consequences
5276758 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5276759 this wont be resolved unless there is a political solution if that doesnt happen frustrations will mount
5276760 russia has seriously damaged its own efforts to integrate into the west
5276761 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5276762 there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5276763 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5276764 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5276765 i pray the government stops this down sliding and take the country out of this crisis
5276766 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership
5276767 we estimate it will remain depressed until buyers traffic picks up noticeably but for this to occur mortgage rates must come down quickly and significantly
5276768 barring any extreme developments such as massive government intervention we estimate housing prices will not trough until fourth quarter of 2009 at the earliest
5276769 save afghan lives defeating the enemies plan to discredit the afghan government
5276770 we recommend to all afghans to be vigilant at large public events and other locations where crowds gather and report suspicious behavior to security forces
5276771 all the time the enemy tries to carry out any kind of activity that it can but the afghan security forces are ready and we have already taken measures to disrupt any enemy activity
5276772 we were basically stuck up the canyon without our rafts
5276773 we had no supplies no food and very little water we lost everything
5276774 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5276775 were not as concerned about it as we initially were
5276776 energy management is the fastest growing area of telkonets business with constantly growing market demand our partnerships with energy efficiency programs such as focus on energy are an important element in this success working throughout the us to help hotels offset the cost of implementing energy management systems hotel owners are in a real win win situation with a great opportunity to benefit from immediate savings by taking advantage of these rebate systems there has never been a better time for the hospitality industry to go green
5276777 with the addition of these two large full service hotels davidson now has a portfolio which includes five upscale hotels in florida
5276778 we are attracted to the strong demographics in both orlando and miami and following the implementation of our proprietary marketing and management systems we believe these hotels will quickly gain strong market share and substantially increased value for ownership
5276779 these two properties reflect davidsons on going strategy to augment its overall growth through third party management
5276780 we continue to seek out opportunities where we can apply our skills to help owners unlock new or unrealized value in their assets this is particularly important in todays economic conditions
5276781 evidence was put before the director of public prosecutions last night and the decision was taken to charge two men a 17 year old and a 20 year old
5276782 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5276783 it is a really messy picture at the moment and the next 48 hours will be very unsettled
5276784 there is an area of deep low pressure and the centre of it is the south west coast of
5276785 bands of rain and showers will continue from there but it will get calmer as the week progresses
5276786 by wednesday we should see more sunshine as the low pressure moves away and the wind dies down
5276787 the same old folks that brought you george w bush
5276788 john mccain has never questioned sen obamas patriotism but he clearly does question sen obamas experience and judgment
5276789 however seeking advice and getting a personalised illustration before committing to an equity release product is absolutely essential so its quite concerning to see from the research that so many people dont know where to go for guidance
5276790 a track towards refining assets cannot yet be fully discounted but in any case the intensity forecast of the storm does not make it a major threat
5276791 i think dollar direction will be key this week barring any meteorological surprises if it continues to register gains despite looking somewhat extended the conditions for a sustained move lower in oil seem conceivable
5276792 sentiment in commodity markets has swung heavily negative in the past month as a firming u s dollar is met with falling global demand conditions

5276796 citrix resellers determine the price at which they sell to their customers based on their purchase price from distributors their business model and the overall scope of each solution
5276797 the increase is a result of the rising costs of doing business globally based upon the inflation of various currencies in comparison to the u s dollar upon which citrix pricing is based
5276798 to preclude placing a financial burden on his family who had already suffered through one tragedy andrew purchased a life insurance policy from aig andrew chose to list his parents as sole beneficiaries as he was unmarried and did not have children
5276799 when two people arrive on the same level they are champions
5276800 i believe its correct to have two gold medals but this is my modest opinion the ioc is different
5276801 its nothing i can control and honestly i can say it has been very fair to me and i got the biggest gold medal of them all
5276802 there were people that tied in the all around back when i was competing i guess they dont want that now
5276803 i didnt expect to win a gold medal because the more i want it the more pressure i feel
5276804 its more nerve racking than competing with the whole team
5276805 particularly when it comes down to such a minuscule margin liukins silver gave the united states six overall medals
5276806 i was nervous but i was prepared mentally and i believed i had the ability to win
5276807 all around champion yang wei wasnt nearly as impressive as in his previous rings routines but his strength and steadiness earned him silver
5276808 n o nos conhecemos pessoalmente meu nome eliza sou jornalista escrevo por um motivo especial pode parecer estranho mas vale a pena tentar

5276839 while you no longer need a multi million dollar budget to get a message out you do need access to the internet
5276840 but even though the largest of the political bloggers now have a combined monthly audience of over 10 million people they cant use traditional press venues at the convention the big tent is about access for the new media and technology vendors such as meru google and digg are key to helping us provide that access
5276841 because its a tent everything has to be imported and as many as 400 users may be online simultaneously at peak periods with a changing mix of data voice and video
5276842 so we were looking for a product that was quick to deploy and could support a lot of people in a small area the meru wireless lan addressed those demands
5276843 we chose 11n because the area around the convention will be extremely dense with journalists and electronic news gathering equipment all competing for bandwidth
5276844 because meru 11n dual radio access points can work in the both 5 0 or 2 4 gigahertz ghz radio spectrums users with newer 11n equipped laptops or handhelds can occupy the 5 0 ghz band while those with legacy 802 11b g clients use the 2 4 ghz band since meru 11n access points are backward compatible with the 11b g standards they can serve any type of wi fi client
5276845 will bring predictability to the inherently unpredictable almost chaotic environment that characterizes media coverage of a national political convention this environment has an absolute requirement for a robust infrastructure that simultaneously supports voice data and video and can adjust in real time to changing demands
5276846 the popularity of news video on the web and the ease with which video can today be produced and disseminated digitally is proving a terrific opportunity for marketers wishing to achieve high rates of return from their olympic sponsorship

5276854 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5276855 the reason that people believe there needs to be a constitutional amendment some people believe is because uh of the concern that uh uh about same sex marriage im not somebody whos sic promotes same sec sic marriage but i do believe in civil unions i do believe that we should not um that that for a gay partners sic to want to visit each other in the hospital for the state to say you know what thats all right i dont think in any way inhibits my core beliefs about what marriage are sic

5276860 sometimes people say the stars are aligned and things are meant to be
5276861 i just felt like this was destiny for me to get it here this is where it all started i have special place in my heart for columbus and the fans appreciate me so this is where it was supposed to happen maybe all the things i went through in toronto was because it wasnt meant to happen there
5276862 we were a little bit lethargic but as you said the character of the team is great they listen to what we have to say at halftime they came out in the second half with a lot more energy we were a lot more direct with our play we stretched their defense got behind them and as a result of that we started to create some chances and then the goals came
5276863 we have to continue his fitness he looked like he was fatigued before the end of the match thats not a good sign weve got to continue on that first and foremost once we get him to a level that were all comfortable with his fitness level then we know the soccers there
5276864 it was an exciting game for the fans with some great attacking play some loose defending and a lot of goals
5276865 the results were the most important thing to come out of tonight we won we are on top of the conference and we are happy about that
5276866 its the longest 94 minutes i think ive ever had in football we were all willing the players to get a result
5276867 i felt that from the start we really came out and were hungry
5276868 we had some good opportunities and were able to get a goal early which really got a weight off our shoulders weve had a lot of chances the last three or four games and havent scored any so it was nice to get an early one
5276869 we just didnt take our chances in the game we started off poorly and it was hard to pick up we didnt have the ability and strength on the field to do a better job in the end
5276870 i talked with the guys about how big this game would have been and it was
5276871 hopefully it can raise the guys confidence and we can not only come back after a deficit like we did last game but we can also manage to build on a one nil up lead which is very difficult to manage sometimes and we did that so hopefully the guys can benefit from this

5276899 tutta una questione di vitamine continua la ribuffo perch difendono anche lorganismo dai raggi solari ma la frutta e la verdura sono utili anche per lapporto di sali minerali
5276900 un ruolo da protagonisti infine riservato alla frutta e alla verdura che contengono antiossidanti i pomodori in particolare perch contengono licopene elemento noto per lattivit antiproliferativa utile a ridurre il colesterolo le infiammazioni e a potenziare le difese immunitarie

5276905 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5276906 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5276915 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5276916 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5276917 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5276918 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5276919 members of our armed forces traveling on official orders should not have to bear any cost whatsoever associated with that official travel
5276920 our men and women in uniform deserve our utmost respect and gratitude not additional unnecessary paperwork
5276921 the current arrangement of filing reimbursement paperwork to recoup costs associated with excess baggage is an undue burden on our servicemen and women who are bravely entering or leaving a combat zone
5276922 while we have not seen an official letter from senator clinton we have responded to the vfw commander advising him that the majority of ata members have re evaluated their baggage policies for military personnel on active duty orders
5276923 were not seeing the thousands the hundreds who streamed through in the past

5276926 one of the things i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy thats what were going to be talking about
5276927 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5276928 then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the states should make the decisions within their own states

5276932 there is no divide to the air that we all breathe or the clean water that we all depend on
5276933 there is no divide between our common desire to make the border region an economic powerhouse
5276934 we know that when storms or other natural disasters occur they do not respect political boundaries
5276935 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5276936 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5276937 im not going to talk about conversations with the campaign
5276938 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it
5276939 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5276940 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states
5276941 i think its the responsibility of the vice president if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5276942 i dont want to be vice president im not going to be the nominee
5276943 ich bin optimistisch da sich der dienst in zehn bis f nfzehn jahren so gewandelt hat da seine einstellungskriterien v llig jenen im rest des modernen gro britannien entsprechen
5276944 of course if the numbers are overwhelming thats all going to be out the door
5276945 if were inundated with a bunch of civil unrest it doesnt matter how well we prepare if we get severe numbers its going to take us forever
5276946 its just ridiculous the thing looks like a dog pound
5276947 even if you only put dogs in there people will be complaining about it i think you ought to have the red cross and amnesty international come take a look at this thing
5276948 the city does not anticipate the need for widespread arrests
5276949 the good news is obviously no state is better prepared or organized to deal with whatever comes this way than the state of florida
5276950 youll be in our thoughts and prayers i am very impressed by what youre doing and what youre prepared to do coming from a state that is not often hit by a hurricane im incredibly impressed
5276951 we have assumed that for the first 72 hours we should rely on no one but ourselves because thats how long it takes for help to come
5276952 weve had a fortunate two years but for all of us who were here the memories of 2004 and 2005 are still fresh
5276953 now is the time for floridians to take the steps necessary to prepare should fays track bring her over our state this week
5276954 we hope that this storm does not turn into a hurricane and if it does that the damage is minimal
5276955 it is practically and financially untenable to hold the 2014 winter olympic games less than 20 miles from a zone of conflict particularly when the prospective host country has played a significant role in the escalation of that conflict
5276956 it is premature to make judgments about how events happening today might sit with an event taking place six years from now
5276957 all our efforts here in china are spent on learning from these wonderful beijing games so that we can enhance our offer for the olympic movement
5276958 at sochi 2014 our focus is to deliver an excellent and innovative games that will inspire the world we are on track to achive this

5276979 about 25 percent of my patients have ragweed allergy and i make sure they are well prepared for peak pollen season
5276980 since allergic rhinitis also known as hay fever can quickly develop into other complications such as ear infections sinusitis recurrent sore throats cough and headache its important that ragweed allergy is treated and well controlled studies show it also can cause altered sleep patterns fatigue irritability and poor school performance accurate allergy diagnosis and proper treatment can eliminate or alleviate most of these problems

5277039 the government has basically never publicly reviewed whether the conflict of interests rules work they dont
5277040 its one of these cases that does go right to the heart of the procurement process
5277041 we maintain that our work for the nrc was free of even the potential for a conflict of interest

5277045 saic was looking at ways of taking advantage of these opportunities
5277046 saic was interested in pursuing the billions of dollars worth of business that would result from doe and other commercial nuclear facilities performing decontamination and decommissioning of their facilities
5277047 saic did not disclose this as an organizational conflict of interest relationship
5277048 if saic has an oci relationship to disclose it is not enough to simply bury it in the text of a technical proposal if there is an oci relationship it is not nrcs obligation to find it

5277107 operation paul and silas opas through which it freed the hostages was brokered by chief edwin clark governor timipre sylva of bayelsa state and coventry cathedral so that any other person outside the three influences that make claim to the freeing of the hostages was a liar
5277108 it has come to our notice that for political and or for financial motives some government officials and politicians are giving the impression that they were an influence in the negotiations and subsequent release of the german hostages on august 14 2008
5277109 to our knowledge the only key persons or group that played any relevant mediator role towards the success of opas operation paul and silas are chief e k clark chief timipre sylva the governor of bayelsa state and the coventry cathedral

5277139 di sinilah perlunya usaha pencerahan terhadap islam yang dilakukan semua pihak
5277140 karena dalam konsep islam alquran adalah lafzhan wa manan dari allah lafal dan maknanya dari allah
5277141 alquran adalah kitab yang tanzil yang diturunkan melalui malaikat jibril kepada nabi muhammad saw
5277142 ini jelas menunjukkan upaya untuk melecehkan kitab suci umat islam siapapun pelakunya

5277150 the laws of the civilized community apply only within it outside its confines other lands were fair game what was the trojan war but a giant plundering expedition
5277151 the fundamental philosophical divergences between socrates and athens he and his disciples saw the human community as a herd that had to be ruled by a king or kings as sheep by a shepherd the athenians on the other hand believed as aristotle later said that man was a political animal endowed unlike the other animals with logos or reason and thus capable of distinguishing good from evil and of governing himself in a polis this was no trivial difference
5277152 one of the saddest observations in the study of antiquity is to see how the stoics st paul and the roman jurists all affirmed the equality of man whether free or slave and all settled down quite comfortably with the institution of slavery so did most but not all of our founding fathers
5277153 the most humiliating and infuriating part of the socratic mode of interrogation was that their ignorance was shown to be real while they felt that his self proclaimed ignorance was ostentatious and pretended the greek word eironeia from which our word irony derives meant dissembling or dissimulation saying what one did not really mean his interlocutors felt that behind his irony his veil of mock modesty socrates was laughing at them
5277154 if virtue is knowledge but knowledge is unattainable then no one can ever know any better no one is guilty and every criminal can go free
5277155 aristotles wariness about absolutes this was different from socrates and plato comes out again in his great contribution to law he was the first to formulate the concept of equity as a necessary component of any just legal system
5277156 a way to escape metaphysical and political blind alleys by combining elements of idealism with elements of what we have come to call empiricism or pragmatism

5277165 good evening miss do you have any idea why i have pulled you over
5277166 the last time you stopped me i wasnt speeding either
5277167 what is the matter with you are you just bored
5277168 take a seat in the car whilst i radio your details through to the station i am also going to have to search you and then maybe we can talk about the ticket
5277169 now how would you like to get off without even a warning
5277170 now you are free to go but i will be seeing you soon again i shall make sure of it
5277171 not now monica im running late and im losing my bloody mind god where are they
5277172 my plans i put them down and now theyre gone
5277173 no the porn magazine theyre building a new head office
5277174 i won the bid for their new building and i am supposed to the deliver the final design by noon but theyre gone the best laid plans are missing where the hell did i put them
5277175 you know what they say about the best laid plans of mice and men
5277176 no monica i dont would you care to enlighten me while i turn my office upside down
5277177 its an aphorism actually the best laid plans of mice and men
5277178 oh yes one in which the didactic moment instructs the reader as to the vagaries of life episodic intervals in which the illusion of total control gives way to an overwhelming impotence emasculation i believe is the word i am looking word
5277179 you would think theyd use the present indicative laid infers a completed action wherein even the dimmest porn aficionado turns to a porn magazine looking for the possibility of finding a lay is out of the question after all it is only a tawdry magazine then said reader will surely seek out the next best thing in the form of pleasuring of him or herself thus the logical congruence of the adjectival lay and all its future potential subjunctive form implies as in read this magazine boy if you want the best laid infers that the reader in question has already gone down the proverbial garden path if you catch my drift
5277180 it would follow then that best laid should rethink its company name as you well know a name is a critical part of any business plan look at microsoft and nike
5277181 i would sir but you know what they say about the best laid plans
5277182 no i want you to work out your ideas about changing the name of best laid
5277183 yes have them on my desk when i come back

5277195 the track looks amazing and the location is fantastic so i am really looking forward to this grand prix the team has worked hard to prepare for this race because it is a new track for all of us but from a drivers point of view the important thing is to drive it for the first time and then you can start to understand more about the circuit i enjoy going to new venues because they are a new challenge and there is always something to discover every race is unique and i like that even though this is a new track for us i know valencia pretty well from all the testing we have done at the other circuit there it is a lively city and there always seems to be something going on so it should be a fun weekend i am expecting a competitive weekend as well because at the moment we are looking quite strong scoring more points is our target and if we challenge for the podium again that would be great
5277196 im still smiling after hungary that was an incredible result and a fantastic feeling i hope it will be the first of many podiums in formula 1 the important thing was that we showed just how competitive we are at the moment and moved further ahead in fourth place in the constructors championship there is a great atmosphere in the team and we are all working hard together to move forward which is why it was so satisfying to get on the podium in hungary but valencia is a new race and we must start again i did plenty of street races when i was racing in champ cars and in that season almost all the tracks were new to me so i have learnt to adapt quickly it looks like an interesting circuit and its quite long so it should be a good show we will have plenty of work to do on friday to adjust the car to the track but we are in good form at the moment so i am optimistic for this weekend

5277200 if live nation can get to the point where its paying on parity to what the labels are paying or even below that then it will be a great strategy

5277222 this is obviously a violation of the principle of action for action essential for realizing denuclearization
5277223 exercise by bellicose forces in the u s and south korea
5277224 the u s military ignored our justifiable demand and started the joint military drills
5277225 this year will mark the first exercise with the south korean war fighting headquarters in the forefront while the united states plays a supporting role
5277226 there is no doubt if the north koreans decide to cause trouble what the outcome will be no doubt at all
5277227 the north is likely to use the joint drills as a pretext to stall the denuclearization process waiting for the next administration in washington

5277234 i thought he had won that day and i still dont like being reminded about the race
5277235 we are not sure if he is going to run yet

5277238 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5277239 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

5277243 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5277244 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5277245 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5277246 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5277247 such a show of violence is pushing kashmiri people especially our youth toward revolution
5277248 at this point i think the international community has to step in otherwise we fear a growing extremism this kind of anger comes at the worst time
5277249 i can understand from the rocket urgent urgent yao and mcgrady tracy mcgrady era has never been able to break through the first round of the playoffs curse of the situation
5277250 although headed center yao ming also agree that the team will increase the combat capability but also worried that the rocket team atmosphere may be affected
5277251 this is the player the rockets need most is my favorite type a personality mcgrady is the soft egg and yao ming are often trapped in the physical character in the east which is why the rockets are always tough but dry not a first round of the playoffs
5277252 it should be noted that the guys yao is playing with right now the chinese national team have also been known to throw some blows when things get heated on the court the team was involved in a at the 2001 asian championships in which li nan who is still playing with the national team reportedly brandished a pair of scissors yao was on the bench at the time and not involved in the fight more recently and documented with video evidence china had a good 2005 stankovic cup

5277261 the recent investment in nitol solar by ifc validates our view of nitol as one of the best positioned new entrant polysilicon producers both from a technical perspective and now with the financial means to build out their facility
5277262 we have already received sample quantities of polysilicon from nitol and are very pleased with the quality achieved
5277263 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5277264 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5277265 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5277266 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5277267 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5277268 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5277269 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5277270 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5277271 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5277272 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5277273 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5277274 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5277275 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5277276 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5277277 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5277278 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5277279 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5277280 who are open to doing something on the production side
5277281 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5277282 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5277283 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5277284 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5277285 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5277286 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5277287 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5277288 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5277289 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5277290 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5277291 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5277292 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5277293 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5277294 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5277295 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5277296 gametable online did a terrific job of creating online versions of our games

5277300 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5277301 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5277302 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5277303 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5277304 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5277305 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5277306 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5277307 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5277308 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5277309 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5277310 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5277311 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5277312 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5277313 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5277314 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5277315 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5277316 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5277317 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5277318 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5277319 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5277320 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5277321 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5277322 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5277323 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5277324 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5277325 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5277326 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5277327 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5277328 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5277329 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

5277333 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5277334 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5277335 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5277336 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5277337 the weakening economy had a dramatic impact on our results

5277345 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5277346 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5277347 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

5277459 at this point we do not have an option we will not jeopardise a pilot or the aircraft
5277460 if we were to disassemble the aircraft the only way out would be helicopter airlift
5277461 our factory will probably be more in central or eastern canada because of the favourable financial packages offered by local government
5277462 we can produce multiple hundreds of aircraft within a year including 40 elites however this is dictated by market demand
5277463 its me not you because no attractions in my view
5277464 we dont want to destroy the nato russia council but russias actions have called into question the premise of the nato russia relationship u s ambassador kurt volker said ahead of the talks
5277465 if the government wants to go in that direction we are absolutely the right organisation to support the process for doing so
5277466 one of the things we think we could do really well would be to provide entirely independent objective information for individuals to make up their own mind we think we could do that very well and would be happy to do that
5277467 one of the big dangers of allowing people to top up their treatment is that consumers arent informed and they can be susceptible in a moment of crisis to pressure from pharmaceutical companies
5277468 these drugs can be very expensive and i would welcome the provision of a source of independent reliable advice
5277469 the fact that nice are preparing to offer advice shows that the realisation is finally filtering through that you cant withhold information on good drugs which are out there and what they can do even if the nhs cant afford it
5277470 but that has got to be balanced with some sort of mechanism to make sure that people can afford access to these treatments
5277471 any information which is available is obviously valuable but people would have less need to top up if nice did not reject cancer drugs available elsewhere
5277472 it seems that the government is intent on pre empting the outcome of its own consultation on top up payments and that it wants to assist people to buy their own drugs rather than have them provided on the nhs
5277473 but labour are still avoiding two key questions if patients buy top up drugs will that prejudice their access to nhs treatment secondly why is access to new cancer medicines worse in the uk than in the rest of europe and america
5277474 we can send a wap site link within an sms but the majority of phones dont support it and people are afraid of data charges so we only do it when we have to like when users are looking for ringtones or images via sms what we find is if people initiate a conversation using sms they want to finish it using sms
5277475 over 92 percent of our searches come back with return users acceptable answers
5277476 providing answers to urgent questions related to your daily life activities
5277477 weather train bus schedules stocks news sports music leisure and a long list of places to eat shop etc
5277478 what were trying to be is essentially somebodys good friend who can answer their questions based on knowing them well the more you use our service the more we know about you the more we understand your expectation requirement your location your spending habits the more we can give you the kind of information youre looking for
5277479 if we can recognize you belong to a certain group even if you havent done certain things with this well try to give you things that are relevant to your groups profile
5277480 well do scoring of every persons activities of every search they do well help categorize them into groups the more you use it the more the individual activities affect the rankings
5277481 lets say that this person we find that he consistently goes to look for five star restaurants and plays golf and hes travelling every three or four days we can say okay next time when he says im hungry well send him a five star restaurant in the city that hes most recently travelled in for example
5277482 were minfo and medio jointly selling to some of these carriers i cant give you too much detail but we expect to see some results coming in fairly soon
5277483 shows that only 25 percent of people in china know about mobile search
5277484 78 percent said they would be interested in trying it
5277485 less than 25 percent of our searches are related to downloading mobile content if youre on the minfos wap site that portion goes up a little but when you take overall search counts downloadable is not really the biggest priority when people are searching on their phones this is quite different from most wap only search services in china where the majority of searches are for ringtones and pictures
5277486 nokia has a platform that is gaining momentum i think 40 percent of all the widget users in the world are in china so its a platform that will do well here they nokia are going to have access to a lot of users and we definitely want to make our service available to those users the widget platform just allows us to do that in way thats built into something users are already comfortable using
5277487 once theyre on your contact list theyre kind of near the top of your list and when you have a question you just click on it and you ask the question
5277488 its like a personal discussion with my search bot my personal electronic concierge
5277489 most of our competitors have focused on wap based solutions but i think most of those guys are finding things difficult in the last one to two years they had all bet on 3g and its taking a lot longer to materialize than expected
5277490 google has probably 20 percent market share and then the last 10 percent is divided between several players google and baidu both have wap presence but its not their focus for sure
5277491 in discussions with some of the leading operators to provide some wide ranging mobile search solutions
5277492 he was very impressed when we showed him how to get from his home to the office we showed which train to take and then which bus to take and he said yeah this is exactly the route i take every day
5277493 were like the mobile yellow pages provider we also sell listings for that its completely independent of our own search but a lot of our search technology goes into that mobile directory service
5277494 were distributing some of our ads and some of our content in fact we i cant really announce it but a large international company has recently signed a deal with us to distribute our mobile ads onto their network because they dont necessarily have mobile advertising inventory
5277495 a couple more so can anyone tell me if this is a leed project and thinking this might be the first leed hyatt place thanks for any info

5277510 ye call me master and lord and ye say well for so i am if i then your lord and master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one anothers feet for i have given you an example that ye should do as i have done to you verily verily i say unto you the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if ye know these things happy are ye if ye do them
5277511 ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever i command you
5277512 if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him

5277541 the eaton centre toronto retail store has been reduced to less than one half its original size as construction crews work behind the walls to overhaul the interior to the most current version
5277542 the store walls are now white painted wood instead of the usual stainless steel and the busy store is crowded with visitors
5277543 the university village seattle store is operating at half size during construction that may involve more than just an interior design make over

5277552 using email and sms as digital marketing channels has really impressed us out of the gate and shown us a clear path to offset declining response rates and poor roi in some of our other forms of advertising
5277553 the success of the secret sales proves just how effective digital marketing can be and we plan to continue to expand such programs in the future
5277554 we see great marketers achieve returns like this simply by understanding what their audience wants to receive and using the correct message type while traditional advertising is declining promotions which include contests and coupons are rapidly increasing the key is offering incentives in exchange for subscriber data and preferences then applying messaging to demographics and individual preferences digital marketing offers full end to end tracking so roi can be easily gauged
5277555 with two simple sms campaigns weve generated over 100 000 in new business our efforts with mobilestorms permission based digital messaging platform will increase and continue over time
5277556 well not only use email and text messaging as a means to drive business but in the future well also use these forms of new media as a way to effectively communicate directly with our customers
5277557 id also be remiss if i didnt take this opportunity to say how much of a pleasure it has been to interact with the mobilestorm team from pre sales demonstrations to consulting to quickly answering all of my questions at any time of the day or night to superb support mobilestorm has earned a loyal customer evangelist in me by everything that they have done to help us be successful in this space

5277586 thus far in 2008 there have been mixed signals concerning investment in travel businesses most notably weakening demand for travel and the associated high cost of oil has not been reflected in the appetite of venture capital investors who remain bullish on the long term prospects of the online travel value proposition
5277587 while not all of our earlier predictions for 2008 have yet materialized many of the trends we predicted have been realized in the activity weve witnessed in the first half of the year

5277852 i did my undergraduate and graduate work at the university of ibadan nigeria i now teach an array of courses in african and the african diaspora postcolonial non european literature in english world literature and american ethnic lives
5277853 talking quilting and burial grounds beyond memory progress and paradise in gloria naylors mama day
5277854 the equation between the african character in selected african diaspora writing
5277855 paths of convergence african diaspora paradigm in toni morrisons beloved and isidore okpewhos call me by my rightful name
5277856 creative visions migrant voices re configuration and unification of the african diaspora in selected continental african literature
5277857 my recent creative works include esilokun ojime which i wrote for toni morrison to mark her 70th birthday
5277858 native conveys the notion of an essential african consciousness sensitivity and awareness daughter conveys the empowered position of african womanhood the objective is not to create a romantic portraiture of africa but to attempt a realistic perception in which africa is a paradox of good and bad sadness and immense joy wealth and poverty sickness and health and above all to show the beauty that lies beneath the picture of hunger disease and poverty favoured by the western eye
5277859 the returning native daughter turns new eyes that penetrate through the sordid to show and voice the beauty strength ability to survive immense odds and the unconditional love and caring in film narration and poetry the journal will capture africa from the creative sensitive eyes like the sunlight that often shines through the rain signifying tears and joy osita you are a writer and pretty good published poet yourself so you understand these concepts subjects and themes as do many others here and abroad
5277860 the final product will be a visual and voiced journal presentation of visual images in two formats cd and book length collection of poetry tentatively titled journeys return of a native daughter
5277861 moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven days
5277862 but the fearful and unbelieving shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone
5277863 en un principio las im genes de piedra nos llenaron de asombro porque no pod amos comprender c mo estas gentes que carec an de madera fuerte y pesada para construir cualquier tipo de maquinaria as como de sogas resistentes hab an conseguido no obstante erigir unas im genes semejantes que al menos ten an 10 metros de alto y eran proporcionalmente gruesas
5277864 de ninguna manera se puede admitir que tan enormes trozos de lava hayan sido despejados con primitivas y diminutas hachas de piedra
5277865 cosmonautas de otro mundo visitaron a los nativos y les suministraron herramientas perfeccionadas que pod an manejar los sacerdotes o hechiceros
5277866 el gran fallo de cuantos han intentado explicar el traslado de los moais de forma convencional aparece al echar mano de la madera
5277867 era el poder m s excepcional del rey o de los sacerdotes el que levantaba las estatuas en la cantera desplaz ndolas por el aire
5277868 escog an siempre una roca en plano inclinado en la misma roca tallaban la escultura perforaban despu s la piedra por debajo de la estatua con tantos agujeros como fueran necesarios para separarla de la roca y la hac an resbalar sobre la pendiente hasta el lugar en que deb a erigirse donde hab an ahondado lo suficiente para enterrar la parte inferior de la estatua quedando s lo el busto al exterior
5277869 following this topic closely will drive a normal person insane but it makes perfect sense to me
5277870 i love the sun and im always out in it given the chance however when its hot i always keep in the shade and keep well covered having just come back from visiting family in india i made sure that my 4 year old daughter was wearing full sleeve bamboo t shirts and leggings all day long this amazing fabric not only kept her cool but it also has uv protective qualities for the skin that is exposed just apply a small amount of green people or essential care
5277871 avoid any ingredient that can irritate the skin and all unnecessary synthetic chemicals
5277872 strong accumulating evidence suggesting that the rise in eczema and the increased use of such products are linked
5277873 would have to show that defendants rejected the challenged courses to punish religious viewpoints rather than out of rational concern about the academic merit of those religious viewpoints
5277874 the question the university addresses in reviewing courses is not whether they have religious content but whether they provide adequate instruction in the subject matter
5277875 we also evaluate whether or not they promote the analytical and critical thinking skills necessary to succeed at the university our decisions are made based on the academic merits of the course
5277876 if the scripture verses that begin each chapter were removed the textbook would likely be approved
5277877 agreed with the analyses of experts who found the textbooks academically inadequate
5277878 it appears that uc is attempting to secularize private religious schools
5277879 science courses from a religious perspective are not approved if it comes from certain publishers or from a religious perspective uc simply denies them
5277880 its all about the social engineering from government the universities have to respond
5277881 its a pretty good offer its basically just cutting the tuition fees isnt it
5277882 encourage good students to come people with grades like yours we need more of them
5277883 trying to lift themselves through the league tables and they are like a football team paying to attract new talent
5277884 the shift towards a market in higher education is inevitably bringing about a consumer culture
5277885 web publishers have few viable options when it comes to affordable enterprise level video publishing solutions that include deep out of the box social media functionality
5277886 this solution offers a simplified way to build players and monetize content with an efficient workflow that is made available through akamai re hopeful to remove the final barriers to adoption by making available a highly sophisticated video publishing platform to web publishers of all sizes
5277887 and now it appears that people taking antidepressants who also have relatively higher depression scores fare significantly worse when attempting to perform a computerized simulation of driving
5277888 and i wouldnt want to instill fear in drivers but i think that perhaps individuals who are taking these medications should just be aware of the fact that they may cause concentration problems and impair reaction time
5277889 this issue is not just a question for drivers because the cognitive skills needed for driving are also needed for a lot of other skills
5277890 there is already a very deep literature about subtle impairments of higher cognitive function associated with clinical depression itself apart from medications
5277891 i would add that in any case medication package inserts routinely warn patients about a whole host of issues when starting a course of psychotropic drugs including warning against the handling of machinery driving or engaging in any occupation in which you can be injured so to that extent this concern isnt new
5277892 we were basically stuck up the canyon without our rafts

5277898 until they are six months old infants lack a blood brain barrier to prevent blood borne toxins entering the brain low level exposures that would have little or no effect on an adult brain can sabotage a foetal one
5277899 newborn skin is relatively more permeable to topically applied agents than adult skin therefore the risk of systemic toxicity is much greater in newborns
5277900 some detergents can break down the skins natural barrier so that it allows other irritants and allergens such as house dust mites to penetrate and if you took away such factors as harsh shampoos and bubble baths for babies and children you could prevent vast numbers of children being affected by eczema
5277901 from the day they are conceived our children are exposed to a soup of chemicals most of which would not have existed when our grandmothers were in the womb
5277902 there are he says around 70 000 chemicals currently in commercial use with about 1 000 new ones added each year to test just the commonest 1 000 toxic chemicals in unique combinations of three would require at least 166m experiments ignoring the need to study varying doses in other words we really dont know what all these chemicals may be doing in our childrens bodies
5277903 most of these chemicals cross the placenta or may be passed to the newborn via breast milk
5277904 there is no excusing vladimir putins bloody invasion of georgia
5277905 the united states has been pushing the buttons of russian frustration and paranoia by moving ever further into moscows former sphere of influence and we have rarely stopped to consider whether we were overreaching even as evidence mounted that the patience of a wealthier and more assertive russia was wearing very thin

5278003 after my first patient died i remember getting this sick feeling in the pit of my stomach when i saw the janitor role down the corridor i looked across the hall at a nurse who simultaneously shuddered and looked away we could not watch as his living things were bagged and tossed away as his room was raped
5278004 recently i came across one of the saddest passages ive ever read writer augusten burroughs writes in his new book the wolf at the table a memoir of my father about growing up with his distant neglectful father one part in particular was so raw as to make me almost cringe as i read it

5278020 we still have a lot of time and from my experience a lot of deals are finalised close to the end of the window so we will see

5278022 we believe this groundbreaking partnership will bring the action of manchester united direct to our many fans in saudi arabia
5278023 what is going on when one of the most reputable journals in the field of philosophy isnt given anywhere near the kind of respect that it deserves
5278024 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5278025 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5278026 i hope he intends to honor the pledge this time
5278027 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces or people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5278028 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5278029 i think we just have to work with our allies and above all we need to look at what russia does from here on in terms of the severity of whatever measures would be considered
5278030 my hope is that their actions in the weeks and months ahead will provide some reassurance that these actions in georgia are an aberration and not symptomatic of a new approach by russia to the rest of the world and to their neighbors that looks a lot like the old soviet union
5278031 according to a survey into social attitudes 50 7 of people think that couples who have lived together for a while have the same rights as married or civil partners and that a common law marriage has recognised legal status they also wrongly believe that by having a child together they acquire legal rights

5278037 there is obviously more work to do on this we need a much larger study but there certainly seems to be some sort of link
5278038 i think people who are depressed especially those on anti depressants should be aware of this if they are driving or doing anything that relies on concentration and reaction skills
5278039 assessments are done on a case by case basis we would urge anyone who feels their driving is impaired by a medical condition to contact us
5278040 depression can effect people in many different ways but one of the common symptoms is experiencing difficulty concentrating

5278045 our findings show ssws lives are dominated by an unrelenting cycle of selling sex buying drugs and then using them
5278046 this suggests they are unlikely to be able to just stop working even if the risks of punishment are increased street sex markets and the ssws poor health are the product of complex and interrelated factors and if anything these approaches will make ssws wary of contact with the police and push the women underground making them more vulnerable to violence and difficult for support services to reach
5278047 our research indicates that improvement of drug services would reduce the need to score and use drugs which is likely to reduce time spent working as well as contact with drug dealers and other users if this was linked to addressing accommodation needs and supporting contact with children then the majority of pressures forcing the women back into the cycle would also be addressed

5278055 ensure sustainable access availability and affordability of quality food to all nigerians and increase nigerias foreign exchange earnings as nigeria would become a significant net provider of food to the global community
5278056 make nigeria a significant net provider of food to the global community through private sector driven large scale commercial farming storage processing and market development
5278057 current global food crisis is an economic opportunity for developing countries especially nigeria
5278058 nigerias highly diversified agro ecological condition which makes the production of a wide range of agricultural products possible
5278059 is estimated that about 75 per cent 68 million ha of the total land area has potential for agricultural activities with about 33 million ha under cultivation similarly of the estimated 3 14 million ha irrigable land area only about 220 000 ha 7 is utilised
5278060 in doing this all previous attempts to address food security and agricultural development from the farm settlement centres of the 1950s to the various recent presidential initiatives were reviewed
5278061 when you want to champion the african green revolution we have gone over and above our own product which is fertilizer but rather understanding the value chain and eliminating all the bottlenecks to ensuring that the food gets from the farmers to the consumers in the right manner at the right price
5278062 nigeria and indeed sub saharan africa has the lowest fertilizer utilisation per hectare per annum in the world in which we have people that are extremely poor and hungry the situation would soon change for the better when notore begins production
5278063 starvation is at its highest in this part of the world and that is because we are not capable of feeding ourselves nigeria has the lowest utilisation of fertilizer in the world in nigeria a farmer is using about 8 10kg of fertilizer per hectate per annum when best practices should be as high as 200kg per hectare per annum
5278064 some countries actually use about 300kg hectare annum there is a link between increase in crop output and the application of fertilizer notores major goal is to help fix that problem and that is why we maintain that our company is championing the african green revolution by making high grade inputs available so with key inputs as fertilizer and fertilizer respondent seeds which guarantee multiple planting seasons as well as increase in total crop output per annum and crop protection products which help in ensuring that the rodents do not destroy your farm we believe we hold the key to africas green revolution
5278065 acquired the assets of the former nafcon in onne rivers state we have been through a two and half year refurbishment process and from september this year will start producing fertilizer first for nigeria and for the rest of africa we are going to be producing mpk and urea which i am sure everybody knows that these are the most responded fertilizers or one of the responding core to fertilizer
5278066 sales of our products that we would have very good customers among the right farmers
5278067 musharraf would not be going to the united states this asylum is an issue that is not on the table
5278068 after viewing the situation and consulting legal advisers and poltical allies with their advice i have decided to resign i leave my future in the hands of people not a single charge in the impeachment can stand against me no charge can be proved against me because i never did anything for myself it was all for pakistan on the map of the world pakistan is now an important country by the grace of allah whether i win or lose the impeachment the nation will lose they dont realize they can succeed against me but the country will undergo irreparable damage my resignation will go to the speaker of the national assembly today

5278122 we have plans in place to protect our customers and associates to keep them
5278123 we always carry a lot of batteries flashlights and extra bottles of water for these type of emergencies
5278124 but its really hard to tell what the customer is going to do

5278133 i do more drinking at home now than at the pubs theyre more for special occasions since its becoming so expensive
5278134 brewing is a major industry beer our national drink and pubs a treasured part of our national culture
5278135 sadly the trade repeatedly shows that it cannot be relied upon to consistently act in a responsible way
5278136 this would reduce the percentage of students who engage in suicidal thinking who contemplate how to make an attempt and who continue to make attempts
5278137 the tradition is to despise games as a brain drain type of thing
5278138 our teachers were taught and still are taught to lecture to cover the material
5278139 instead of mutual respect teachers dis the kids saying games contribute to a short attention span that theyre a waste of time thats not true
5278140 their attitude toward teachers is why should i learn from you its an atmosphere of mutual disrespect
5278141 this is a very clear example of kids knowing more than teachers
5278142 failure to connect how computers affect our childrens minds and what we can do about it
5278143 the main question is whether the activity whatever it is is educationally valid and contributes significantly to whatever is being studied
5278144 the point is not whether kids are playing with learning or what medium they are playing in a ball field or a wii setup or a physics lab or art studio but rather why they are doing it
5278145 just because it is electronic does not make it any better and it may turn out not to be as valuable
5278146 were not trying to get kids to consume more technology were trying to get them producing new technology and with technology producing new knowledge

5278158 youd like to screen people youd like to screen their luggage youd like to screen packages and ship containers
5278159 youd also like to detect these improvised explosive devices that have been showing up all over but particularly in iraq
5278160 where vehicles could drive down the street at a reasonable speed and screen for these explosives
5278161 not just explosives but we can tell which explosives they are
5278162 the case focused on hundreds of people who had no choice but to live in nursing facilities

5278193 to sit in the shade on a fine day and look upon verdure is the most perfect refreshment
5278194 besides the noble art of getting things done there is a nobler art of leaving things undone the wisdom of life consists in the elimination of nonessentials

5278196 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama

5278198 the audience embraces it because they relate to the people involved who they care about

5278217 what they had most in common was a hatred of moral relativism they both believed that morality is absolute though they defined and applied it differently but each believed with all his hear brain and soul that there were such things as moral right and moral wrong and that these were not subject to changes in fashion moral relativism was in fact the gravest of sins everything else they believed in common flowed from this basic perception even their seemingly opposite lives were dedicated to the same cause fighting against the future they both saw clearly that what was coming would be worse than what was now understanding that the dictators of their own time were harbingers of a world unlinked to faith or tradition or common sense or decency

5278219 these lakes were rediscovered within the past 10 years or so but no one yet has penetrated them and we want to make sure that the research is done properly and adheres to the highest environmental stewardship principles
5278220 this has the potential to be one of the most important scientific discoveries in years since sub ice water appears to be an important player in many different processes fundamental to antarctica and our planet
5278221 we believe that these lakes are part of an interconnected system that spans the entire antarctic continent
5278222 these bodies of water are several miles beneath the ice sheet which took millions of years to form meaning these lakes have been undisturbed and disconnected from our atmosphere for hundreds of thousands of years it is highly likely that unique microbial communities that we never knew existed are lake residents
5278223 how to do this in the best way to preserve these environments and to be least invasive is a key question that needs further discussion
5278224 the countries involved have all agreed we must do as much as possible to avoid altering the lakes or causing any environmental damage
5278225 it is highly likely that unique microbial communities that we never knew existed are lake residents
5278226 once the u s becomes fully engaged in these research efforts this will almost certainly be one of the dominant antarctic research focus areas for at least the next decade if not longer

5278240 i like the pool the playground the tennis courts and i have all different kinds of friends

5278242 im very pleased that the only area in the entire richmond region named to the money magazine list was here in chesterfield county midlothian is a great place when you look at the combination of history preservation and growth making it a terrific story of economic development
5278243 its on our web site we refer to it when were talking with prospects or sending out information we use national rankings such as this to promote the county
5278244 in combination with the other virginia localities named on the list it keeps virginia front and center with those seeking to relocate from a retirement standpoint or with those choosing to relocate a business

5278249 we have regular loyal customers but we also have a lot of tourists and out of towners come through because quilters will come off the beaten path to visit a good quilt shop
5278250 in saluting midlothian you have to give the people who developed sycamore square 30 years ago credit its a great place to work and shop thanks to what sycamore square started and the vmvc has focused on were getting more and more fun shops and restaurants in the village
5278251 midlothian has always had a defining image that goes beyond just being another bedroom community to richmond it seems when you have that defining image then community pride will stay strong which results in citizens re investing in the community with volunteer time festivals school support athletic leagues etc this community pride and citizen participation is what makes midlothian a great place to live

5278278 of course wed have wished for a slightly better result than places three and four at our home race but the two peugeots couldnt be beaten here the team and the drivers achieved the maximum and kept the title fight open this means that well be seeing a thrilling finale at silverstone
5278279 it was a good race for rocky and me we were both quick even in traffic you can see that weve learned a lot since the beginning of the season unfortunately we had no chance against the peugeots nevertheless we still have hopes for the championship weve only got a two point gap to marc gen and nicolas minassian well do everything we can at silverstone to clinch the title
5278280 in terms of speed we wanted to be closer to our team mates and we managed that we drove similar lap times so were very satisfied in that respect at the previous races we were still lacking something we know its difficult against peugeot but weve still been making maximum use of the potential for audi so far we want to do that at silverstone as well and decide the championship in our favour
5278281 that was a really tough weekend for us my first stint in the race was terrible i had no grip whatsoever i cant remember ever having fought so hard with the r10 the second stint was a bit better but in the third stint i again had absolutely no feeling for the car we need to find out what was wrong and solve the problem before silverstone so that we can drive a great season finale there
5278282 we already had problems with our car in qualifying unfortunately they continued in the race the car was inconsistent dindo capello and i both had the same feeling still we were able to move forwards up to third place at times
5278283 it was a pretty uneventful race the peugeots were able to fully play out their advantage in the first two hours they saddled us with a lap before the situation became a little more balanced we saw a nice fight among our two cars positions kept changing but then alex pr mat had a slow puncture he had to pit a little earlier but fortunately late enough so that this didnt mean an extra stop the other car had also a slow puncture just before the end of the race apparently there was a lot of debris on the track too bad that this caused dindo and allan to miss the podium again but well make up for that at silverstone
5278284 from 1973 to 1990 the united states sold saddam hussein more than a quarter of his weapons
5278285 you could hear her going on and on because she was standing right behind the stage curtain
5278286 shes talking and talking meanwhile you have the entire audience waiting almost two hours for the taping to start
5278287 she leaves us waiting and everyone is sitting there complaining and then she comes out and doesnt say a word about it she didnt even say hello she got right into her script
5278288 tyra kept saying when i was a model and would hardly let them talk
5278289 she had the audience prance down the street and then release black balloons some were whining that it was so bad for the environment

5278294 the west is facing the most serious financial crisis since the second world war
5278295 i know that i dont walk alone and i know that if i can get myself out of the way that i can maybe carry out in some small way what he intends
5278296 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5278297 i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5278298 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5278299 ok we dont have to go longer on that one
5278300 i think my faith is strong enough and my marriage is strong enough that i can afford those civil rights to others even if i have a different perspective
5278301 we paid a lot to come here and bring them
5278302 were not bringing in contraband drugs evil stuff were just bringing in bibles
5278303 the bible doesnt speak against any of that they even admitted the bible was a good book
5278304 while phyllis adored her garden we are certain that she would prefer in lieu of flowers donations be made
5278305 i shall write to our houses that your charity is growing old and that like your godfather st john you can speak of nothing but love
5278306 my daughter do not make such a comparison for we must not profane the saints by comparing them to poor sinners but you will do me a pleasure if you tell those sisters that if i went by my own feelings if i followed my inclination and if i were not afraid of wearying the sisters i should never speak of anything but charity and i assure you i scarcely ever open my mouth to speak of holy things without having a mind to say thou shalt love the lord with thy whole heart and thy neighbour as thyself
5278307 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
5278308 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
5278309 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
5278310 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
5278311 he was a genuine american original and he will be missed by his friends which has to be about a million people
5278312 and by the time they left they were best friends
5278313 once jack starts to tell a story its hard to get him to stop
5278314 the purpose of denver stories is to honor those individuals who have done the most for denver and i cant imagine anyone more interesting or exciting than jack
5278315 he was one of a kind a fellow hoosier and lived a life full and amazing
5278316 theres plenty of theater made by young people at the fringe most of it receives less attention than it deserves and some of it obviously aims to educate the performers as much as delight
5278317 heres a school show though from the denver school of the arts in colorado that pulls off the rare achievement of bringing 40 young people aged 14 17 on stage showing off some impressive performing skills and offering the audience a truly substantial and moving glimpse into the mind of the generation now trembling on the cusp of adulthood
5278318 over a brisk 70 minutes director shawn hanns young cast move through sketches based on
5278319 on top of that they have to deal with all the normal pains of adolescence from broken friendships to unrequited love their three minute
5278320 the content is terrific the staging excellent and the quality of performance truly moving and if these magnificent funny angry humble self aware kids speak for the whole of their generation then theres some hope for the future after all
5278321 i think what were looking at is a tycoon team if you will people with the resources and vision for a new energy economy
5278322 its time for the wealthiest of the country to lead in solving the carbon crisis
5278323 if they can come together on climate change and pool their intellectual resources their financial resources and their own teams of people they have managing their empires what a critical mass that would be and what a voice it would be
5278324 this is a combination of a symposium and a renewable energy street fair and multimedia presentation
5278325 its a fabulous concentration most venues dont bring all of that together
5278326 what do you expect me to just start eating at mcdonalds all the time
5278327 you get paid 160 000 you can afford applebees you dont even have to stoop so low as to eat at mcdonalds
5278328 some in the crowd were seen raising their eyebrows as obama the man who touts himself from the south side of chicago critiqued the popular food chain
5278329 it means that those sins that i have on a fairly regular basis hopefully will be washed away
5278330 and i thought well 24 actually a lot of our constituents probably do eat at mcdonalds so that wouldnt be such a bad thing
5278331 return to your wife and daughters and your country and youre able to be a provider a father and a husband in the best sense of all those terms
5278332 if you want to see your kindergartners again put hamdan and our other brothers on a flight to freedom
5278333 the position by conservative leader david cameron has been considerably more robust
5278334 the principles that georgian sovereign territory have been violated that russian forces should leave and the disrespect for international law have all been pointed out by cameron
5278335 has been noticeable by his absence from the georgia debate and lack of leadership
5278336 i think eu president and french president sarkozy has been taking the lead and nato has been hampered taking something of a back seat and we are witnessing a weakness in nato at the present time
5278337 i think you are seeing a weakness inside of nato because of afghanistan and a feeling that it didnt step up to the plate in afghanistan so the eu is seen as balancing if not usurping the traditional role of nato in a crisis like georgia
5278338 i wouldnt be alive today but for the personal courage of john mccain
5278339 it was long ago and far away in a prison camp in north vietnam my father was a high ranking admiral the vietnamese came and said that i could leave prison early and we had a code of conduct that said you only leave by order of capture i also had a dear and beloved friend who was from california by the name of ed alvarez who had been shot down and captured a couple years before me but i wasnt in good physical shape in fact i was in rather bad physical shape
5278340 so i said no now in interest of full disclosure im very happy i didnt know the war was going to last for another three years or so but i said no and ill never forget the high ranking officer who offered it slammed the door and the interrogator said go back to your cell its going to be very tough on you now and it was but it was not only the toughest decision i ever made but im most happy about that decision than any decision ive ever made in my life it took a lot of prayer it took a lot of prayer
5278341 i think that rich is should be defined by a home a good job and education and the ability to hand to our children a more prosperous and safer world than the one that we inherited
5278342 well i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5278343 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies thats my commitment thats my commitment to you
5278344 i think my faith is strong enough and my marriage is strong enough that i can afford those civil rights to others even if i have a different perspective or a different view
5278345 if a federal court decided that my state of arizona had to observe what the state of massachusetts decided then i would favor a constitutional amendment
5278346 you know by a strange coincidence i was not elected miss congeniality in the united states senate this year
5278347 and by the way if you hadnt noticed we now have a pro american president of france which proves if you live long enough anything can happen in america
5278348 two great hitters im going to get them up there more often if i can
5278349 russia can have at its borders only vassals or enemies
5278350 poland by deploying the anti missile system is exposing itself to a nuclear strike 100 percent
5278351 needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state georgia
5278352 profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally with russia and with nato
5278353 my record is catering towards the mature hip hop fan the kids might be able to get with it but it aint just playing it aint just partying its reality to me this album
5278354 i am not questioning the veracity of anything you just said to me i would absolutely have no reason to do that but until the state of arizona lifts its no bond status its a no bond status at this point
5278355 live nation benefits from the difficulty of replicating the live experience that casual and passionate fans pay for in good times or bad
5278356 started with control of the venues then used that to spread out into other areas of the music industry and by so doing its competing with the record labels
5278357 if live nation can get to the point where its paying on parity to what the labels are paying or even below that then it will be a great strategy
5278358 madonna is not getting paid 120 million upfront the money is getting paid out over ten years and thats only if she performs

5278365 its the radiocarbon date that to our minds is like a square peg in a round hole its not fitting properly and the question is why
5278366 there is a lot of other evidence that suggests to many that the shroud is older than the radiocarbon dates allow and so further research is certainly needed
5278367 only by doing this will people be able to arrive at a coherent history of the shroud which takes into account and explains all of the available scientific and historical information
5278368 hes had other ideas but theyve all been shot down and this one will be shot down too
5278369 right now i dont have the best understanding of it
5278370 this system is very detailed its difficult to pick up and theyve thrown a lot at me thats the most frustrating thing there is so much offense that you want to learn but if you dont have a great understanding or feel for it it can show in your play

5278375 the reason this scandal was as devastating as it was was there wasnt transparency in the beginning not because they were coddling criminals although that was the impact
5278376 the church with all its wonderful qualities one of its not so wonderful qualities is its adherence to secrecy which has certainly contributed to the problem
5278377 i think in the studies that i read after 2002 i came to that conclusion for the first time
5278378 all those formed in my mind the conviction that the recidivism rate was too great to ever chance allowing someone to recommit this crime
5278379 this is something that i have to live with because its a terrible crime and it was on my watch
5278380 while its a milestone on one hand the road ahead is very long
5278381 holding bishops accountable how lawsuits helped the catholic church confront clergy sexual abuse
5278382 the cardinals rhetoric about protecting victims and showing compassion to perpetrators and pastoral concern for incarcerated priests omits the theme on peoples minds
5278383 that theme is what is the institutional church going to do to hold officials accountable
5278384 history has shown that very little changes the behavior of the hierarchy
5278385 but history has also shown that exposing secrets does protect kids prompts victims to come forward and prods catholics and citizens to look at religious figures with a much healthier skepticism
5278386 real change could come about if the cardinal demoted church officials who concealed abuse
5278387 hes a man who takes time to think things through
5278388 it will never contribute more than a fraction of our needs
5278389 i thank the people of guam for making their voices heard and standing up for change

5278395 we are confident we have everything in place to put the pools back where it belongs at the heart of football in this country
5278396 if we were to make new constellation in todays night sky how would we decide what they would be
5278397 in fact there was no meaning to it or no story to it it was just about showing the data
5278398 thats a very fun playful thing to look at and a lot of people like it but for me its not really that interesting because there is no story there there is no secret that is being revealed its just eye candy basically its designed with no content
5278399 i think about it now as i am older i think of data visualization as just another tool that i can use to help tell stories really beautifully you have to have the story to begin with

5278401 ecb chief executive davd collier was at the meeting and he will report back
5278402 they have a board meeting in london on tuesday to discuss the issue
5278403 the meeting lasted two hours and it was an opportunity for all the players to ask whatever questions they had about the tournament
5278404 david collier and hugh morris managing director of the england team were both there and they heard the views of all the players
5278405 they will report back to the ecb board on tuesday but i dont know when a decision is going to be announced
5278406 yes i have resigned from the post and it is now the prerogative of the new president of the country to appoint a new chairman of the pakistan cricket board pcb
5278407 i will continue to work until a new chairman is appointed and i dont see my leaving affecting the champions trophy because pcb is an institution and institutions are not run by individuals
5278408 im now convinced that a large segment of the charismatic church will follow the anti christ when he shows up because they have no discernment
5278409 this is a ceremony celebrating the formal apostolic alignment of todd bentley
5278410 something they discovered in the bible that no one has ever noticed
5278411 i realized i had become a sort of a guru about what one needs to do to make a house into a healthy home so i started allergybuyers com to sell helpful products to people like me
5278412 i have always been most interested in the green aspects of what we were doing at allergy buyers and that really goes back a very long way in my history
5278413 forty five years ago i had solar panels on my house in england my family were environmentalists before anybody ever really used the term
5278414 we have products that if people use them can actually make an impact on the world in a positive way its very exciting to conceive of a business where youre making a profit and a difference at the same time
5278415 we still focus on home products but the impact on the greater community is enormous
5278416 its amazing how something so simple can make such a difference and save so much money too
5278417 the kinds of things that ive been living my life around in my home environment suddenly became more interesting to the outside world
5278418 but its like wow its taken everyone 35 years to get it thats like half a lifetime
5278419 they are the biggest marketing ploy that has ever been hoisted on the american public they should be banned
5278420 they take a thousand years to degrade in a landfill buy a reusable water bottle its so simple to put a water filter on your tap if the water tastes bad
5278421 we like to choose products that make life better but also dont ask the consumer to do anything special or unique to help conserve electricity or water or you name it
5278422 most of our products if youre a lazy person are a no brainer
5278423 so if youre going to paint a room for 20 you could save a whole lot of money
5278424 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5278425 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5278426 the same old folks that brought you george w bush
5278427 john mccain has never questioned sen obamas patriotism but he clearly does question sen obamas experience and judgment
5278428 there is an urgency for youth to get involved with these things now more than ever to get involved and dedicate themselves to world issues to try to change the world
5278429 everyone brought welcome knowledge that was overwhelmingly encouraging and very informative
5278430 by yourself i find its hard to change but in a group you can come together and make one great event
5278431 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5278432 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5278433 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know

5278440 one of the most important ways of positioning on global warming is to emphasize the jobs issue since it appeals to people who you might not otherwise reach with your message
5278441 the call to sacrifice for the nations greater good remains an imperative of citizenship sadly in recent years in the midst of a war on two fronts this call to service never came after 9 11 we were asked to shop
5278442 plenty of recent media polls demonstrate that drilling for more american oil particularly offshore drilling has the potential to be a very effective wedge issue for republicans as a way to reduce the price of gas
5278443 for the immediate short term right now forcing house democrats to vote on drilling offshore and in wilderness areas or exposing their refusal to hold this vote would be a potentially strong wedge issue that would split the democrats win among independents and excite the republicans
5278444 the republican echo chamber has done a great job on this
5278445 this intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very future of our nation
5278446 the energy crisis is real it is worldwide it is a clear and present danger to our nation these are the facts and we must face them
5278447 thou shalt not talk honestly to the american people about sacrifice
5278448 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion
5278449 i got the impression that littlemore was engaging in the debate totally unprepared
5278450 oh my this is very confusing no wonder the government says its too early to take action
5278451 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
5278452 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
5278453 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community

5278456 making up your mind questions to consider before the next election
5278457 heres what i want you to do between now and election
5278458 dont just look at issues look at character issues are important but you also have to look at character
5278459 theyre saying im totally self sufficient in myself and nobodys self sufficient enough to be president its too big a job
5278460 rick warren is at the forefront of a kind of younger generation of evangelical protestant leaders who want to have a christian public presence in the culture but who are less tied to the republican politics of their predecessors
5278461 theyre values oriented guys but less convinced that either their own principles or the best politics lies in a total commitment to the republican party
5278462 we are one of those people that make over 250 000 a year and i dont agree that that makes us rich
5278463 even with that kind of income we struggle to pay everything we have gotten ourselves into
5278464 im pretty much a dyed in the wool republican and i was a marine what he went through for five years you gotta hand that to him
5278465 i mean come on whoever buys into that they gotta have a screw loose
5278466 just stay in the senate stay busy learn more foreign policy and come back in ten years obama and i betcha id vote for you
5278467 hes as genuine as can be its just hes a green apple hanging on the tree and mccain is a ripe red apple ready to be picked obama just needs to ripen some more
5278468 barack obama is going to get the same percentage of the religious vote that john kerry and al gore got
5278469 thats christian identity politics and im sure it has some influence but i dont think at the end of the day its the deciding factor
5278470 jimmy carter could have come in here and sounded much more comfortable with his faith but people having seen a jimmy carter presidency would not vote for him just because theyre likely to see him in heaven
5278471 study all the different candidates at every different level you need to register to vote and then you need to vote
5278472 when i hear people say i dont like either of the candidates im just not going to vote i want to say to them well then you need to move to another country because people died for that vote

5278478 the companys current business models root were developing commercial biological technologies and solutions for the chemical industry in the marketplace we became aware of the growing trends towards sustainable eco efficient solutions using renewable resources we saw a real need and opportunity for the next wave after the use of ethanol as an alternative fuels for bio renewable chemicals there is a strong demand and interest for renewable packaging solutions wal mart market news for example has initiated and pioneered a very strong sustainability initiative that focuses on reducing packaging and adherence to sustainable practices
5278479 we went about developing partners and providers in the supply chain to deliver bio renewable chemicals we met cosan sa market news approximately a year ago cosan is the worlds largest processor of sugarcane ethanol which happens to be 7 8 times more efficient than corn feedstock has significantly less carbon impact and is not a competing food source
5278480 we anticipate revenues shortly and are in process of negotiating final agreements

5278482 one of the first online investor resources providing in depth information on renewable energy greentech and water sectors
5278483 i know but you never know what will happen after this right its not lik
5278484 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5278485 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5278486 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5278487 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5278488 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5278489 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5278490 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5278491 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5278492 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5278493 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5278494 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5278495 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5278496 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5278497 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5278498 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5278499 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
5278500 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5278501 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5278502 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5278503 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5278504 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5278505 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
5278506 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
5278507 the democrats talk of tolerance but in reality the only tolerance they ever exhibit is for their own intellectual arrogance and they dont have tolerance for my culture
5278508 they think were a bunch of hillbilly heathens who go out and burn crosses and do crazy bullshit
5278509 they dont give a f if were with them or not because it doesnt matter the f ing republicans have stolen the individual liberties thing and thats why the gun thing is such a big deal
5278510 i got a call from them right after johnny got out i never heard back
5278511 sometimes they remind me of another bunch from chicago the blues brothers they seem to think theyre on a mission from god
5278512 if thats how he runs his campaign he is going to lose id rather bet on those who voted before when he stands up and says that im gonna get 30 per cent more black voters im gonna get 30 per cent more of my people to turn out for me what is joe six pack thinking
5278513 instead of all the high falutin exhortation about listening to the better angels mr obama has gotta come out here and time is short and emphasise social justice
5278514 he should say im a black guy im not gonna take the michael jackson treatment but the problems of south side chicago are the same problems of the appalachian mountains big sonsofabitches are kicking the little sonsofabitches in the ass now im one of the little sonsofabitches so im pissed off inside every rural republican is a rural democrat begging to get out but we always trip over our johnsons
5278515 think this election will be won on the internet but here at 5 30 in the afternoon they dont go on the goddamn internet they go watch the andy griffith show a 1960s sitcom
5278516 white people in the south and throughout the appalachians love black culture i mean southern style cooking is black food everything i eat is fried your swing vote in the appalachians comes down to common sense thinking people who have strong faith and what barack obama needs to do is embrace his culture because we like his culture but nobody knows anything about him over 10 per cent of the rednecks out here and im a redneck think hes a muslim cause nobodys ever told em any different
5278517 im pretty sure i aint a queer and ive never had queer thoughts
5278518 but god loves them queers every bit that he loves the republicans
5278519 its their mouth they can use it to haul coal if they want to
5278520 the gallant kids from around here who lost their lives
5278521 it is the same exact people its the same f ing bunch of fight sing drink pray people who are over there who are over here in these mountains
5278522 youre damn right theyre on hadrians side of the wall is where they are and they want the scots irish vote well its true its f ing genes its who we are as a people well say f you to bush longshanks or maggie thatcher f any of em
5278523 im here to advocate for sen obama that we get a democrat into the wh
5278524 reporters are grumbling more and more that the campaign is acting like the prom queen they gripe that it is arrogant and control ling and the campaigns own belief that obama is poised to make history isnt endearing either the press certainly helped obama get so far so fast the question is how far can he get if his campaign alienates them
5278525 end of the affair barack obama and the press break up
5278526 the problem is not that democrats are monolithically pro choice or anti school prayer its that by dropping the class language that once distinguished them sharply from republicans they have left themselves vulnerable to cultural wedge issues like guns and abortion and the rest whose hallucinatory appeal would ordinarily be overshadowed by material concerns we are in an environment where republicans talks constantly about class in a coded way to be sure but where democrats are afraid to bring it up
5278527 wij hebben de afgelopen maanden erg veel ge nvesteerd in de optimalisatie van onze service en logistiek wij zijn daarom ook erg trots dat dit zijn vruchten begint af te werpen
5278528 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5278529 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5278530 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5278531 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5278532 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
5278533 we want young chinese girls or boys to get such an impression from this place that 20 years from now theyll want to work for johnson amp johnson
5278534 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
5278535 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
5278536 hey mister if you dont get those ads off the air in the next 48 hours then your military record and my military record are going to become a major issue in this campaign youve invited it and if you insist on permitting this stuff to continue then its going to be an issue
5278537 i know what im going into here for one thing im black ive got a feisty wife you know i mean we all know what theyre going to try to do here
5278538 look its just a continuation of what ive been doing a very positive approach that so far seems to have done what i hoped it would do and anyway thats the kind of guy i am so well just kind of continue
5278539 ive lost my benefits or i cant get them because my kids got a chronic heart problem or something
5278540 hey if you havent signed up as a precinct or block captain please do so the coordinators theyre ready for you give them your telephone and e mail address and so on and so forth well be in touch with you
5278541 well in the final maybe you did that in the primary dukakis but in the final its all its all this kind of stuff
5278542 get it off the air and i really mean it
5278543 i know what im walking into here i know there are some people who are going to try to take advantage of this but were going to take them on
5278544 well who is this guy anyway youre changing youre moving from here to there everywhere
5278545 hey those attacks that are coming from mccain heres the truth
5278546 look give me a summary of the kinds of things we want to say
5278547 i am married to the next president of the united states
5278548 run for governor ok what do i have to do
5278549 a key statistical procedure on which many past epidemiological studies had relied was flawed
5278550 emissions of smog producing pollutants decreased both nationally and regionally between 1990 and 2000
5278551 both decreased substantially nationally and regionally with statistically significant downward trends nationally no levels in 2005 were about 50 lower than in 1991 and no2 about 30 lower
5278552 one million to die from smog related illnesses in the next two years
5278553 the most problematic aspect of the cmas research is the assumption that air pollution kills
5278554 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
5278555 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
5278556 more progress in sales combined with strong sales growth marked the first half of 2008 for net entertainment a total of eight new license agreements for casinomodule were signed with among others bet at home com an influential european online operator our efforts to address new market segments and tier 1 operators have proven highly productive largely due to our strong competitive product portfolio
5278557 in the next few years europe is expected to represent more than 50 percent of total gaming revenues and grow by 15 20 percent annually making it by far the largest gaming market
5278558 net entertainment views the conditions for continued expansion in the casino market as good
5278559 the market for online gaming is maturing resulting in consolidations and increased competition between operators
5278560 online operators continue to add new products making them more and more like gaming portals
5278561 this helps attract new players while simultaneously boosting revenues from existing customers through cross sales all in all this development benefits net entertainment and the company means to take an active role in the market restructuring
5278562 market surveys show for example an increasing percentage of women partly driven by the growth of such new gaming segments as bingo and skill games the traditional image of a typical player a man aged between 25 and 35 is thus much less predominant than before
5278563 at the same time we are observing how gaming activities are becoming increasingly popular among older age groups
5278564 i was coming down just like normal and everything was fine
5278565 i actually felt really good about the shot as it was coming in and i was getting on the trigger the gun just went off
5278566 my first thought was like oh thats not good i hope thats in the black i looked down and it was in the black but it was a very bad shot
5278567 you shoot the shots that you never shoot just like the last olympics
5278568 its something thats ridiculous it never happens and it happens it just wasnt meant to be
5278569 dude ive got an olympic silver medal olympic gold medal and i should have two more gold medals there is nothing wrong with my mind
5278570 wanita yang terbaik diantara kamu adalah yang membuang perisai malu ketika ia membuka baju untuk suaminya dan memasang perisai malu ketika ia berpaka
5278571 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5278572 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5278573 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5278574 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5278575 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5278576 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5278577 every four years you usually get to look at these guys try to go native think of president bush in his brush clearing outfit
5278578 but if youre president the day job does involve a suit and it can be awkward when youre not in work clothes
5278579 everyone knows how fast a picture can go from local novelty to worldwide laughingstock
5278580 it shows hes not trying to be like everyone else its part of the visual message that hes crafting in an odd little way it adds to the not pandering in a conservative middle america suit like a 50 year old tax lawyer wears
5278581 it would be inappropriate if mccain looked as stylish as obama he has a different physique hes a different age and hes much more conservative
5278582 he does have occasional fun with a wider flashy tie
5278583 not all senators can wear that but it looks right on him
5278584 you could put baracks head on johns body and say hes gained a little weight but you wouldnt notice he was in different clothes
5278585 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
5278586 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
5278587 im thrilled and i had it record in the back of my mind
5278588 it was a great day i was running with some fast people i felt good and i tried to keep the pace up
5278589 the last mile race director ivan gallant told me i had about seven minutes to break the course record
5278590 its a great course fun and challenging and it feels good to be finished but theres something that obviously draws you back
5278591 but you know in your head once you get through those that its going to be ok just a little rolling after that
5278592 to push up them knowing you still have a long way ahead
5278593 you want to try to maintain a hard but comfortable pace
5278594 i definitely wouldnt be able to do it without them
5278595 ellen degeneres and portia de rossi were married tonight in an intimate ceremony at their home in los angeles
5278596 ive always felt uncomfortable about the articles that eulogized me as a nurse chauffeur cook housekeeper financier counselor philosopher mistress teacher and hostess it seemed i always read an article like this on the day when my kid was in a school play and i ironed only the leg of the trouser that faced the audience knitted all morning napped all afternoon bought pizza for dinner and had a headache by 10 30 for a long time i was afraid to laugh at the contrast for fear no one else would
5278597 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us it is not just in some of us it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others
5278598 trust yourself create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement
5278599 the real contest is always between what youve done and what youre capable of doing you measure yourself against yourself and nobody else

5278615 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
5278616 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
5278617 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
5278618 since man lives by the permission of physical geography it is his fate to be divided by mountains rivers and seas into groups that develop in semi isolation their diverging languages and creeds their climatically conditioned features customs and dress
5278619 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
5278620 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5278621 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5278622 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5278623 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5278624 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5278625 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5278626 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5278627 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5278628 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
5278629 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
5278630 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
5278631 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
5278632 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
5278633 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
5278634 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
5278635 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
5278636 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
5278637 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
5278638 the time has come to put our system of legal and administrative tax assistance on a new path
5278639 lancet has since disowned the paper but not before fears of the mmr vaccine became widespread and led to many parents choosing not to vaccinate their children and a serious increase in measles in the uk
5278640 i think thats true if we had not had any urgency to get on with it we would not be in the muddle we are in now because we would have done it in the usual way by getting a referral dr wakefield was a man in a hurry and in full time research
5278641 theres a pressure to get there before someone else does dr wakefield had a strong conviction that his hypothesis was correct he believed it and thats what led to the pressure
5278642 god called me to dedicate my life to young people to go among them and find them because today it is hard for young people to go to church so it has to be the church to go towards them this project was born to attract young people in the places where they normally hang out such as streets and beaches
5278643 karena sepertinya kalian begitu penasaran akan aku jelaskan secara singkat
5278644 bukankah mereka berada terlalu jauh bahkan dengan warp butuh waktu berbulan bulan untuk sampai
5278645 ini bisa dibilang kalau kami melakukan warp pada gelombang komunikasi
5278646 dalam medan warp hanya gelombang jarak pendek yang bekerja itupun dengan menggunakan beberapa repeater
5278647 bagaimana bisa hal itu terjadi itu belum pernah diujicobakan dan kemungkinan berhasilnya mendekati 0
5278648 sebenarnya apa yang terjadi menurut teori semua ini tidak mungkin
5278649 tidak mungkin gelombang komunikasi dikirimkan melalui warp memang benar kalau gelombang mekanik seperti yang digunakan di bumi saat perang dunia iii bisa bertahan dalam medan warp tapi gelombang itu sendiri tidak akan sampai dalam keadaan utuh lagipula gelombang mekanik memerlukan medium untuk merambat
5278650 wow aku tidak tahu kalau kau sangat ahli dalam mekanika gelombang kolonel
5278651 apa yang dikatakan kolonel eko memang benar tapi sepertinya kolonel eko salah paham
5278652 aku tidak pernah mengirim gelombang mekanik melalui medan warp karena memang itu mustahil
5278653 sudahlah kalau dijelaskan akan makan waktu lama aku punya data hasil penelitianku pada fluks kamu boleh mengambilnya sebagai referensi
5278654 kecelakaan itu awalnya memang salahku kan kau tidak perlu khawatir k2
5278655 dia sedang mengendalikan repeater agar kita bisa berbicara tanpa gangguan
5278656 ya aku sudah menduganya kau ingin keluar dari ketentaraan bukan
5278657 aku benar benar tidak mengerti caramu berpikir dulu kamu melepaskan jabatanmu sebagai admiral dan turun pangkat menjadi kolonel untuk bisa bersama aura sekarang kenapa lagi
5278658 our latest research shows that train to gain is helping to unlock staff potential through recommending and delivering relevant job specific training i urge more organisations to follow suit and get involved and see the benefits of investing in training for the long term

5278685 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
5278686 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
5278687 we love the american people its the policies of your government we dont like
5278688 the prophets endure and can only be ignored at the risk of our own despair
5278689 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
5278690 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
5278691 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
5278692 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
5278693 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
5278694 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5278695 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5278696 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5278697 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5278698 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5278699 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5278700 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5278701 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5278702 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5278703 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5278704 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5278705 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5278706 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5278707 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5278708 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5278709 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5278710 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5278711 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5278712 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5278713 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5278714 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5278715 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5278716 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5278717 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5278718 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5278719 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5278720 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5278721 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5278722 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5278723 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5278724 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5278725 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5278726 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5278727 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5278728 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5278729 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5278730 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5278731 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5278732 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5278733 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5278734 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5278735 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5278736 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5278737 were going to stay in iraq to get the job done as long as the government wants us there
5278738 said his government was impatiently waiting for the complete withdrawal of u
5278739 redeploy combat brigades from iraq at a pace of 1 to 2 brigades a month that would remove them in 16 months
5278740 opposes the present us policy in iraq not on the basis of any principled opposition to neo colonialism or aggressive war but rather on the grounds that the iraq war is a mistaken deployment of power that fails to advance the global strategic interests of american imperialism
5278741 theres not that much difference between my position and george bushs position at this stage
5278742 nazis soviets in their gulags or some mad regime pol pot or others that had no concern for human beings
5278743 he would return the country to the more traditional foreign policy efforts of past presidents such as george h
5278744 these days an appreciable number of obama supporters are starting to use words like disillusionment but thats a consequence of projecting their political outlooks onto the candidate in the first place the best way to avoid becoming disillusioned is to not have illusions in the first place
5278745 the international tribunal for the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former yugoslavia since 1991
5278746 wilful killing wilfully causing great suffering and serious injury to body and health employment of poisonous weapons and other weapons to cause unnecessary suffering wanton destruction of cities towns and villages unlawful attacks on civilian objects devastation not necessitated by military objectives attacks on undefended buildings and dwellings destruction and wilful damage done to institutions dedicated to religion charity and education the arts and sciences
5278747 not only a requirement of law it is a requirement of justice to the victims and of deterrence to powerful countries such as those in nato who in their military might and in their control over the media are lacking in any other natural restraint such as might deter less powerful countries
5278748 by holding individuals accountable regardless of their position the ictys work has dismantled the tradition of impunity for war crimes and other serious violations of international law particularly by individuals who held the most senior positions
5278749 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
5278750 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
5278751 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
5278752 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
5278753 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
5278754 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
5278755 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
5278756 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
5278757 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
5278758 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
5278759 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
5278760 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
5278761 we need good age and identity verification technology so that its much harder for an individual to get online and pretend to be 15 when really its a 45 year old man
5278762 why dont i do a mystery about the character alarma
5278763 hahaha this was all a dream none of this exists
5278764 das ist eine frage der erziehung wenn man eingeladen wird ist es h flich guten tag zu sagen
5278765 diese abgaben h ngen von politischen machthabern ab und sind damit nicht garantiert
5278766 the military has been central to this major shift in pakistan
5278767 this military is telling president pervez musharraf please step down and avoid further humiliation for yourself and also for the army
5278768 the military has probably concluded that president musharraf staying on as the president will only cause more divisions in pakistan
5278769 in public we say the military must remain neutral but in private we all know the military is a powerful player and they have to be on board
5278770 it is a victory of democratic forces today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5278771 to understand the kinds of analyses applied by different disciplines to questions about community to apply methodologies of different disciplines to contemporary questions about media technology sociality and society in a variety of settings and to establish both theoretical and experiential foundations for making personal decisions and judgments regarding the relationship between mediated communication and human community
5278772 sampling in music is when you take a piece of pre recorded music and you then use it as an element to make a new piece of music
5278773 a big dilemma with this electronic music culture is that when you are sampling music that you dont own the rights to because someone else is the copyright holder of that music then you are putting yourself in danger of being sued
5278774 live nation benefits from the difficulty of replicating the live experience that casual and passionate fans pay for in good times or bad
5278775 started with control of the venues then used that to spread out into other areas of the music industry and by so doing its competing with the record labels
5278776 if live nation can get to the point where its paying on parity to what the labels are paying or even below that then it will be a great strategy
5278777 madonna is not getting paid 120 million upfront the money is getting paid out over ten years and thats only if she performs
5278778 we dont want to destroy the nato russia council but russias actions have called into question the premise of the nato russia relationship
5278779 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
5278780 america uses a lot of oil thats 25 percent of the worlds oil demand used by just 4 percent of the world population
5278781 the simple truth is that cheap and easy oil is gone
5278782 i think i would be for al gore for energy czar in an obama administration
5278783 pickens is out to make billions of dollars for himself and to save the sierra clubs anti coal anti oil anti natural gas agenda
5278784 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5278785 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
5278786 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5278787 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
5278788 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
5278789 i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
5278790 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
5278791 what do we have to give up to reach the cost of a trillion and a half to three trillion dollars theres going to have to be some pain some sacrifice on the part of the american taxpayer isnt there
5278792 the real way to bring gasoline prices down is not by going back to try more of the same things that have not worked in the past but to say wait a minute now is the time for a really dramatic shift over to renewable energy
5278793 he did not force gore to debate a crackpot from cloud cuckoo land who is still waiting for the evidence to arrive about human sources of radical climate change
5278794 the unsupported assumption catastrophic global warming follows burning fossil fuels requires immediate action
5278795 the unsupported assumption that the world is more than 6000 years old
5278796 he did not force gore to debate a crackpot from cloud cuckoo land who is still waiting for the evidence to arrive about human sources of radical climate change
5278797 the feeling is that we would get greater revenue for media if we had more regular season games
5278798 the bottom line is that i think youll see us going to 17 or 18 regular season games in the future
5278799 y oud have to balance that with the need that coaches have to develop and get a team ready to play could it be two preseason games or three i personally wouldnt be adverse to either one
5278800 gin clear specifics propped by ample research and an abiding sense of decency
5278801 now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
5278802 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be part of georgias future but these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
5278803 whether i win or lose the impeachment the nation will lose
5278804 they dont realize they can succeed against me but the country will undergo irreparable damage
5278805 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
5278806 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
5278807 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
5278808 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
5278809 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5278810 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
5278811 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5278812 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5278813 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5278814 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5278815 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
5278816 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
5278817 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
5278818 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
5278819 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
5278820 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
5278821 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
5278822 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
5278823 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
5278824 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
5278825 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
5278826 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5278827 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5278828 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
5278829 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
5278830 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5278831 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5278832 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5278833 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5278834 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5278835 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5278836 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5278837 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5278838 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5278839 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5278840 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
5278841 okay this is makati avenue where did they say the library was
5278842 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
5278843 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
5278844 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
5278845 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
5278846 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
5278847 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
5278848 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
5278849 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
5278850 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
5278851 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
5278852 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
5278853 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
5278854 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
5278855 call this number if you run into a curb and get a flat tire call this number if youre in an accident and well just be holding a 1000 pound surety on your account in case of any damages
5278856 have generally not found studies claiming adverse health effects from low doses of bisphenol a to be compelling
5278857 the data show bpa intakes are highest in infants and young children and neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects were observed in laboratory animals at very low levels of exposure and close to levels to which infants and young children are exposed
5278858 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
5278859 it will take away a symbol of hatred but the essential issues dont end with musharraf
5278860 its a virulent cancer that is eating into our society
5278861 the terrorists are not going to surrender they have long term objectives in the region
5278862 this is a positive change but it is just the beginning
5278863 if the government ends these policies the taliban will stop their activities immediately
5278864 he should also be awarded strict punishment because he is a culprit of the whole country
5278865 musharraf was a little more pragmatic than his predecessors if we look at his exit purely from viewpoint of its bearing on the kashmir issue its bad news for india
5278866 moreover we dont know how long will the unity between asif zardari co chairman of pakistan peoples party and nawaz sharif head of pakistan muslim league nawaz last it also remains to be seen how stable this coalition will be
5278867 in such a situation there is every chance that kashmir will become an issue in party politics with each side trying to outdo the other by more hawkish postures on kashmir
5278868 musharraf was a little more reasonable on kashmir but his formulations were something india could not accept
5278869 the peace process is also likely to slow down due to domestic political preoccupations in pakistan
5278870 we dont really know who is in control and whether they can rein in forces inimical to indian interests
5278871 the memorandum seeks a un intervention for the permanent resolution of kashmir issue in the wake of the economic blockade imposed on the valley
5278872 knowing this first of all that no prophecy of scripture comes from someones own interpretation for no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man but men spoke from gos as they were carried along by the holy spirit
5278873 lord i know you are high and lofty and i am not humble me so that i can see where you want me to change my thoughts attitudes beliefs and actions so that they are in line with your word
5278874 for if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror for he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he looks like
5278875 tim wore his catholicism proudly he talked about it all the time
5278876 in fact russerts faith was not an elephant in the room it was the room it was the room he was raised in it was one of his great charms as was how he dealt with it in life and in our public discourse
5278877 catholicism was his base it was never his bias i think thats absolutely crucial and i will debate anyone who contends to the contrary
5278878 learnings from the political process for common ground in the catholic church
5278879 understood that the stakes were high he knew that better than most of us
5278880 he knew that the civility of our dialogue was under attack he knew that diversity in the public square takes work every day and he knew that our standards of journalism were being attacked
5278881 he understood what it meant to be called to be catholic and i think thats very important he took the call
5278882 see such a simple man as a boatman recognize the lord despite his ascetic attire
5278883 tears are coming down their cheeks while they ad him the passeur does he need anyone to cross the river
5278884 voyez un homme aussi simple quun batelier reconna t le seigneur malgr son habit dasc tique voyez la grandeur de ram il laisse le batelier poser ses conditions pour le prendre dans son bateau
5278885 childhood hunger is a significant issue in our country and joes crab shack is committed to reducing the number of children that are forced to fight hunger every day
5278886 it means a lot to us to provide not only financial support but as we do with all our restaurants we wanted to create a memorable experience when customers come in to dine which is why we developed the t shirts
5278887 one in every six children in america suffers from uncertain access to the healthy nutritious foods they need to avoid the lifelong and devastating consequences of hunger
5278888 we are in striking distance of ending childhood hunger and by in by institutionalizing what we know has worked joining forces together we can make this vision a reality
5278889 the morning meal drives the foodservice industry in china and it has an effect on all aspects of the foodservice market
5278890 the top food and drink items are driven by what chinese consumers buy for their morning meal and what can easily be produced and distributed by foodservice operators
5278891 soren withdrew his support from the government after chief minister madhu koda refused to obey his directive to step down so he should also pull out of the upa government which is yet to fulfil jmms 13 point charter of demands including his soren re induction into the union cabinet in lieu of its support in the july 22 trust vote
5278892 the centre did not bother to pay heed to jmms demands but the party did not have the courage to pull out
5278893 weve done worse things than take a piss on a bus
5278894 we were basically stuck up the canyon without our rafts
5278895 we had no supplies no food and very little water we lost everything
5278896 were not as concerned about it as we initially were
5278897 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5278898 but its a good opportunity to practice like it was the big one
5278899 as long as the grotto stands key west will never again experience the full brunt of a hurricane
5278900 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5278901 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5278902 i pray the government stops this down sliding and take the country out of this crisis
5278903 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership
5278904 sie treffen hier das was ihren erwartungen an luxus und eleganz entspricht
5278905 es gibt keine offene prostitution keinen drogenhandel und keinen vandalismus
5278906 sie gehen gerne in schl sser wo viel gold ist
5278907 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5278908 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5278909 i wouldnt say theres a humanitarian catastrophe but theres an urgent need for primary products
5278910 did you know richard nixon is the only president whose formal portrait was painted by a police sketch artist
5278911 not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
5278912 people werent creating and posting videos online there was jibjab a website but that was done by a production crew what youre seeing now are individuals participating in the process and thats really exciting
5278913 so often with these its not the huge production values that make them work
5278914 in a couple of hours we can turn something around its the ideas behind them not the money
5278915 what makes this such a fun election is that there is so much awareness its like when youre at the water cooler and everybody watched the same television show the night before people are just really ready to be engaged
5278916 then of course theres just so much to rip on
5278917 the guy who sits on the sidelines teaching the white guy valuable lessons like bagger vance the big magical brother from the green mile or when shaq played kazaam

5278928 obamas camp initially agreed that the cartoon was quote tasteless and offensive really you know what your response should have been its very easy here let me put the statement out for you barack obama is in no way upset about the cartoon that depicts him as a muslim extremist because you know who gets upset about cartoons muslim extremists
5278929 barack obama heading to hawaii for a vacation with his family
5278930 republicans say that john mccain will be good for business they didnt say what business but im guessing probably the scooter store doans pills craftmatic adjustable bed and the miracle ear
5278931 people are now talking about the ticket barack obama and hillary clinton would that be a good ticket and i think this would be the first if you think about it first combination of an african american man and a white woman since well michael jackson

5278936 he pointed but didn t show to the camera the alleged variations
5278937 all a man would have to do to write the worlds greatest novel is tell the truth it hasnt been done
5278938 the truth is what you can get someone else to believe
5278939 nothing is more damaging to a new truth than an old error
5278940 and the adrenalin flows and is reflected on the machine
5278941 if the testee is not insane or otherwise mentally deficient
5278942 the questions they asked were more mundane than my imaginings
5278943 are you holding back information about you that may subject you to blackmail
5278944 the system will not work as a carnival sideshow it should be used in real life for important matters

5278951 his speechifying has a strong odor of remedial reading about it combined with an apparent fear that there might be some hard words ahead
5278952 we are always everyone one of us at every moment on stage
5278953 the capering loon who does soft shoe in the white house while young americans are dismembered and splattered in iraq
5278954 my friends weve got beverages from hoffman and matzoh from streits for the unleavened experience of a lifetime streits my friends
5278955 carefully watch and listen to president bush and then dont do anything like that
5278956 maybe people will decide they dont want him when they realize he cant even read a speech any better than george bush
5278957 the capering loon with an apparent fear there might be some hard words ahead
5278958 does my heart good to see arthur godfrey recalled in the august pages of the nyt probably he and reagan were successful mainly because they started in radio where they learned to convey sincerity through voice alone
5278959 the secret of success is sincerity once you can fake that youve got it made
5278960 and just about everybody does it better than the capering loon who does soft shoe in the white house while young americans are dismembered and splattered in iraq sometimes when he speaks i can forget who he is momentarily and find myself actually pulling for him probably from misplaced performer empathy his speechifying has a strong odor of remedial reading about it combined with an apparent fear that there might be some hard words ahead
5278961 his speechifying has a strong odor of remedial reading about it combined with an apparent fear that there may be hard words ahead

5278965 thank god if there is one that there is only one dick cavett or we would be awash in brilliance
5278966 but dont you think they would worry about being considered just actors
5278967 and are you saying that when the candidates appear in public they are not acting
5278968 the next time youre in a serious accident call for a comedian thats precisely the time you need one and more than an ambulance
5278969 even better change would be to hear more use of the plural we instead of the constant i please note mark twains advice
5278970 there has been immense help from lakshmi narayan mittal to boost the morale of boxers at sai sports authority of india hostel in bhiwani in fact when akhil kumar injured his wrist mittal sent him abroad for surgery his help is a motivation for the budding boxers from the region
5278971 we believe that history will be created at beijing in the coming days and all of us are very optimistic and expecting a medal from jitender as he has really worked hard he has a sole aim of achieving big in boxing in his life and is devoted to it for the last eight years
5278972 his role model is akhil from whom he is learning for the last nine years he is so dedicated towards learning from akhil that you will find everything in jitender quite similar to his coach akhil his style of hitting defence and even his way of speaking resembles akhil
5278973 jitender was very sharp in his studies but after seeing his extraordinary talent and interest in boxing we decided to send him to sai hostel
5278974 everyone is busy in praying to goddess durga akhils father and mother have decided that they will not talk to anyone till akhils bout
5278975 we had talked to akhil yesterday sunday he is confident of putting up his best show now we will not call him before his match as it might divert his attention relatives and family friends have started pouring in and the whole locality is enthusiastic about todays match
5278976 akhil is an aggressive player and believes in attacking his opponent akhil is very dedicated to boxing he came to the sai hostel in bhiwani in 1998 and joined the railways in 2000 and has religiously attended all the camps organised by sai till date
5278977 we can name bhiwani as a sports city of india it has not only produced good boxers but has also produced many athletes and volleyball players of international stature every youngster here possesses a passion for sports

5278982 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5278983 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5278984 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5278985 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

5278987 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5278988 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5278989 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

5278997 polygraph testing has been the gold standard but its obviously fools gold
5278998 thanks for trying to make this old country lawyer a star
5278999 look i know youre lying im going to give you one chance to tell the truth

5279005 its the first time a man has dropped three tons of dynamite in two mintues
5279006 the way to deal with superstition is not to be polite to it but to tackle it with all arms and so rout it cripple it and make it forever infamous and ridiculous

5279014 our bowlers did well but we never had enough runs to defend
5279015 i would have liked to bowl first but now that its gone you cannot do anything about it
5279016 the negatives remain where they were oil prices have started rising at home you have inflation

5279027 sure go sit in the recliner and take a breather
5279028 i ask him carson how he feels about his talk show competitor dick cavett
5279029 parenthetically to the point of irrelevance one of bill clinton s lesser legacies to us all has been to make it just about impossible for anyone in public life and in the media to say anything without prefacing it with the now reflexive phrase let me say this who s stopping you
5279030 where would we be without social security we would have no social security
5279031 at the risk of sounding curmudgeonly attending anything that threatened a forced viewing of a lot of new and largely unknown standup comics would be low on my list of musts down there between dedicating a statue of spiro agnew and a street sale of macram
5279032 at the risk of sounding curmudgeonly you have to have the word
5279033 actually i was filling out a blank check for the alumni fund
5279034 all governments lie the life and times of rebel journalist i f stone
5279035 mr cavett these men and women have taken an oath on the bible to tell the truth and i therefore have to believe them
5279036 the likes of whom we will not likely ever see again
5279037 lets see if my name cuts any ice down here
5279038 hey i just met someone exactly like william f buckley
5279039 if i were composing a top 10 list of things that will never be said i submit as number one hey i just met someone exactly like william f buckley
5279040 to richard in deepest gratitude for more in seurat than in ingres may i use it with affection bill
5279041 would i be one of those who might appear in your novels
5279042 you have another minute and a half if you would like to elaborate on your answer
5279043 no ill just contemplate the great eloquence of my previous remarks
5279044 he would convince us that we are all too soft from being handed things too easily

5279049 the predictable and dreary sort of folk you get these days
5279050 vice is a monster of such frightful mien as to be hated needs but to be seen yet seen too oft familiar with her face we first endure and then embrace
5279051 mr buckley i read your piece on and wondered what you meant by could you elucidate
5279052 hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful
5279053 do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you
5279054 what is hateful to you do not do to your fellowman
5279055 timely true gentle purposeful and spoken with a mind of loving kindness
5279056 which of these less than correct answers do the test makers consider to be the right choice
5279057 i just watched the 1960s debate between buckley and noam chomsky on youtube and my modest opinion of wfb was reaffirmed he may have been eloquent witty and a good friend but he was also unable to deal with intellectual equals like chomsky thus interrupting constantly in that respect he was the forerunner of all the current right wing talk hosts he always seemed arrogant to me
5279058 all the worst pleasures are purely spiritual the pleasure of putting other people in the wrong of bossing and patronising and spoiling sport and backbiting the pleasures of power of hatred
5279059 how does one say antisemitic things yet not merit the appellation antisemite
5279060 totally out of line buckleys going to be really angry
5279061 buckley was a consistent opponent of the struggles of non wealthy minorities blacks latinos women gays you name it to claim for themselves the rights that he took for granted for himself
5279062 what does matter is that buckley was on the wrong side of every important issue facing post world war ii america and it matters a great deal that he spawned the movement that has resulted in the disasters that the current occupant of the white house has unleashed upon the country and the world
5279063 there are some things up with which i will not put
5279064 never worked a day in his life out of necessity

5279070 i said do you mean youre going to let your teeth rot out

5279072 if i can make 7 balls on one shot can i have the job
5279073 you might want to drop by the law school tonight a man i consider one of the most dangerous men in america is lecturing there
5279074 buckleys amazing isnt he if he had a little more of the common touch hed be a truly dangerous man

5279084 there was the moment during the 68 presidential campaign when norman mailer and william buckley were providing their understanding of what was happening in chicago at the convention i believe that mr mailer wound up calling mr buckley a crypto nazi during their short on air debate
5279085 dont you dare call one who was infantry the last war a crypto nazi or ill paste you in your goddamn face and youll stay pasted
5279086 one cant doubt that the american objective in iraq has failed different plans have to be made

5279097 hysterical manner which obviously negated her argument my response was william buckley he speaks in meaured tones in an erudite manner his reasoning sounds logical but always leads to invalid conclusions
5279098 if only he had used his powers for good instead of eeeevil
5279099 well i cant express myself as well as you mr buckley so you win on that point

5279270 i ve decided that the single worst thing about this illness is its terrible authority
5279271 i am more alarmed by the ever cheerful ones in our midst past who skip over all the unpleasant debris of human nature i e the human will ability to be evil unfair and so on don t they strike you as slightly insane isn t it more realistic to think we have this mournful streak in our nature for a reason
5279272 as i add more decades of experience to my resume it seems to me more and more that left leaning intellectuals consider it wonderfully witty to assume that 40 60 percent of the population is beneath their contempt

5279281 the road from suicide to life is cold and colder and colder still but with steely effort the grace of god and an inevitable break in the weather it is possible to make the journey
5279282 death was now a daily presence blowing over me in cold gusts i had not conceived precisely how my end would come in short i was still keeping the idea of suicide at bay but plainly the possibility was around the corner and i would soon meet it face to face what i had begun to discover is that mysteriously and in ways that are totally remote from normal experience the grey drizzle of horror induced by depression takes on the quality of physical pain but it is not an immediately identifiable pain like that of a broken limb it may be more accurate to say that despair owing to some evil trick played upon the sick brain by the inhabiting psyche comes to resemble the diabolical discomfort of being imprisoned in a fiercely overheated room and because no breeze stirs this caldron because there is no escape from this smothering confinement it is entirely natural that the victim begins to think ceaselessly of oblivion
5279283 as common as when you couldnt go on but did

5279295 i have to end this misery i am going down to the station and jump in front of the next train that pulls in
5279296 ooh the big wheels and the crunching and the blood what a horrible way to die

5279326 oh this is how other people feel all the time life is wonderful
5279327 the art of being sick is not the same as the art of getting well but the ordeal of facing your mortality and feeling your fraility sharpens your perspective about life
5279328 and you realize you have received a great gift a field of vision others dont have about the power of hope and the limits of fear a firm set of convictions about what really matters and what does not things are worse than illness for instance soulnessness

5279569 why is it that anderson has not expelled the many pro abortion and pro homosexual politicians and members in the k of c and why do councils continue to rent their halls to them actions speak louder than words the danger to unborn children demands action not empty rhetoric
5279570 its time we stop accommodating pro abortion politicians and its time we start demanding that they accommodate us
5279571 anderson was half right while the weakest go to the wall with 50 million babies aborted since roe v wade in 1973 the k of c have not really completely evolved into an action group to eliminate abortion anderson refuses to recognize that he and the order are a massive part of the abortion problem and that k of c politicians defeated an effort by a record 170 000 signatories to put traditional marriage on the ballot in massachusetts in 2008 not only that but out of state homosexuals can now marry in massachusetts and return to their home states to seek legal recognition because k of c politicians just recently helped repeal a massachusetts protect marriage law
5279572 anderson has led the k of c for nearly eight years he has happily followed in the footsteps of former supreme knight virgil dechant who told me in august 2005 that pro abortion politicians will never be expelled anderson dechant and supreme advocate paul devin who ruled unconstitutional a massachusetts state convention resolution by grand knight joe craven to suspend pro abortion and pro homosexual politicians must go to be taken seriously supreme chaplain bishop william lori and the other bishops must excommunicate the pro abortion and pro homosexual politicians and members

5279607 siapa yang membantahmu tentang dia al masih setelah datang kepadamu ilmu maka katakanlah kepada mereka marilah kami memanggil anak anak lelaki kami dan kamu memanggil anak anak lelaki kamu perempuan perempuan kami dan perempuan perempuan kamu dan diri diri kami serta diri diri kamu kita bermubahalah dan kita tetapkan laknat allah atas mereka yang berdusta
5279608 sesungguhnya ketika mereka nasrani diseru untuk bermubahalah mereka mengatakan nanti akan kami pertimbangkan terlebih dahulu tatkala mereka berpaling dari mubahalah berkatalah mereka kepada al aqib yang menjadi juru bicara mereka wahai hamba al masih bagaimanakah menurutmu dia berkata demi allah kalian juga tentu mengetahui wahai umat nasrani bahwa muhammad adalah seorang nabi dan rasul dia datang kepadamu membawa penjelasan mengenai isa jesus demi allah tidak ada satu kaum pun yang mengadakan mubahalah dengan seorang nabi lalu mereka hidup dan jika kalian melakukan mubahalah dengannya nescaya kalian semua pasti binasa dan apabila kalian ingin tetap berpegang kepada ajaran kalian maka tinggalkan orang tersebut dan pulanglah ke kampung halaman kalian
5279609 wahai umat nasrani sungguh aku melihat wajah wajah yang sendainya mereka berdoa kepada allah agar dia allah menghilangkan sebuah gunung dari tempatnya pasti doa mereka akan dikabulkan oleh kerana itu tinggalkan mubahalah sebab kalian akan celaka yang nantinya tidak akan tersisa seorang nasrani pun sampai hari kiamat
5279610 wahai abul qasim kami telah mengambil keputusan bahawa kami tidak jadi bermubahalah namun kami ingin tetap memeluk agama kami
5279611 jika kalian enggan mubahalah maka terimalah islam bagi kalian dan akan berlaku hukum atas kalian sebagai mana berlaku atas mereka muslimin yang lain

5279670 people want to know how people make decisions whether its how you drive your car or whether to invest in a mortgage its important to understand when and how we make those decisions to understand the type of errors people are prone to make
5279671 what we have found is that people make decisions based on what option appears to be better most of the time under conditions in the natural world this would be the best strategy but in modern life it has nothing do with the real inherent risks

5279674 er i have been ere for a beet less than a year now
5279675 with my ma zere we have a house in ze suburbs
5279676 oh well im not sure how long im in melbourne for so i just have a cheap place out west i actually just got here today so i havent really stayed the night there yet
5279677 all around actually ive been travelling for the past four years
5279678 nah only around asia and here unfortunately id love to go one day though
5279679 eef you are ever in france please be giving me a call no
5279680 yeah it was given to me by my grandfather actually
5279681 he was a crazy man that one i loved him when i was younger hed tell stories about going all around the world and sleeping with oh so many women he didnt have an awful lot of children sense strange to say given he had so many grandchildren
5279682 and so i did what my grandfather and so many others in my old family had done i went forward and forward and never stopped and if i was to come back to where i had already been it was only after circling the globe
5279683 if you need a place to stay while youre here just ask
5279684 thanks i think ill spend a few nights on my own just to settle into the place ive rented you know but yeah in future i might take you up on that offer
5279685 listen gordon that was so long ago its really all right
5279686 well back then you know i wanted to say it then but youd already left we had a nice thing going even though it was brief
5279687 i just feel sometimes like ive missed out on so much you know living in that tiny town in the middle of nowhere
5279688 even now that im going places i feel like such a country bumpkin people dont take me seriously i reckon i just want stories to tell and to be somebody you know interesting somebody worth talking to
5279689 and no matter what their stories are like or whats in them its not going to make you interesting you can find people who have travelled the world and will bore you to death with their stories
5279690 and people run out of stories theyre not forever things theyre more like party tricks
5279691 but its fun to be paid attention to at you know parties and stuff
5279692 my familys asleep so well just pop in and grab some snacks
5279693 my home is everywhere anywhere i put my bags down i have a place out west that is my home for god knows how long and i hold so little allegiance to any of these places that tonight i might as well call this place my home
5279694 people talk a lot about settling down you know i used to say to them what my grandfather used to say that you can settle down a new place each night and be happy but of course hes a grandfather for a reason and its because he managed to stay put long enough to you know plant his seed
5279695 and i dunno i reckon ive been settling down myself a bit i keep coming home sure i keep leaving but i keep coming home again
5279696 i guess i realise now that sure theres a lotta life out there to be found but maybe theres no more life out there than there is life in here
5279697 its been a long while since someone has come to pay their respects
5279698 benny had a lot of different people who loved him very much and who id never met but one by one they came after his death like you they were mostly from out of town
5279699 oh you dont know it was a car accident so sudden and needless they said the driver was reckless he was just crossing the road
5279700 no honestly i dont mind you being here please tell me how you knew benny
5279701 oh yes loved by so many i just wished he couldve loved everyone back just the same he left everyone who loved him sticking with nobody in the end really
5279702 sometimes sometimes but the thing that really hurt was how distant he was when he died i dont mean actually distant you know he was only on the other side of town but he was so distant from this home so distant from me at that time
5279703 in fact they couldnt even trace him back to a house when they found him i found out from the news the most awful way to find it out
5279704 i am from athens she is from istanbul we met last week in adelaide

5279752 its hard to tell if i will be at birmingham when the transfer window closes but at the minute im there unless im told otherwise
5279753 to be perfectly honest i wouldnt entertain a move to glasgow
5279754 im happy to be playing outside scotland at the minute especially with the kind of press thats been going about for rangers and celtic im quite happy to be away from it
5279755 i read the papers and i watch the television and there has been some bad press for rangers recently im afraid thats what you get at the two biggest teams there is always stories to be written whether they are good or bad
5279756 my place is not going to be given to me i still need to work hard for it
5279757 i watched the last two games and we played well at times so im looking forward to it and i will be doing my best to get the lads to a major finals
5279758 you look at the results in the last qualification campaign but that doesnt mean we can be complacent and expect to beat teams
5279759 its great that people are being inspired by the games and the performances taking place across different sports but each individual needs to know their limits to avoid injuring yourself by overstretching setting smaller targets for performance improvements in your fitness regime would be the best start in improving your exercise rates whether thats on the rowing machine bike or on the treadmill
5279760 hey i know you all i gotta picture of you all right here on my fridge heres my yankee great great
5279761 yes grandma im sure her daddy was an asian man
5279762 i just dont wart her unlovely nickname for me since i was a very skinny sickly looking baby atall i just dont see a lick of wart in that girl
5279763 grandma shes adopted they went to vietnam last year to bring her home
5279764 these are combining to create a kind of a perfect storm that we have going on right now
5279765 you see it in rising food prices rising energy prices and a great land grab to produce biofuels the easiest way to grow these crops is to grab lands in the tropics from rainforests
5279766 meanwhile the developing world sees climate change as a train crashing through their countries but something that is not their fault
5279767 forests fall because they are worth more cut down than standing this is a classic example of a market failure
5279768 philanthropy and taxes by governments arent going to be enough to fund forest conservation efforts on the kind of scale thats going to be needed to have a real impact
5279769 but for a market 10 15 billion is quite manageable thats about what we drink in wine and champagne every year in britain for a fraction of the percent of the three trillion dollar a year insurance business we could save forests
5279770 the central issue in this whole debate is how we put a true value on standing rainforest to the world community
5279771 the indigenous communities probably have the best track record of any group in looking after their forests and preventing deforestation
5279772 the problem that we face is that under the redd mechanism being developed by the un there is a danger that these groups wont see compensation because they have a low deforestation baseline and are therefore not emitting
5279773 we need to think about how these communities who have succeeded in protecting their forests should get paid as i see it a method for this is the ecosystem services they are providing the world
5279774 the world is waking up to this and will drive capital to the canopy
5279775 how much money would you be prepared to pay governor braga of amazonas to keep the rain coming
5279776 a primary driver of deforestation is agribusiness in the amazon
5279777 why did this investment happen the very first in the world in iwokrama
5279778 okay so you are going to pay people for ecosystem services now that is just paying people to do nothing so youre going to pay them not to cut down their trees what are they going to do sleep in hammocks and drink beer
5279779 we dont need too much we are happy for our capital to be employed and will take a small return
5279780 well that means all the money will go to aaa
5279781 the market is not perfect there is going to be good guys and bad guys
5279782 im not buying bad palm oil any more im only going to take good palm oil

5279891 we are elated to have salem as a new customer salem was quick to recognize the value of our then relatively new feature for riaa compliance in fact since salem cut over to streamaudio they have implemented many of our other premium software features along with a robust software system salem demands an error free high quality streaming service with an installed base of more than 50 media companies over 600 radio stations and commercial delivery of roughly 100 000 simultaneous streams to our customers listeners all day every day streamaudio has the capacity and experience to perform well for large groups
5279892 we had been considering streamaudio as our streaming vendor for some time mainly because of their feature rich software we started the migration of our streaming activities to streamaudio in early 2008 and the transition has gone very well at this time we have ninety radio stations streaming with streamaudio streamaudios streaming service and customer service has been excellent their streaming infrastructure and software is indeed one of the best in the industry and when we needed a feature that they did not have at the time they were quick to develop it for us also streamaudios compliance with the riaas royalty data collection requirements makes their solution very compelling
5279893 we are very pleased and proud to have salem communications as a customer
5279894 we started with a tall order from salem basically to cut over ninety radio stations in a very short period of time due to new requirements by the riaa it turns out that our task was much easier than expected because salem had a well defined conversion plan and their management sales staff and technical staff all took advantage of the training that we offer to all of our clients since we began salem has contributed several ideas that have lead to new features in our software repertoire we look forward to a long healthy relationship with salem
