7780000 we have excellent students and teachers and administrators who are focused and work very hard to teach that information it reflects what the ohio content standards are and thats what we teach
7780001 with a very large number of students with special needs the value added growth will give us the opportunity to meet ayp that we were not allowed to do
7780002 good teachers supportive parents and excellent students put all those variables together and you have excellence in testing
7780003 were continually working to improve the academic achievement of our students
7780004 wed like to increase the number of indicators from the 17 this year especially looking at the high school graduation tests for science and social studies but were very happy that all of our schools have been rated effective or excellent
7780005 there was some concern because we had certain students that hadnt been successful in the past
7780006 we will use professional development and see what we can do to help the students
7780007 our math scores improved over the past two years although theyre not where they should be
7780008 i talked with dave redd the former superintendent and he was disappointed there was a drop in scores
7780009 the new measure takes into consideration the progress thats been made
7780010 every time we contemplate a new program we always ask ourselves
7780011 in a district the size of ours every student makes a difference
7780012 everything is out on the road transportation is going well for us
7780013 we care for them we provide good service i feel bad for them especially when you get scabs and inexperienced people driving them
7780014 were continuing to say were open to talks we hope to hear something from the union or the mediator at any time parta is ready to talk
7780015 the numbers speak for themselves its not because of fair share theyre leaving
7780016 we think fair share is not a parta matter its a union matter people need to decide for themselves
7780017 four bsf jawans were injured in firing by pakistan forces along loc in sabzian area of poonch district where its post came under firing from across the border this morning
7780018 set out each day believing in your dreams know without a doubt that you were made for amazing things
7780019 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7780020 the fact is we had a very hard fought primary
7780021 there are going to be some of sen clintons supporters we have to work hard to persuade to come on board thats not surprising
7780022 the clintons love this country they love the democratic party and they are going to be active participants in our campaign for the remaining 70 days
7780023 bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank the economy out of the doldrums
7780024 it wouldnt make sense for me to want to edit his remarks
7780025 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7780026 there was a real opportunity missed there to hear from somebody who really understood what it was like to fight for the powerless that was his life i want to speak to some of those same concerns he had
7780027 youve got to be economical with your words though and the longer youre in the senate the more long winded you get
7780028 people dont know his story weve got to show them his heart his story of overcoming obstacles
7780029 i think because hes so eloquent and graceful people dont know he had to struggle
7780030 senators from both parties will tell you that hes always been willing to listen to other points of view
7780031 thanks for taking my calls when you knew i was calling to ask for money
7780032 youll always be my hero because you were willing to take on santorum
7780033 im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
7780034 a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that america has a place for him too
7780035 i dont think you can duplicate that kind of moment
7780036 and when she was working and going to school at the same time there were a few patches there where she had to get food stamps to make sure that we had enough to eat
7780037 so i know what youve gone through and thats why im in politics politics didnt bring me to working people working people brought me to politics
7780038 what tom decided to do was a big mistake and will result in a lot of wrongdoers not being punished
7780039 john morganelli as a prosecutor should show more professionalism in commenting on an investigation that he knows nothing about other than what hes read in the newspaper
7780040 john morganelli has never conducted a public corruption investigation in his career so its not surprising that he wouldnt know how these investigations work
7780041 when you have conflicts of interests as tom corbett has in bonusgate they come back to haunt you down the road
7780042 and i believe in the end that is going to jeopardize the investigation
7780043 maybe the only way in american politics today to bring people together
7780044 theres some of that but probably theres more gratitude for the honor of speaking
7780045 lets be candid were not at the point our party could nominate someone who is pro life maybe even for v p
7780046 and i think theres excitement about sen caseys win in 06 when we took down rick santorum a great effort that included pro choice democrats
7780047 bobby casey has not made it quite as much of his political being the way his dad did
7780048 missed an opportunity to listen to a guy who understood how people struggle
7780049 were going to stay here for just a couple of minutes to state our disgust with this abomination the way the city and secret service are tearing the constitution of the united states to shreds and then we will leave
7780050 i refuse to be emotionally blackmailed to vote for a candidate
7780051 a tall blond producer was waving her arms trying to get more passion
7780052 it just always inspired me that a person at that level would make time for me
7780053 she talked the soccer mom talk but didnt look the soccer mom part
7780054 but do you think she looks like a soccer mom
7780055 nothing says it more than when she brought those girls out
7780056 as the presidential campaign turns increasingly personal and the new obama biden ticket strikes a decidedly more populist tone democrats believe a mccain romney ticket would provide a near perfect frame for their class conscious message
7780057 it will be a contest theyll say between the son of a single mother and son of a car salesman against the son of an admiral and son of a governor
7780058 and even those who are not passionately committed to one side or the other are trying to figure out why obama didnt just go through the motions of vetting clinton for the vice presidency tell her that she was high on the list and go through the entire process it wouldnt have been true and clinton probably would have known it wasnt true but what could she have done as it turned out since obama blew her off she can now claim that she was disrespected in all this
7780059 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right

7780068 this building addition is only 25 percent of what we hope to do in ravenna
7780069 it took two years to get authorization from our company weve worked very hard on this
7780070 we certainly appreciate the presence of saint gobain in ravenna and we will readily accept any new jobs
7780071 we appreciate your efforts and the confidence of saint gobain to expand in ravenna
7780072 i was banking on it because if the buses werent running i wasnt going to class
7780073 all our buses are up and running and were transporting people
7780074 i like to take the bus here but after my classes are over i walk back to my car
7780075 one putt could have dropped instead of lipped the cup one chip shot could have landed closer to the hole or an approach shot could have stuck on the green
7780076 during the summer i had been pretty much doing midwest tournaments against competition as good or better than me
7780077 being able to give them a good match or beat them is really a confidence booster that has helped my game
7780078 mariahs mental game has just completely gone up a notch
7780079 shes 100 percent more focused when she goes out there to compete
7780080 on saturday at the districts last year the competition i had faced left me really sore
7780081 i actually couldnt believe the level of competition i was facing and that increased intensity level left me feeling out of shape
7780082 i took a break from serious practice last winter and when i came back to play tournaments i realized i was out of tennis shape pretty quickly
7780083 those experiences taught me that i really cant take a tennis break if i want to be successful
7780084 practicing against people better than you is really the only way you can get better at tennis
7780085 i really love the sport and playing at the collegiate level is something i really want to do
7780086 julian edelman is playing the best football he has since he has been here particularly throwing the ball which is where we have got to get better if we are going to be a decent offense
7780087 he is the guy but i do want to play another quarterback and we are going to do it the third series of each half
7780088 there is no quarterback controversy we are doing this for a couple of reasons no 1 is that giorgio morgan and anthony magazu have competed really hard for that backup quarterback job and they will compete this week whichever one comes out ahead is going to play that third series of each half and we are going to do that all year long
7780089 it allows him to come out of a game to calm down and see the game from a different perspective where he stands next to me and i can say
7780090 we are happy that tyree is part of the university and part of the basketball program
7780091 like all of our players he is somebody we are going to help advance towards graduation and he is also someone we hope can help us compete for a championship
7780092 q to israel haminn quaintance joined his old kent state mens basketball teammates on the m a c center floor during open gym monday afternoon in a tune up for the start of his pro career
7780093 i think its going to be good the nba thing didnt work out for me but im looking forward to this
7780094 i dont know much about israel right now but im from florida and i made it through ohio
7780095 if i can do that i can make it there
7780096 give people a broader insight into who barack obama is and not just as a candidate but as a man a husband and a father

7780107 the agency programs will be designed to provide positive impact to the industry to help create an environment for industry to be successful
7780108 while we will be working with industry on regaining albertas competitive edge we will leave the specifics of marketing business planning the production of cattle and processing of meat with the industry where it belongs
7780109 the most popular resources are the live and archived web casts
7780110 when we have a live web cast people from about 100 sites log on but each recorded web cast receives more than 70 views every month
7780111 beyond people that advise producers county extension agents natural resources conservation service nrcs staff and consultants we are finding policy makers producers the general public and even other scientists are using the web site
7780112 it is the best science based information on manure compiled from around the country to a single site users are coming to it to answer specific questions for general education and for continuing education
7780113 in the right place at the right time it can be very lethal
7780114 our biggest challenge is to keep it out of an area where it can do the most damage
7780115 its mobile its concealable those two things make it very dangerous
7780116 we had some bad guys draw up in a truck behind the jss sadr city with rocket launching rails on the back of it
7780117 they launched acetylene like canisters from them and then took off
7780118 if we find a large amount of tubes threaded at one end wheels to position the tubes to position the rockets combined with a bongo truck or other large truck those are the characteristics of finding an iram
7780119 to find them all together is either a coincidence or people are building an iram
7780120 right now we assess the distance at 500 meters at first we estimated it at 300 meters but they have gotten better at it i suspect the enemy will improve upon them even more
7780121 i wouldnt be surprised if in a year or two more start popping up
7780122 it eases the parents financial burden and then with peer pressure and discipline and academic achievement studies are showing how much it helps
7780123 you can see who belongs where and who doesnt and for people worried about individual self expression students can do that with their sneakers

7780125 dbas are already overworked and stretched in a million directions so the last hassle they want to face is a manual performance management tool or one that cant unite multiple database platforms into one simple view
7780126 by providing administrators with enterprise wide alerts and database health information through a simple ui performance center makes performance monitoring less tedious and time consuming
7780127 managing the performance of our databases is a top priority that requires equal parts of art and science and ideally the least amount of time and labor possible
7780128 performance center has become a staple in our company because it gives us fingertip access to all of our database performance details and with customizable alerts and notifications set to our specific preferences we can resolve any problems before they result in disgruntled end users
7780129 performance center is a key component of our strategy in delivering products that detect diagnose and ultimately correct database performance issues
7780130 with this release and our other performance optimization tools offered in the databasegear and codegear product portfolios application developers and database professionals alike can quickly implement end to end application performance from clients into servers and all the way through to the database
7780131 this track really has taught me a lot in terms of being a researcher
7780132 we aim for you to be independent clinical investigators when you finish this training
7780133 the best mentees ive had were incredibly persistent in maintaining our relationship sometimes even annoyingly so but thats what you have to do
7780134 our first year with this program went about as well as we could have hoped
7780135 we are happy to welcome the second cohort and excited to see what kind of progress they make
7780136 it will be up to you as the mentee to make these relationships work and the best mentor mentee relationships are very formal
7780137 this means you regularly set aside time to discuss the status of your research with your mentor
7780138 the best mentees ive had were incredibly persistent in maintaining our relationship sometimes even annoyingly so
7780139 quand je mexamine je minqui te quand je me compare je me rassure
7780140 this is a world war ii battleship with high fixed costs for maintenance and theres the cost of running the museum and utilities 720 000 a year its an expensive place to run
7780141 for the 3 million the state was getting back 9 2 million in economic impact
7780142 if the state wants to see vibrant cultural and historical museums in the state theres a level of support thats needed
7780143 each of these sites and activities are equally important to fueling the states economy
7780144 the liberty science center in jersey city was cut by 2 7 million and the newark museum lost 2 2 million
7780145 the goal of the budget was to take steps to fix state finances so we could match recurring spending with recurring revenues reduce state debt and ease the structural budget shortfall
7780146 the focus was to preserve core programs that service our seniors and other vulnerable populations
7780147 we are dependent on the states help so this is a big blow to us
7780148 its been a rough month we will have to do a better job of bringing in more money well have to work harder
7780149 we will have to handle tasks in much different ways assess operational priorities we will probably have some limited hours during the winter we will still have groups and encampments for a day
7780150 we are not a philadelphia based museum with main line support from wealthy contributors
7780151 i thought then and i still do what a heroic act
7780152 my feeling in 1976 is the same as it is today that two individuals were wrong in desecrating a symbol of the rights and freedoms that we have
7780153 our parking lots are full even on nice sunny days were very proud of that
7780154 this park and zoo not only does its part in preserving open space and wetlands in an area where that is shrinking its also always been a place where families can come and enjoy an entire day together without spending very much
7780155 i dont think that even covers the enjoyment we get out of coming here
7780156 you may hear more about zoos like the san diego zoo or the bronx but its really in many small and medium sized zoos like cape may countys where important works like the bongo repatriation project are going on
7780157 its within these smaller facilities that the expertise and the care for these kinds of projects resides
7780158 i brought my kids here when they were little and now theyre 34 and i bring my grandchildren here i cant believe what they started with and now what they have here now you could spend all day
7780159 we want the volunteers to help us put a face on what we are trying to accomplish at the gala
7780160 we want people to see that this gala supports research that helps real people
7780161 we want the volunteers to help us put a face on what we are trying to accomplish at the gala we want people to see that this gala supports research that helps real people
7780162 i think its no secret and i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think that settlement activity is helpful
7780163 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7780164 the peace process is not and should not be affected by any kind of settlement activities
7780165 i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together
7780166 the distance is nothing it is only the first step that is difficult
7780167 i think its no secret and i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think that settlement activity is helpful
7780168 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7780169 this investigation deals a major blow to a drug trafficking organization which operated primarily out of the city of chester
7780170 it drives a stake through the heart of an organization which has plagued the community with the scourge of illegal narcotics for a number of years
7780171 there is a good chance that if there is no movement the teachers will be out on strike on sept 2
7780172 were looking for cost containment they are asking for more benefits with no additional costs to them in the real world today thats not happening
7780173 i hope we will make enough progress monday that it will encourage them to continue to teach and negotiate until we come to a resolution
7780174 our first accountability is to the taxpayers of this district for the last three years they have gotten raises of about 2 2 percent our proposal is closer to that than to the unions demands
7780175 that would certainly be my fantasy but i dont know if thats going to happen
7780176 teachers will return to work without a contract and without significant progress being made in negotiations since january
7780177 as long as the two sides are talking and progress is being made thats a good thing
7780178 there is a good chance that if there is no movement the teachers will be out on strike on sept 2
7780179 were looking for cost containment they are asking for more benefits with no additional costs to them in the real world today thats not happening

7780181 that would certainly be my fantasy but i dont know if thats going to happen
7780182 we have a 1982 easement with peco energy from township line road in cromby up to fricks lock

7780184 our goal is to sign it uniformly and find access points and trailheads

7780202 la c mara de comercio nos propuso hacer este directorio virtual de establecimientos donde el turista tendr la oportunidad de ver los locales con sus fotos incluidas los precios medios y sus localizaciones nosotros agradecemos mucho el apoyo que se est dando a nuestro sector porque adem s de ser til para nosotros lo es para toda la ciudadan a
7780203 los d as en los que se ha decidido poner en marcha son especialmente adecuados por el evento deportivo se trata de dar un mejor servicio al visitante porque no s lo ofrecemos informaci n sobre nuestro patrimonio hist rico sino tambi n sobre nuestra gastronom a que es otra de las cosas que nos diferencia del resto
7780204 este es el punto de arranque para nosotros es un paso muy importante tener esta gu a en internet y lo hemos conseguido pero quiz con el tiempo se tendr que ir perfeccionando y ampliando tambi n el n mero de establecimientos y es probable que finalmente se haga en otro tipo de formatos
7780205 si el volumen del tr fico a reo lo determina y aumenta la demanda existe el proyecto del segundo edificio

7780210 quasi kneeling position placing the weight of his body on his legs
7780211 although it seems most likely brett katzenmoyer would be alive today if he had not ingested a high dose of morphine with sleeping pills it cannot be excluded that the head trauma incurred during the altercation with police did not play a deciding role
7780212 everyone whos involved in this supposed analysis of morphine levels
7780213 the beating by police is what put this guy in the hospital and put him on painkillers
7780214 it seems pretty clear to me that but for the beating hed be alive
7780215 theres going to be a lot more information coming in this case
7780216 later he reportedly tried to grab an officers gun outside the hospital emergency room
7780217 i was still thinking he was a police officer and that he was going to arrest me
7780218 he gave me heroin to do because he knew i was a heroin addict
7780219 i remember that i was crying and asking if he had a condom on
7780220 i told him i didnt think he was a police officer
7780221 there is a lot of misinformation people saying that all our kids are parolees with ankle bracelets
7780222 just like every other community deals with there will be more activity when schools going on but the students wont really be intermingling with the community
7780223 its always been a school we thought there really wasnt a need to go and do that
7780224 this is a very residential area we dont know what problems the kids are going to have because no ones bothered to tell us
7780225 this is literally a scandal as far as im concerned
7780226 to go ahead and do this without any community involvement it just seems wrong
7780227 what tom decided to do was a big mistake and will result in a lot of wrongdoers not being punished
7780228 john morganelli as a prosecutor should show more professionalism in commenting on an investigation that he knows nothing about other than what hes read in the newspaper
7780229 john morganelli has never conducted a public corruption investigation in his career so its not surprising that he wouldnt know how these investigations work
7780230 when you have conflicts of interests as tom corbett has in bonusgate they come back to haunt you down the road
7780231 and i believe in the end that is going to jeopardize the investigation
7780232 im still going to be doing a lot of stuff for the mayor i expect to be around not every day but a lot
7780233 i didnt want to have to feel guilty or to have to struggle to balance my vacation time with the citys needs
7780234 law school is more flexible thats one of the things they pay me to do go around talking about my work
7780235 if we cant be safe walking home in a place like kutztown then theres no place one can feel safe
7780236 what he did to kyle was cold blooded and cruel
7780237 please know that ive thought of your son every day and will every day of my life
7780238 im sorry to have put so many people through pain but im not just sorry for kyles family im sorry for my family and friends as well

7780250 because we dont want to get screwed in the event an insurance claim is denied to a respective business
7780251 its time we catch up with the resk of the casino computer programmer volunteers business community and offer solid fringe benefits for our valued employees this new package will come at no cost to employees and will be underwritten by a solid insurance company the premium charge will be higher but were banking on the fact that casino computer programmer volunteers product sales will increase because our workers will be highly motivated to come to work each day
7780252 our legal team has already thoroughly researched how to file an insurance claim for online business
7780253 mostly because we want to expedite the payout process should we have to make a claim the internet marketing world moves much faster than the physical marketing realm and as a result we would lose significant business from any down time associated with a drawn out insurance claim
7780254 just as we study car home or life insurance we will be studying online business insurance well be using special mathematic models to figure out the risk that casino computer programmer volunteers businesses bear against what would be deemed a reasonable insurance premium
7780255 once insurance companies buy into the online business sector theyre going to need able legal representation to avoid false claims likewise casino computer programmer volunteers businesses will need legal representation against these big time insurance companies in order to get the disbursements they deserve im excited about the possibilities
7780256 wed rather have a consistent share value over time versus a catastrophic loss of company value due to some frivalous lawsuit or liable charges the result of this decision will probably mean a 5 loss in share value for 6 months but then a slow steady recovery after that
7780257 because they currently have a limited health and dental plan we want to give them the most benefits and protect possible because they are our greatest assets people forget that the cost of losing an employee to another casino computer programmer volunteers company sometimes outweighs the cost of keeping them onboard

7780284 our work with trend micro will continue to support our self defending network vision and enhances our ability to provide end to end security that combines network application and content protection
7780285 trend micro is very pleased with the momentum we are building with cisco systems through the strengthening of our relationship with cisco we are continuing to further the delivery of security within the network infrastructure
7780286 our shared commitment to provide the most comprehensive and flexible network security solutions enables us to help protect customers against new classes of threats that are increasingly unpredictable and complex
7780287 the acquisition of ironport provides cisco with a proven business that is already respected as a leader in the messaging and web security space
7780288 the addition of ironport represents the next chapter in the evolution of the self defending network and it accelerates ciscos growth opportunities most important it dramatically extends the solutions we can provide our customers as security threats and demands evolve
7780289 ciscos acquisition of ironport underscores the convergence between secure content management and threat management needed to address todays complex threat environment
7780290 it departments have moved away from a focus on a single type of protection such as antivirus toward a broader focus on threats designed to get past point solution security and target multiple vulnerabilities in clients and corporate networks
7780291 ironport is known for building industry leading e mail appliances but when we introduced our web security appliance last year we realized the power of products working better together
7780292 our e mail products are better because we have a web product and vice versa merging this technology into ciscos self defending network portfolio creates even more powerful solutions for the marketplace

7780318 a decade after mandelbrot published his physiological speculations some theoretical biologists began to find fractal organization controlling structures all through the body the standard exponential description of a bronchial branching proved to be quite wrong a fractal description turned out to fit the data
7780319 i am conscious that i am in an utterly hopeless muddle i cannot think that the world as we see it is the result of chance and yet i cannot look at each separate thing as the result of design
7780320 no consequence of darwins theory of natural selection was a source of greater dismay to his opponents than the elimination of design from nature those who studied the countless superb adaptations of animals and plants had been most gratified by the explanation that such perfection was clearly the result of design by the maker of this world
7780321 but when we ask how this perfection is brought about we seem to find only arbitrariness planlessness randomness and accident
7780322 suppose space can be curved instead of flat a geometer says and the result is a weird curved parody of euclid that provides precisely the right framework for the general theory of relativity suppose space can have four dimensions or five or six suppose the number expressing dimension can be a fraction suppose shapes are defined not by solving an equation once but by iterating it repeating it in a feedback loop
7780323 and his exploration of infinitely complex shapes had an intellectual intersection a quality of self similarity above all fractal meant self similar
7780324 self similarity is symmetry across scale it implies recursion pattern inside of pattern mandelbrots price charts and river charts displayed self similarity because not only did they produce detail at finer and finer scales they also produced detail with certain constant measurements
7780325 some theoretical biologists began to find fractal organization controlling structures all through the body the standard exponential description of bronchial branching proved to be quite wrong a fractal description turned out to fit the data the urinary collecting system proved fractal the biliary duct in the liver the network of special fibers in the heart that carry pulses of electric current to the contracting muscles
7780326 mandelbrots point is that the complications exist only in the context of traditional euclidean geometry as fractals branching structures can be described with transparent simplicity with just a few bits of information
7780327 a home computer could handle arithmetic precise enough to make colorful pictures of the mandelbrot set and hobbyists quickly found that exploring these pictures at ever greater magnification gave a vivid sense of expanding scale if the set were thought of as a planet sized object a personal computer could show the whole object or features the size of cities or the size of buildings or the size of rooms or the size of books or the size of letters or the size of bacteria or the size of atoms the people who looked at such pictures saw that all the scales had similar patterns yet every scale was different and all these microscopic landscapes were generated by the same few lines of computer code
7780328 studying the electrical activity of the brains of rabbits trained to recognize various smells freeman finds that the animals brain waves shift to a different pattern of chaotic activity as each smell is inhaled
7780329 paul rapp of the university of pennsylvania has found similar results in humans when his subjects were asked to count backward from 100 by sevens their brain wave patterns suddenly shifted into a chaotic state that marked intense concentration
7780330 the bodys overall structure bears the signature of the chaotic processes that shape it right down to the dna molecule that serves as its genetic blueprint the fractal nature of dna appears to play a role in its ability to pass on biological information that controls development of the various parts of the body because fractals represent a midway point between randomness and predictability dnas fractal structure may represent a compromise between encoding the maximum amount of information while still being extremely resilient to damage
7780331 we get into a really interesting understanding of consciousness here the fundamental unit of consciousness happens to be a protein receptor and protein effector in combination if you separate either of these two proteins from each other then the unit of that perception is not made if you cut the receptor off no signals come in or if you cut the effector out then theres no response to the signal in either case you break the perception pathway
7780332 from the hypothetical organism that can see one percept meaning it would have just one receptor and effector so it can see only one thing to a human being who has an enormous range of awareness and enormous versatility in terms of response
7780333 in evolution functional groupings of plasmalemmal membrane imps invaginated and detached from the cell surface these internalized portions of the plasmalemma provided for the formation of discrete membranous organelles including the nucleus organization functional integration and mobility of the organelles was provided by the cytoskeletal matrix
7780334 a processor can hook a receptor to one output and another processor can hook the same receptor to a different output so that one incoming signal can be split by the processor into multiple functions over evolution the processor proteins are co ordinated or co ordinate themselves in such a way that the processor sub system has tremendous versatility in terms of its ability to get the most out of incoming signals the sub system might be able for instance to use just one incoming signal to provide a wide variety of biological functions
7780335 a mechanism of expanding the consciousness not just by increasing the numbers of receptors and effectors but by integrating them into functional biological repertoires
7780336 i was sitting in my laboratory looking at a eukaryotic cell through an electron microscope i was reiterating in my mind the common understanding that all the physiologic systems that can be found in the human being are in the eukaryotic cell when it really struck me the cell i was looking at was a fractal of the human being alternatively the human being is a fractal of the cell a version on a greater order of magnitude
7780337 evolutionary process is not that very very long uninterrupted upward inclined plane that the darwinists suppose it is
7780338 in terms of simple structures evolution is more like a ladder a fractal ladder which takes us us being the material realm into higher and higher consciousness the single cell from prokaryote to eukaryote is one rung of the ladder after this rung was completed nature took a bunch of state of the art eukaryotic cells and combined them into the first multicellular organism that first organism was the beginning of a new fractal rung a rung that is completed with the completion of the human being we humans are the eukaryotes of our fractal level
7780339 the story of evolution at the level of the single cell is largely the story of cell membrane expansion
7780340 the more membrane surface the more imps can be packed in at the level of the multicellular organism the maximizing of cellular membrane surface area is achieved through fractal packing the way to get the most surface area into any given three dimensional space is by means of fractal structuring

7780358 prime minister kevin rudd and consumer affairs minister chris bowen must acknowledge the absurdity of grocerychoice and shut the site down immediately
7780359 the council of small business has correctly highlighted the farcical nature of the grocerychoice website
7780360 they make the point that the site is misleading consumers because there is no reference to any specific stores
7780361 the sad reality is that this website could have a detrimental impact on the supermarket sector by providing free promotion to the major supermarket retailers
7780362 the website does not take into account the consumer savings from the convenience of independent stores and it does not take into account the price variations which exist within the independent sector and at different coles and woolworths stores
7780363 what that tells us is that consumers believe it is of no use at all

7780417 we are delighted with our new travel management partner and their introduction to the region wings has made a well respected name for itself over the last decade in africa the us and uk particularly in oil amp gas related corporate travel an area which the company has dominated and excelled in
7780418 the strategic decision for wings to enter the region at this time comes as no surprise particularly as the middle east offers an unparalleled opportunity for wings to capitalize on the regions oil amp gas industry
7780419 this is a significant step forward for wings as our corporate brand will be enhanced through our association with the ifa hotels amp resorts group you need only look at the ifa hotels amp resorts positioning and you will quickly see the tremendous value of being partnered with a company with such a premier portfolio of assets and who have rapidly established themselves as a major international player in the premier tourism segment
7780420 our clients are global multinational companies and in order to service these clients effectively we realized we needed to expand our position aligned with our strategy of providing clients with a seamless 24 7 service 365 days a year
7780421 dubai represents a logical entry point into the region given its growth over the years and the establishment of frameworks that encourage companies to set up their businesses furthermore almost all of our existing oil amp gas clients have significant operations based out of dubai
7780422 in addition our joint venture partnership provides us with a further opportunity to a deliver standardized and fully integrated travel solutions to our clients in the middle east one of the unique value propositions for the joint venture partnership is that the we operate as one company with seamless integration across all its operations
7780423 our clients and partners are also seeking out more effective corporate travel solutions well now be able to serve them through the wings offices in the uk and us this newly formed partnership will certainly enhance our high end travel and leisure offerings and also expand our business in africa and the indian ocean region

7780447 in most of those years the team had played well early but then faded away and finished ninth
7780448 but this time around we have done it on the back of young talent and ridden it home with seven wins in the last 10 matches in the latter part of the year
7780449 the difference between those two teams is this is more sustainable
7780450 we did that in 2006 with the second or third oldest team in the competition and were not able to achieve finals so you would think in that situation you are more likely to go down and up
7780451 but this time around we have got some good young players and along with melbourne we had the most players running around in the competition last week with 50 games or less to their names
7780452 we are on an improving graph and our challenge now is to ensure that continues

7780558 globalisierte finanzm rkte brauchen globale politische regulierung die bisherigen vorschl ge zur reform der finanzm rkte sind scheinheilig und v llig unzureichend anstatt das system grundlegend zu ver ndern zielen sie auf schadensbegrenzung ab dies liegt vor allem im interesse von gro en finanzinstituten konzernen und verm genden die kurzfristige jagd nach hohen renditen geht so weiterhin auf kosten der allgemeinheit
7780559 ihre trockenlegung w re einfacher als angenommen weil es sich zumeist um protektorate der industrienationen handelt und sie vom freien kapitalverkehr abh ngig sind
7780560 die immer absurderen ausw chse an gewinnstreben und undurchschaubaren hochriskanten finanzinstrumenten haben keinen volkswirtschaftlichen nutzen

7780633 das erste jahr hat gezeigt dass wien das potential hat sich mit einem festival international zu positionieren
7780634 die sterreichische design szene braucht eine plattform wie diese zur sichtbarmachung und zum austausch auf internationalem niveau es ist unser ziel ein unabh ngiges programm f r die zukunft zu entwickeln das nachhaltig wien als design stadt st rkt
7780635 design begleitet uns st ndig es bereichert und erleichtert oftmals den alltag wird aber erst durch veranstaltungen wie die vdw deutlich sichtbar gemacht design ist als wesentlicher teil der creative industries ein wichtiger und dynamischer wirtschaftsfaktor f r unsere stadt der einsatz von design kann den entscheidenden wettbewerbsvorteil bringen dies muss noch st rker bewusst gemacht werden deshalb freue ich mich dass mit departure die stadt wien wieder partner der vdw ist und bin schon jetzt auf das vielseitige programm gespannt

7780641 ich bin berzeugt dass barack ein au ergew hnlicher pr sident sein wird
7780642 wir werden allen amerikanern auf diesem parteitag zeigen warum wir barack obama und joe biden im wei en haus brauchen

7780646 my hunch is that we are unlikely to be there because the majority sentiment in the party leadership is that we will be giving mugabe a platform to masquerade as a legitimate president when we dont recognise him as such

7780648 from our exit poll figures and what we are tracking anwar is safely leading in the polls and i think that it is right to say about 61 percent

7780650 we are expecting anwars win to be the same as big as when wan azizah contested but we think that it will be less in terms of absolute numbers due to it being a working day for many
7780651 chinese and indian voters are not coming out as much as we had expected this could be due to intimidation
7780652 we are trying to round them up to come out and vote
7780653 we appeal to the people of kashmir to continue peaceful protests
7780654 we strongly condemned the excessive use of force against the unarmed protesters
7780655 during three months of violent protests in jammu police have killed three hindus just three hindus
7780656 and in just two weeks these people have killed more than 30 people muslims this simple mathematics tells you india treats us like slaves
7780657 more than a dozen ambulance drivers were beaten up by crpf and equal number of ambulances were damaged by them crpf
7780658 euheart is a very exciting project that will bring together the latest advances in modeling and computing to improve the care of patients with heart disease
7780659 it may ultimately allow us to select and optimize the best treatment for individual patients
7780660 the development of computer models that integrate structural and functional information of the heart and then personalize it to individual patients is a mammoth task that will require the multi disciplinary effort of researchers with strong know how in biophysical modeling and image processing clinical experts and engineers in the device and imaging industries
7780661 in the euheart project we are confident that we have brought together the necessary expertise and that we can make a real contribution to improving the treatment of one of the worlds killer diseases
7780662 turning backs on patients hhs fails to deliver on contraception conscience proposal
7780663 when pregnancy begins what an abortion is what contraception does and give
7780664 targeting provider conscience can be a shell game for attacking access to contraception and abortion if contraception and abortion are what providers consciences are telling them not to provide
7780665 doesnt mean the regulations as written wouldnt undermine those laws anyway
7780666 from nuanced to principled the lessons of pastor rick and why and how obama and the democrats should make abortion a voting issue
7780667 million dollar question is how to talk about an issue
7780668 that requires nuance in a way that is succinct principled and captures our gut level sensibilities
7780669 if democrats continue to parry republican war cries of baby killer with emotionally bland or euphemistic phrases like reproductive health or continue to couch the debate in terms of life vs choice offering ambivalent voters a hobsons choice they do indeed have something to worry about
7780670 language of choice is not in fact the most compelling way to engage most americans on abortion it doesnt resonate with most voters in the center and it activates negative stereotypes about feminism and promiscuity
7780671 barack obamas saddleback misspeak and drew westens lessons on abortion talk
7780672 good and emphasizes some excellent points about obamas and any politicians discussion of these issues
7780673 myth that anyone believes that abortion should be an option late in pregnancy
7780674 in order to reach common ground voters will not help our issues gain traction long term
7780675 pretending to speak for the pro life community and giving a pass to the most extreme pro abortion candidate ever to be nominated for president
7780676 first black woman to represent ohio in congress weve lost an incredible advocate for womens reproductive rights and health care for all
7780677 in the world that i study everybodys trying to kill the biofilm
7780678 but theres not a concrete answer for that and thats why you need to understand methods
7780679 thats why we can be one of the few labs in the world that can focus on methods development
7780680 every time a person buys a product with an epa approved efficacy claim such as kills 99 percent of bacteria the public trusts the validity of the process used to prove that claim
7780681 our goal is to grow bacteria in a way thats relevant to how the bacteria exist where the product is used
7780682 that way we can have more confidence in the products actual effectiveness and so can the public
7780683 so many results depend on the process a person uses
7780684 to have only one way to grow a biofilm isnt going to cut it
7780685 lives are being put at risk a programme needs to be put into place to ensure that all british children are inoculated against hepatitis b
7780686 it is a matter of public health much of the rest of europe operates mass childhood vaccination programmes it is time that the uk followed suit
7780687 in the uk the government only vaccinates those deemed to be at high risk but evidence shows that this policy is failing a recent investigation into nhs use of the vaccine found only half of gp practices are following clinical guidelines on protecting patients this is leaving millions of patients at risk of a preventable disease the government itself has revealed that prisoners who are particularly at risk are left exposed to infection
7780688 routine vaccination of all infants against hbv infection should become an integral part of national immunisation schedules worldwide
7780689 its going to be 5 000 toward every familys purchase of health insurance something that basically would be a non event for people already getting insurance from their employer but for those who are buying it out of pocket a lot of help there
7780690 what we estimate is that sen obamas health plan would reduce the cost of health care by about 2 500 for a typical family thats a combination of direct out of pocket costs that the family no longer has to make and premium payments from their employers that families are now paying in the lower wages that they receive
7780691 most people with allergies are atopic meaning they have a genetic tendency to develop allergies to detect the genetic factors we examined the genomes of more than 10 000 adults and children from the whole of germany
7780692 we found that there are a variety of behaviors learning disabilities and emotional problems that are unique to patients with xxyy syndrome that may be better addressed with more targeted therapies
7780693 our research is important because it provides an accurate picture of what patients are experiencing that can help physicians who treat patients with the disorder
7780694 until now physicians have had to search the medical literature to patch together a treatment plan mostly based on information on klinefelter syndrome
7780695 as a result people with xxyy werent being screened for the specific medical problems associated with their disorder they werent receiving therapies or medications for the behavioral and neurodevelopmental issues that are more profound for them and they werent receiving the types of community services that can help them live independent lives our research is an important resource for families and practitioners
7780696 life skills are more of a struggle for these males and they may need different medications a broader array of behavioral therapies and more intensive community support than those with klinefelter syndrome
7780697 we were tired of having our families running around the country looking for answers from people who didnt have them
7780698 the more we talked the more we realized our boys had things in common that were not addressed in the literature
7780699 kyle knows that people dont understand xxyy and therefore dont understand him as a person she said
7780700 the study helps the world know why he is like he is it validates what he knows about himself and what we know about him when he cant follow directions its not because hes stupid
7780701 a new look at xxyy syndrome medical and psychological features
7780702 reactive oxygen species lead to oxidative stress in the body which can also cause dna damage we were able to gather clear evidence of a short term increase in certain indicators for oxidative stress during the competition and have already published these results however now we were also able to demonstrate that despite this increase no notable and persistent damage was caused to the athletes dna this is a surprising result which initially appears to contradict the data gathered in similar studies
7780703 the comparable studies analysed different biomarkers for predominantly short lived dna damage our study focused primarily on damage to dna that was subsequently evident in daughter cells following cell division and could therefore be of long term detriment to the body however we can sound the all clear in this respect our study clearly shows that in this case extreme competitive sport did not result in any increase in dna damage
7780704 no acute and persistent dna damage after an ironman triathlon
7780705 this is a targeted enforcement operation that is part of an ongoing ice investigation that has revealed that illegal aliens are employed at howard industries
7780706 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs
7780707 it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
7780708 we gave them refuge because they were afraid to go back to their homes
7780709 everybodys crying worried about whats going to happen to him
7780710 there is always fear of something like this but with these raids we know now its real
7780711 these raids have really highlighted the difficulties towns face in this situation
7780712 im not sure all of these towns have an ability to cope and provide the crisis intervention
7780713 its a different community than when i was growing up for sure
7780714 we have zero tolerance for employing people who are not authorized to work in the u s and use all available tools provided by the u s government to verify the documents of the people we hire
7780715 you can see that people are more scared in general
7780716 some of them they dont even tell you directly but people dont go outside like they used to and things like that
7780717 he cannot be 100 percent cured but his life quality has improved if once he depended on others to do his activities now he can eat by himself use his hand to write use the cell phone
7780718 we sent him home so he can gather with his family again especially ahead of the fasting month it will mentally help the healing process
7780719 my hunch is that we are unlikely to be there because the majority sentiment in the party leadership is that we will be giving mugabe a platform to masquerade as a legitimate president when we dont recognize him as such
7780720 we are also in a difficult position because our national chairman lovemore moyo is now the speaker and we have to decide how to proceed we will have a decision in probably an hour
7780721 we have taken this decision after we failed to find any ray of hope and none of the commitments made to us were fulfilled
7780722 we are sad over nawaz sharifs decision we want to move together and solve the problems facing the nation
7780723 we will request nawaz sharif to return to the government
7780724 i dont anticipate it would have any impact on our joint efforts to combat extremism

7780726 i think its no secret and i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think that settlement activity is helpful
7780727 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7780728 the peace process is not and should not be affected by any kind of settlement activities
7780729 i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together
7780730 we havent heard anything about it so we cannot confirm these rumours as we have no contact with her at all
7780731 we are trying to know more the only person who has seen her is the doctor
7780732 he cannot be 100 percent cured but his life quality has improved if once he depended on others to do his activities now he can eat by himself use his hand to write use the cell phone
7780733 we sent him home so he can gather with his family again especially ahead of the fasting month it will mentally help the healing process

7780738 to make the reader appreciate once hes stopped foaming at the mouth that the external world need not always conform to his hopes and expectations it forces one to think which is why so many dislike it

7780767 theres been a big shift in philosophy theres much more year round hockey taking place
7780768 that certainly lends itself to kids dropping out of the game earlier than historically they would have they might be getting a lifetimes worth of hockey in a shorter period of time
7780769 its never been my favourite thing to do in the world

7780773 some of the data we have shows they spent a lot more time playing at their sport in an unorganized way
7780774 we see a lot of kids who play the same way
7780775 were getting into structure so early were sucking the life out of the game in a lot of ways

7780834 youre still subject to additional screening and clearance when you come to the airport
7780835 you can understand why i am a little bit dubious about tsa
7780836 why cant they find a way to simply delete the people they know should not be on the lists how hard is that
7780837 you cant check in online or print out your boarding pass in advance
7780838 you have to wait in line at the ticket counter and show them your license and tell them you need to be cleared
7780839 the guys with all their credentials looped around their necks are just like the guys who go on spring break in cancun and keep all their wristbands from the bars and clubs they went to the night before
7780840 those of us who are here but arent delegates are always trying to get down on the convention floor and we never know if we will be able to do it until the very end
7780841 you can just switch off credentials if someone down on the floor wants to give theirs up

7780844 i think we can match them once we are up to scratch on the day i have played in the mls and the difference in the standard of play isnt great we have some good talent in our squad as well and some experience too i believe once we can settle early and work to our plan then a good result is a definite possibility

7780860 essentially we want fast processing but also very secure processing customer confidence is extremely important in the online gaming economy industry and we aim to be one of the top businesses in this market in order to do that business transactions must be clean
7780861 weve got three players all vying for the same market search buy and process google and microsoft have the software and search technology while paypal boasts the most friendly payment processing online all the same google would probably prefer to vertically consolidate this process under their control while hopefully avoiding anti trust and or monopoly issues
7780862 older folks are skeptical of making purchases online fearing identity theft or unscrupulous retailers
7780863 but when they see others buying things with no problems they quickly opt to try it the newfangled way online
7780864 weve slowly moved away from check processing to credit card sales
7780865 mostly because check processing takes days and credit cards are almost instant further if the check bounces and weve sold a online gaming economy product it can take a month to track down the delinquent account holder and get our money back with credit cards its up to the respective bank to come up with the money
7780866 because i have a student credit card that allows me to make internet purchases without it id be paying double or triple for my books at the school bookstore whereas online i can find books second hand for a third of the price
7780867 im excited to be starting up this new e wallet
7780868 because weve noted a huge demand for online gaming economy transactions online in order to meet this demand were going to need high end it and fresh programming platforms with these two elements teamed together we believe we can provide payment solutions for online gaming economy companies and many others
7780869 and are also practically built into the internet its second nature to them unlike those in older demographics who have more money to purchase online gaming economy items but choose to do offline

7780874 the church is one institution that does not live for itself
7780875 the one who sows the good seed is the son of man the field is the world and the good seed are the children of the kingdom the weeds are the children of the evil one and the enemy who sowed them is the devil the harvest is the end of the age and the reapers are angels

7780905 my guess nonetheless would be that the shetland msp would win through
7780906 i think teaching this story will be highly educational for my middle eastern gaming policy students irregardless of what critics believe
7780907 heck if we always listened to critics nothing would be sold they serve a purpose but i leave the fact checking to qualified historians and researchers
7780908 were releasing lynes lapps work online in a weeks time
7780909 im happy we were able to release my middle eastern gaming policy book on time
7780910 timing is crucial in this market and luckily we chose the right publishers for the job
7780911 this book speaks volumes about the impact of middle eastern gaming policy in society and we knew from a business responsibility stand point that releasing it on time would really make a difference
7780912 with the release of swatek garietys new middle eastern gaming policy book were going to see record traffic levels
7780913 it will be a top seller im sure and even though it is meant for those familiar with the middle eastern gaming policy literary world many others may find it of general interest as well
7780914 i think steffanie burklands new docu novel leads readers astray there is too much focus on making the fictional characters function whereas more attention should have been paid to the facts

7780917 and we expect to sell out very fast patrina nists middle eastern gaming policy book brought hundreds of pre sale orders and numerous bulk order requests so the question of whether or not well sell out is moot
7780918 in the literary world we seek to heighten public awareness about the middle eastern gaming policy industry and how it works this is absolutely essential for those in the academic literary and research fields
7780919 because the work that has been done in the middle eastern gaming policy literary area has been huge

7780923 the story printed in the glasgow sunday herald claiming a security breach of best western guest information is grossly unsubstantiated
7780924 claims reported about our central reservations customer records are not accurate
7780925 the sunday herald reporter brought to our attention the possible compromise of a select portion of data at a single hotel we investigated immediately and provided commentary
7780926 best western would have welcomed the opportunity to fact check the story which would have resulted in more accurate and credible reporting on the part of the newspaper
7780927 we have found no evidence to support the sensational claims ultimately made by the reporter and newspaper

7781083 it is important to stress that no one connected to crescent radio is a member of hizb ut tahrir or any other organisation like that but my concern is that hizb ut tahrir members views were being aired without a counter argument being provided
7781084 no one was advocating violence or terrorism and i appreciate it is a community station and cannot be managed and monitored 24 hours a day but there still should have been safeguards in place so the station gives a balanced view
7781085 if someone said to me islamic culture is about extremism and terrorism i would rightly be very offended because it is a false generalisation and it was that kind of thing which i was concerned about
7781086 we do not ban anybody but i do agree that one or two presenters have invited some guests on too often
7781087 we are a community station and we do give our presenters a bit of leeway to run the shows how they like
7781088 but i have been explicit in the guidelines i have given them
7781089 we are about giving the community a voice and bringing communities together and that means giving people of all types of belief a platform to air their views
7781090 i was very impressed by the quality of the entries and the enthusiasm put in
7781091 there is no god but allah and muhammad is his messenger
7781092 i know theres frustration and it would make my job easier if i could give out the facts that i know but we have obligations to our partners we discuss it constantly and the company would like to be more upfront about this but we cant be
7781093 when i found we had this problem i went to the oems and said lets fix this
7781094 in fact i put a reserve of 200m in place and i said to the oems if you fix it ill pay you back
7781095 not marvell not broadcom not amd but if the consumer has a failure well get it replaced right away
7781096 the first person in the world that talked about this problem was me

7781110 they would be as successful today as they were in their own era because of their ability to adapt not only to their audiences but to the era they were playing in
7781111 they had a very unique ability to integrate themselves into any audience demographic
7781112 it really helps from on high to have somebody that you revere that you care about and want to hear what theyre saying and doing and what theyre wearing everything
7781113 thats important for us whether its an apparition or not
7781114 people are looking back now because were in a very similar situation to 68 an unpopular war an unpopular president whos waging it serious domestic problems
7781115 people ached to feel noble in 1968 and they ache to feel noble again
7781116 people sense theres a similarity between the two periods and it makes the kennedys more interesting to them
7781117 i dont think the american people know them very well
7781118 they do a lot of good humanitarian work but if i was to have to name them i think i would have a hard time
7781119 it is time again for a new generation of leadership it is time now for barack obama
7781120 a few folks in the santa fe and albuquerque area like wilson and the foundation who are already ahead of the curve
7781121 in light of the economic times i think folks are looking into doing something different
7781122 still working on some kinks in getting to where we need to be
7781123 indeed pay for itself in about 20 years but this time is reduced to 10 years when federal and state tax credits are factored in also thanks to some forward thinking of elected or appointed officials in new mexico there is no state sales tax on this equipment
7781124 when you do shop at the grocery store its very limited they dont have a very wide selection
7781125 i think if we had a farmers market i think we would shop more and eat more produce
7781126 were already outpacing 2007 so i think were going to see significant growth
7781127 it helps the local farmer it helps the families both stretch their food dollars and makes sure they are getting access to fruits and vegetables

7781131 common welfare and infused with a good dose of spirituality
7781132 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7781133 clearly we found there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified them
7781134 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7781135 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7781136 youre here to learn and focus on education youre going to have to confirm to a standardized code of dress in the real world so we might as well start now they can dress like they want to on the weekend or after school
7781137 i cannot find shirts for girls with three buttons and no logos
7781138 i dont blame the school i blame her mom for letting her walk out like that
7781139 im going to be totally hot if i have to come up to school and get my girls out of school for a button
7781140 it doesnt matter if you come from a million dollar home or a 50 000 home
7781141 this extremist phenomenon exists in many arabo muslim countries in many countries in the muslim world in general
7781142 you cant call what has happened here a real terrorist threat
7781143 sure there are young people who were in al qaeda but they are isolated cases maybe 20 people who travelled abroad to fight for al qaeda
7781144 but i think in mauritania it isnt on a big scale
7781145 the forces of defence and security have done everything to end it and they are still working
7781146 what we can guarantee is that we will not spare any effort to eradicate this evil
7781147 its true that the armed struggle isnt the only effective way of dealing with this we also have to find the roots of all these problems that are developing and to treat them too in other ways
7781148 when he was elected he released a lot of prisoners who he wrongly believed were falsely imprisoned and he and his prime minister said terrorism did not exist
7781149 so the security forces went to sleep and we all saw what happened
7781150 general abdelaziz in fact the two generals who led the putsch were in charge of destroying al qaeda theyre seen as enemies of al qaeda so its possible there could be more attacks
7781151 but i think we could finally get a really essential thing something we have never had a real strategy for fighting against terrorism
7781152 they want to see if there is any interest there
7781153 i was told all along that if something were to happen that this is a position i could find myself in
7781154 i am ready to step in there and hopefully there wont be a letdown at all
7781155 we are going to go forward with the players that we have
7781156 and we are always looking for and searching for people who can help our team and nothing is going to change with regard to that
7781157 i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now how could you not want him back
7781158 wouldnt that be something he comes back and we start a trend
7781159 as i know it he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind today
7781160 he has not been bouncing back and forth like favre
7781161 he has been pretty happy we saw him up here and he said he missed it but he was content he has decided to go on to the next phase of his life so i dont look too strongly into that him playing again
7781162 it is something that he all of us really wanted but obviously we didnt want these circumstances for him to get back
7781163 it is a good thing for him it is a good thing for this team he is definitely a d lineman at heart and hopefully he can just come back in and not miss a beat
7781164 he is another one of those infectious personalities so his personality and his mind state are always going to be at the utmost highest so i am not worried about him on that point
7781165 people just dont know if they are ready for the change candidate

7781168 the internet moves so fast its hard to compete with
7781169 bloggers beat me to the stories most of the time but on several occasions in the past ive been able to get to the source first and report the most reliable information available to me
7781170 as soon as our paper hit the presses i put the stories on all major wires
7781171 and response from beyond was instantaneous phone calls from various high volume news agencies rained in seeking further coverage and dibbs on the rest of the gaming website design story
7781172 but after about five years of experience i can say that it has become much easier and more exciting
7781173 its best to have a solid foundation in english and writing
7781174 and with time and experience youll become a pro at gaming website design reporting in no time
7781175 and i intend to harness its power to better inform everyone about various gaming website design happenings in our area
7781176 and i want to be very careful about releasing the most reliable and pertinent information related to this gaming website design issue possible
7781177 its surprising to finally read this gaming website design news
7781178 i thought all those rumors were just rumors but now i see that there is some truth to them after all
7781179 i knew it all along everyone told me my thoughts about the gaming website design news stories were hyped up but now we all see that i was right on kudos to reporter luttman gedeon for an excellent piece
7781180 after my stint with the daily news i moved over to investigative reporting
7781181 and i found my home i love investigative journalism particularly in the gaming website design industry where there is always a juicy story to be told furthermore it is of great benefit to our community to report such news

7781246 we played some excellent football this is a difficult place to come so it is a bonus to come here and win
7781247 we tried to play a system where the players would be comfortable we wanted to have anderson playing centrally close to carlos tevez we let paul scholes control the game and used darren fetchers energy
7781248 i thought i was a very even game up until they scored the way the first half went i was well pleased we tired in the second half as we had a few lads who hadnt played but i am not too despondent
7781249 come the end of the season we will be up there again in the top ten no problem because we have so many talented players and a good team
7781250 we have three or four players who havent played for a while and missed a pre season and i had to throw them in and take a chance on them the work rate was much better today and you couldnt fault the effort i thought we played okay
7781251 most of these technologies fall into the legacy systems capacity and are being replaced by more modern technologies
7781252 take ibm mainframe systems as an example once the hub of all the major banks many are now looking at or have replaced their core banking systems with modern enterprise resource planning erp solutions from major vendors such as sap and oracle as such there is little fresh development on these systems
7781253 the focus is more on maintenance until they are replaced so demand is definitely not as great as it was a few years ago
7781254 in general most it skills have not become redundant though there is a fall in the number of onsite assignments and relatively fewer new jobs
7781255 new technologies emerge faster in the it industry compared to other industries
7781256 it professionals that are in job categories which are no longer experiencing good growth should consider transforming themselves
7781257 without doubt transformation demands strong commitment and good effort on the part of the individual but alternative job options are in abundance and one can choose new job categories that closely parallel their interest and experience
7781258 most it companies have in house resource centers e learning tools and a published training calendar for organization sponsored training programs
7781259 in addition to in house programs employees could consider taking up programs organized by external academies
7781260 it employees are also expected to keep themselves equipped with skills to handle newer versions of the technologies in which they have skills
7781261 often employers will tempt workers whose skills are declining in demand with good salaries as the companies need them to stay to work on these technologies before they are replaced
7781262 my advice is for employees to try and get experience with newer technologies and understand what systems are growing in demand
7781263 if you are working with older systems speak with your manager and agree to work on the older systems but also make an agreement that you be given the opportunity to gain experience with other systems so your skills dont become redundant
7781264 if the worst happens and you suddenly find yourself unemployed with skills that are no longer in demand look at whats in demand and that interests you and try and get some training or commercial experience in the area

7781292 the gcc is leading the way in the development of power production facilities which is focused on supplying the growing power requirement at a more economical cost
7781293 with government bodies focusing on ensuring that there is adequate power supply to sustain development we have identified the outstanding prospect in aiding their initiatives by providing highly secure power protection equipment which not only facilitates continuous electricity supply but enables power conservation as well
7781294 the way to find out how people are truly feeling about the current business and economic conditions in a particular country is through gaining insights into consumer opinion in conducting surveys such as these on a periodical basis it is possible to compare current attitudes and how they change over a particular period which provides a sound basis for all hr professionals and industry stakeholders to understand key economic trends and develop business strategies that will work in the changing business environment
7781295 while the consumer confidence index is a lagging indicator and does not necessarily predict economic performance it does reflect the mood of consumers in the market place this inevitably has some impact on the choices that these consumers make as to the products they buy and the places they shop and highlights which purchases they deem to be optional while intentions to buy have not dropped significantly what we are likely to see are people making choices based on value the winners will be brands that have developed strong bonds with their customers and those that offer better value for money
7781296 in conducting this research we can learn how people feel about their current salaries which provides some very telling indicators an overwhelming 68 of respondents across the region said salaries havent increased with rising living costs with only 20 finding they have in the uae almost three quarters of people 72 said their salary hadnt kept pace marking a significant continued increase from the 61 of respondents in aprils survey interestingly it was respondents in the levant countries of jordan syria and lebanon again that were hardest hit by salary vis vis cost of living
7781297 all types of stakeholders from recruitment industry professionals and organisations like bayt com to major industry leaders look to this type of relevant and beneficial quantitative data to determine a clear picture of peoples true feelings on the current economic situation in their country of residence offering insights into work including career growth potential remuneration and general sentiments towards the prevailing environment as the consumer confidence index does allows for all players to understand where and how improvements can be made for ensuring a better future especially in challenging economic times
7781298 in spite of ghanas economic challenges it has joined china and india to become the toast of major developed and industrialised economies

7781300 we see the banking or financial services sector as the most positioned sector to reap the expected benefits of the oil within the medium to long term
7781301 if you are only a crow dont try to be an eagle
7781302 wontum tackle ellembelle blay he is our man brumia twum the stubborn child has climbed a tall tree and fallen heavily to break his leg
7781303 my victory is for the entire party i will continue to serve you because i have the development of the constituency at heart i believe all of us will remain united to make a big difference in this years elections
7781304 we are sure of winning the elections so dont follow the line of our detractors who have vowed to make the pending elections a do or die affair
7781305 maybe as a nation we have been overlooking some of the essential ingredients for boosting good work ethos
7781306 every organisation or country that wants to grow must necessarily adopt strategic marketing concepts
7781307 while developed countries are working 24 7 ghanaians work for just 8 hours a day for 5 days and yet would expect their country to be developed if we are not careful human resource would have to be imported
7781308 we must eschew maligning pilfering and all sorts of negative activities that downplay our economys progress
7781309 it is important for us as cadres to wake up pick up the pieces put them together
7781310 this would help ensure that our organisation is revived to enable us recapture our rightful places in the development of our dear nation for which we have already made enormous sacrifices
7781311 if we can learn the lessons of history and correct our past mistakes then we can move ahead with confidence otherwise the same fate of losing elections and remaining in opposition will continue to be with us
7781312 it was rather an unfortunate emotional decision which cost us dearly because it broke the organisational front we must therefore use reasoning rather than emotions to work
7781313 while the npp is enjoying all the good works that the ndc handed over to them they continue to paint a negative picture about our achievements to ghanaians at the same time they are feeding fat on the things that the ndc created
7781314 we must set the records straight otherwise the spirits of our comrades who laid down their lives for you and i to reach this far as well as posterity will not forgive us
7781315 there is now a lot of apathy passiveness and worst of all wanton scramble to enrich oneself at the expense of the nation things have turned the other way round unlike the days when cadres rather enriched the state at our own expense
7781316 dr bawumia will begin the tour with a visit to his fathers grave side followed by a visit to the nayiri king of mamprugu
7781317 this will be followed by visits to other parts of the northern upper west and upper east regions in each of these regions dr bawumia and his team will visit traditional rulers religious leaders and party members the visit will end with a town hall meeting in tamale on the first of september 2008
7781318 if he wasnt so strong a character he would probably just fold and that doesnt help anybody
7781319 i dont understand why some people come and hammer one player from the start as it doesnt help him or me
7781320 in the first half the passion and tempo wasnt there while the work rate certainly wasnt there
7781321 we deserved to be 1 0 down at half time but in the second half we should have got something out of the game
7781322 the work rate was good and the tempo was up but if you dont do that for 90 minutes then you are going to get beaten

7781329 ensure that we can present only the highest quality news articles
7781330 putting more pressure on news organisations to improve their professional and ethical standards and to listen to the people who consume their products
7781331 in order to operate from china we have removed some content from the search results available on google cn in response to local law regulation or policy
7781332 while removing search results is inconsistent with googles mission providing no information or a heavily degraded user experience that amounts to no information is more inconsistent with our mission

7781337 im passionate about the environment and health and well being on all levels of personal care
7781338 people with sensitivities to regular over the counter cosmetics containing artificial fragrance parabens sulfates and many other harsh chemicals are especially happy to at last find hair care body care and make up that they can use red room has been a great discovery for so many who want to live chemical free
7781339 theres a great sense of gratification when you do your part in protecting the environment
7781340 you cant just say its x86 so its going to solve the massively parallel computing problem
7781341 with an os they dont control and applications coming from everywhere
7781342 multi processing is a hard problem in computer science its been there for 30 years its not answered by software tools
7781343 theyve put out a certain amount of technical disclosure in the past five weeks
7781344 but although they make larrabee sound like its a fundamentally better approach it snt they dont tell you the assumptions they made they talk about scaling but they disregard memory bandwidth they make it sound good but we say you neglected half a dozen things
7781345 every gpu we make we always consider this type of design we do a reasoned analysis and we always conclude no thats why we havent built that type of machine
7781346 as blogger and cpu architect peter glaskowsky said the large larrabee in 2010 will have roughly the same performance as a 2006 gpu from nvidia or ati
7781347 weve looked very closely at this and we know there are certain things we can do better there will be improvements to things from all angles there are some easy fixes in the software domain that will soon be forthcoming believe me its a very prime focus of ours
7781348 ati has had the benefit for a long time of seeing nvidias products and having something to shoot for
7781349 while nvidia has not had the benefit of having someone to be shooting after
7781350 ati did not spend on things like physx and cuda but we believe that people value things beyond graphics if you compare only on graphics thats a relative disadvantage to us but the notion of what you measure a gpu on will change and evolve
7781351 were forward looking and sometimes when someones forward looking they get a little bit ahead of the game and thats kind of where we are
7781352 joining both components on the same die doesnt buy you that much
7781353 its not like theres a real bottleneck there and every square millimeter you add to the die is a very expensive millimeter its an incremental expense not a linear function its cheaper to separate them
7781354 the class of buyer who buys that type of graphics isnt really buying graphics
7781355 the groups performance in the first half together with our growth potential supports the boards view that rio tinto presents a very strong standalone value proposition for shareholders
7781356 while the equity markets are currently focused on downside risks we believe there are potential offsets on the upside based on continued strength in commodity demand low inventory levels and a supply side which continues to face multiple constraints
7781357 the group continues to perform strongly and the outlook remains positive
7781358 i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming
7781359 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
7781360 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7781361 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7781362 scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves
7781363 has been a fighter for the hispanic community a fighter for immigration
7781364 is not just choosing a yes man but a person that will speak what he believes
7781365 if we can find players of the right quality and who will add to what we have here already then we will see what is out there
7781366 it is not a case of just bringing bodies in they have to be of the right quality and players who can move us forward
7781367 the sale of rolando bianchi and the possible move of nery castillo mean that there is the opportunity and the means to bring people in and we will be investigating the possibility
7781368 its been quite active over the years but this is the biggest we have experienced for a few years

7781373 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so f king smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what f ck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
7781374 mi considero molto fortunata perch inutile negarlo il successo di amy winehouse mi ha fatto gioco e visto che alcuni suoi brani sono nelle mie corde in qualche modo qualcuno ci ha paragonate ma sono convinta del fatto che ci che ci accomuna si riduce unicamente a questo

7781377 it is between michael and the club but in an ideal world we would all like his contract sorted out sooner rather than later
7781378 at the same time though he has got the rest of the season with his current contract
7781379 michael is a world renowned centre forward and a world renowned goalscorer when he leads us out it sends a message to other teams
7781380 it tells them that we have some real quality in our side he is the most world renowned player we have at the club

7781384 an atmosphere of peace tolerance non violence and forbearance as one people with a common destiny of attaining a middle income status by year 2015 through good political governance
7781385 there is indeed the need for a strong media presence and participation at all functions and events in the run up during and after the elections
7781386 to enable us all to create that atmosphere to necessitate clean campaign devoid of enmity rancour maligning vilification of character of the key players that will contest
7781387 with this law now operational it is expected that importers will benefit from the removal of duties and other taxes and subsequently pass on such benefits to the end consumers
7781388 importers are reminded that it should be criminal for anybody to re export these duty free items

7781407 is inconsistent with your stations obligations under federal communications commission regulations
7781408 obama supporters have now sent more than 93 000 e mails to the sinclair stations that have decided to run the ad
7781409 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
7781410 how much do your really know about barack obama what does he really believe
7781411 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
7781412 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
7781413 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
7781414 the fact that obama is launching his own convention by defending his long association with a man who says he didnt bomb enough u s targets tells us more about barack obama than any of tonights speeches will

7781487 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
7781488 the government could also do more to promote the scheme its interesting how when they want money off you they make it clear what you need to do but when the boot is on the other foot its impossible to get hold of them
7781489 on the face of it sbrr is a good idea and it does appear to be working however i am sceptical about it i am concerned that because it was rushed in in the future there will be additional hikes in business rates
7781490 eligible ratepayers must apply for the relief each year businesses which have not yet applied for sbrr are running out of time as the deadline for applications this year is 30 september

7781493 concerns about credit risks both in the united states and japan are still strong there are also worries about the global
7781494 the fixed income markets are signalling to central banks the need to prepare for protracted sub trend growth

7781499 its going to be done on time i have no doubts
7781500 it appeared that price stabilization has become more and more consistent
7781501 house prices have stabilized and tremendous drops that have occurred in the process are probably centered around a lot of sub prime sales that have depressed overall prices
7781502 while more housing related indicators reveal continued problems there is some increasing evidence that the supply and demand may be moving more into balance especially in many metropolitan markets in illinois
7781503 he said next year people are going to look back at august 2008 and will be saying to themselves that we should have bought a home in 2008
7781504 the market has turned itself around but we had to pay a very high price
7781505 the husband i fell in love with and married is not the same person
7781506 he wanted to know if the diocese ever knew that anything had happened
7781507 im very angry at them its affected our family its affected our kids its affected our faith
7781508 although the practice is still relatively uncommon more and more businesses are requesting this form of job application

7781514 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7781515 shes the best stepmom sam lola and cassandra could ever hope for seeing her love and affection with those three i know shell be an amazing mom unless i bat 100 percent perhaps a boy awaits us
7781516 brooke found out for sure on friday and is thrilled to death
7781517 brooke loves charlie very much and has wanted a baby for some time
7781518 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
7781519 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7781520 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
7781521 their big challenge is convincing people that they will continue to be active in politics and theyre going to continue to have a voice
7781522 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
7781523 an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections and was seeking to redeem himself to those closest to him yes that is who i supported
7781524 she knew she should not have participated in him running for president with this bomb waiting to go off she did she kinda loses my sympathy
7781525 i believe we are all owed a huge apology not self serving claims for pity by both john and elizabeth edwards who both knew about the affair and both decided to go forward and seek the democratic candidacy regardless of the titanic risk
7781526 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
7781527 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
7781528 i thought it was very naive on both their parts
7781529 it would be very sad if he were the nominee of our party right now
7781530 a naive boy who transferred to an elite school in order to look for a perfect future bride a fateful encounter with a girl akari came with a blood splash
7781531 with a whistle a massacre started in a classroom its the no 1 devilish love story of this century about a naive boy and bishoujo who has a sword
7781532 i am tempted to believe that ngos connived with the government to make our people stay in camps otherwise how do you explain your failure to inform the world of what was happening in northern uganda for 21 years
7781533 there was a hidden agenda by the government to punish the people of acholi otherwise how can they explain their failure to end the conflict and it dragged for 21 years
7781534 the fallout of the credit crisis will continue to dampen the global economy over the next 24 months with sharply escalated oil and food prices beginning to test inflation expectations
7781535 we recently concentrated on u s and uk primarily because we see value
7781536 the investment environment is expected to remain challenging with expectations of continued pressure on liquidity and possibly subdued trends in the equity markets
7781537 this may impact temaseks ability to divest its stake in various entities and manage its portfolio
7781538 the performance to march 2008 while good is not that surprising since the markets started falling in october and there was a strong rally before that
7781539 the challenge is to perform well in the current year as equity markets have weakened since
7781540 ich fordere russlands f hrung auf seine zusagen einzuhalten und die beiden separatistischen regionen nicht anzuerkennen
7781541 i havent actually been fined by the council so i dont really have to pay anybody
7781542 but im going to punish myself so that people can see i agree that rules are rules
7781543 si nos chiffres de vente taient des bulletins de vote obama gagnerait une majorit crasante tous les jours nous devons r assortir les talages o les gens ont pris des trucs mais nous navons pas besoin de nous occuper de la section mccain parce que personne ny va
7781544 depuis que les gens ont commenc arriver en ville pour la convention nos ventes ont augment de 200
7781545 je ne pensais pas quil allait y avoir autant de monde la seule chose qui sen rapproche ce sont les world series
7781546 cest le premier afro am ricain tre nomm la convention nationale d mocrate cela va tre historique
7781547 she keeps telling everyone daddys paddling for my school so ive got to do it
7781548 stefan is 21 and liam is about 27 so ive roped in the younger guys in case i conk out
7781549 its not a race and safety is paramount so its about the pace and making sure we stay hydrated and have regular food
7781550 ive been told bananas should get us over the first hurdle and chocolate should get us over the next
7781551 my hunch is that we are unlikely to be there because the majority sentiment in the party leadership is that we will be giving mugabe a platform to masquerade as a legitimate president when we dont recognise him as such
7781552 we are also in a difficult position because our national chairman lovemore moyo is now the speaker and we have to decide how to proceed we will have a decision in probably an hour
7781553 i think there was a lot of venting but i dont think that was unnecessarily unhealthy
7781554 the 800 pound gorilla in the room is sustained poor student performance
7781555 ive led as many as 30 personnel in the military at one time
7781556 obviously i cant be the one that was morally and ethically wrong
7781557 when people are out there they are happy they are working with life growing things
7781558 everybody else thought we would only get eight or 10 gardeners the first season
7781559 my goal was 50 from day one sumner has a long gardening history
7781560 everyone was down there in the snow with their boots and umbrellas
7781561 its amazing soil its valley soil the best in the world it should be kept for farming
7781562 my wife said we are having a salad so go down and get some tomatoes
7781563 to forget how to dig the earth and tend the soil is to forget ourselves
7781564 i think its what people expected its going to be a tight race
7781565 her people have to be deeply worried by these returns
7781566 we said all along that we had a lot of work to do and that we werent taking anything for granted
7781567 were still viewing it like that we havent changed our game plan
7781568 the obama wave is also there and were confident that that will have an impact in this state
7781569 for months democrats have tried to say this race wont be close
7781570 the polls have been saying otherwise the primary results just confirmed that its dead even again
7781571 youre going to have a ton of young voters who will come out and vote for obama and no one else on the ticket
7781572 even though nationally it looks like this going to be a very strong democratic year both rossi and mccain seem like theyd be able to overtake those national odds for whatever reason
7781573 that doesnt mean theyll win but both of them are quite competitive in a year when their party has a lot of disadvantages
7781574 what we learned in 2004 is that every vote really does matter
7781575 without the problems and risks associated with starting a network
7781576 project debuting in january both will air over five consecutive weekdays
7781577 there is pressure on my team to do well in the ipl next year because last year we did not get the results we wanted that was in part was down to players coming and going for international duty
7781578 there is a limit with the number of overseas players we can play and a limit to the budget i dont know how much kp pietersen or freddie flintoff will be available next year with the ashes going on thats a big competition for them
7781579 we need players who can play for us for a longer time and gel with the team not coming and going like that
7781580 the decision to make arrests for breach of the peace was based on preventing this group from attending the carnival to commit crime and disorder
7781581 omale v etud kohustusi t itma ning mitte tunnustama separatistlikke piirkondasid
7781582 does it always always have to be about the clintons the clintons are doing everything they can to make this convention all about them and to absolve themselves from the substantive criticism of both clintonism and bill clintons behavior on the campaign
7781583 in what strikes me as an immediate improvement over what might have happened including hours of roll call votes it sounds like clinton and obama have agreed to get her some love while not making the convention drag out forever with calls of im so and so from such and such a state and i feel that x candidate rocks because of this that and the other thing and so yeah im voting for them this will be the true test of the clinton delegates are they really for hillary
7781584 sooo maybe i am not supposed to write this but this convention thing incredibly boring i know obama will light it up thursday night and bill and hillary clinton are must sees joe biden should be interesting but already he is the forgotten man mark warner come on and having to listen to talking heads all day and night ugh
7781585 it doesnt take a political genius to realize that barack obama needed to nominate a woman for vice president
7781586 perhaps had obama picked a more moderate candidate like indianas evan bayh or even virginia gov
7781587 its one of the most significant job losses in australia this year and its obviously going to have a serious impact on the ongoing quality of the companys papers magazines and websites in australia and new zealand
7781588 i never felt scared not even for a moment i took just 10 minutes to settle down
7781589 most of what we call management consists of making it difficult for people to get their work done

7781627 o wabisah are you come to ask what is goodness and what is badness
7781628 goodness is a thing from which your heart finds firmness and rest and badness is a thing which throws you into doubt although men may free you

7781691 its not a little kids sport if you want to call it a little kids sport then so is running or swimming or anything like that any of those sports can be done in the backyard
7781692 we can stay within the sport and we dont have to leave the sport to go to track cycling or road cycling

7781744 acetylsalicylic acid aspirin is based on a plant stress hormone
7781745 i asked myself could there be other plant stress hormones that have clinical efficacy while various studies have suggested that aspirin can prevent cancer especially colon cancer i realized that there could be a chance to find a potent plant hormone that could fight cancer even better i pinpointed jasmonate
7781746 the jasmonate compound is used widely in agriculture and in cosmetics
7781747 proven to be non toxic it has the same regulatory status as table salt that and the fact we are working on a natural chemical gives us a good starting point for launching a new drug

7781754 were letting fire take its natural place in the ecosystem
7781755 the result is going to be a variety of plants and wildlife for the future
7781756 when youre dealing with fire youre depending on weather to either help or hinder you
7781757 the gnats can be bad and this time of year yellow jackets and other stinging insects can be really difficult to deal with
7781758 we have clamped curfew in three places baliguda phulbani and tumudibandh
7781759 the fear is given our track record that the sailing will not be so smooth
7781760 we may return to the hoary days of the past which discredited the political class as a whole and prepared the ground for an extra constitutional intervention
7781761 this is a threat that looms over our heads permanently
7781762 beside a worsening of the economic situation the political instability could encourage the taliban to step up their war on pakistan

7781769 pero en am rica la m sica esta completamente compartimentada y en secciones adulto contempor neo aor disco r amp b estas son falsas divisiones la m sica debe romper barreras yo estaba muy emocionado por ejemplo cuando me enter que joe jackson tocaba en estaciones negras tenemos que lograr la unidad musical as como la unidad pol tica hay un cierto grado de justicia para el xito con war porque cuando vimos a bandas que son clones de u2 alcanzar el xito en los estados unidos est bamos bastante perplejos
7781770 a pesar de que no nos pusieran en la radio pasar tiempo en los estados unidos durante los ltimos tres a os nos ha dado una base y el fundamento que un mont n de otros grupos del tipo de nueva m sica voluble no tienen hay una cierta sensaci n de estabilidad al sentir que no s lo te pintaste la cara de una cierta manera al salir a la calle y eras una prostituta con xito
7781771 war trata sobre la lucha de maneras diferentes emocional f sica pol tica mental incluso luchas en el hogar al igual que la cara del ni o en la portada debes preguntarte
7781772 y de que se esta refugiando un hogar roto cuando hablamos de los refugiados no estamos s lo hablando de asia sudoriental estamos hablando de donde yo vivo todos los d as
7781773 war tambi n tiene que ver con el amor con la violaci n con el suicidio

7781777 it is between michael and the club but in an ideal world we would all like his contract sorted out sooner rather than later
7781778 at the same time though he has got the rest of the season with his current contract
7781779 michael is a world renowned centre forward and a world renowned goalscorer when he leads us out it sends a message to other teams
7781780 it tells them that we have some real quality in our side he is the most world renowned player we have at the club
7781781 if you are playing against michael owen you know you are playing one of the best in the world
7781782 but if a team from the premier league want you you should not doubt yourself
7781783 scouts of fulham have seen me in action with the dutch under 17 team in a tournament in spain
7781784 after the game against czech republic i think fulham have contacted my agent this led to an internship
7781785 the first week i trained at the academy in london then we departed to germany for three friendliy matches that was very nice with four goals and four assists
7781786 im glad that everything is completed before the start of the youth competitions in england
7781787 anton is up this morning for a medical were looking to tie it up today
7781788 i met him last week and it went well he will be a good addition to our squad and it will keep people on their toes
7781789 i will be delighted if i can get him and another one and then we can concentrate on the season
7781790 hes had a slight hamstring strain so it would be unfair to throw him straight in
7781791 there is an international break coming up so it would give him a chance to train with us for two weeks
7781792 donncha oconnor intimated to us yesterday that he would like to appeal the decision whenever a player wants to appeal a decision we stand by our players and help them to fight their case we have always done that in the past and i think it is the same in every county you have to stand by your players
7781793 he has had an x ray and there was no fracture but it looks a nasty one
7781794 i dont know yet how long he will be out but i think he will be missing for some time
7781795 credici perch se non sar io sar qualcun altro ma lamore esiste e credici
7781796 ma nn vero quella ci crede eccome dice cos per dire
7781797 i like the internet because it is very transparent and available to all
7781798 but at the same time there is no authoritave body that can assign some sort of approval rating to truly legitimate works and those spun by unqualified authors
7781799 without the awesome e gaming photographic images studies of steffani ruuska this area would never have reached popular society now we can truly dig out the truths and realities of the e gaming photographic images world around us and develop more reliable and sound conclusions thousands of heads are better than a few
7781800 i first read it online and was turned on that i went out and bought the book now im a true fan of e gaming photographic images studies and research i find the subject to be extremely interesting and thought provoking and reminiscent of the free thought era in the late 60s and early 70s
7781801 the highest usage areas in our library now are the public computers with internet access although most of the time the crowd is younger and usually communicating with friends some older notable e gaming photographic images researchers will come in and go straight for internet completely ignoring the card catalog
7781802 when i published my work it would take a couple years to circulate the academic community and public now with the internet i can write and publish instantly casual readers and researchers alike can review my work as i write it
7781803 im happy to see that young people are interested in our e gaming photographic images studies
7781804 the internet has piqued the interest of our youth and has given them unparalled access to all knowledge academic and secular
7781805 one has to balance artistic talent with the rigors of usable multimedia
7781806 and as a result we tend to only hire those who are from accredited design universitys such as risd
7781807 we love using intense flash graphics for our weekly work
7781808 sie gewann die herzen der menschen doch ihrem eigenen konnte sie nicht folgen
7781809 wie prinzessin diana ihre direkte nachfahrin war georgina sch n glamour s und von der ffentlichkeit bewundert aber w hrend sch nheit und charisma sie zu einem begriff machten den alle welt kannte schien eine sache f r sie ewig unerreichbar die liebe
7781810 ich habe nichts damit zu tun das ist sache der marketingleute ich spielte nur die rolle f r die ich engagiert war und zwar georgina nicht diana
7781811 diana in dem trailer vorkommen zu lassen war nicht meine entscheidung sie m ssen wissen es gibt eine marketingabteilung und es gibt einen film und die beiden sind nicht miteinander liiert nicht die filmemacher sondern die finanziers bestimmen die marketingkampagne
7781812 alles was wir gegen ber dem buch ver ndert haben ist dass der trailer diese verbriefte hnlichkeit anschaulich lebendig macht
7781813 willensstark elegant und mitf hlend sie ist reinstes hollywood von daher ist es kein wunder dass ihr leben endlich verfilmt worden ist
7781814 ber hmtheit verm gen und glamour was k nnte faszinierender sein als die welt der royals diese biografien pr sentieren das leben popul rer k niginnen und prinzessinnen bilder und zitate bringen euch den frauen hinter der krone n her denn je

7781817 seru juga kali ya berciuman sambil nunggu cucian di tempat laundry seperti yang dilakukan ross dan rachel dalam friends
7781818 ih seru gimana itu mah bukan budaya kita kayak enggak ada tempat lain aja
7781819 tapi bahwa hasrat itu bisa muncul kapan saja sekali lagi itu bagian dari insting manusia yang wajar dan alamiah sekali
7781820 kalau menurut saya hasrat seksual adalah hak tiap individu harusnya bukan dilarang dengan undang undang justru batasan moral yang harus lebih diefektifkan
7781821 di tengah budaya masyarakat yang makin permisif public display of affection atau mengumbar kemesraan di tempat umum sepertinya semakin longgar
7781822 orang orang dengan kepribadian ekstrovert atau terbuka akan lebih mudah menerima dan melakukannya
7781823 lo memang kenapa kalau saya melakukannya toh saya tidak mengganggu orang lain
7781824 ini yang membuat masyarakat jadi ambigu di satu pihak mereka bisa menerima hal ini sebagai sebuah pemahaman tapi untuk diri sendiri masih cenderung konservatif
7781825 kalau setuju ya silakan jalan tapi kalau tidak ya jangan lakukan yang penting tidak mengganggu orang lain
7781826 jangan sampai satu pihak merasa puas tapi pihak lain malah tertekan ini juga tidak sehat untuk kelangsungan kehidupan seksual keduanya
7781827 kalau di sini sih orang biasanya masih malu dilihatin seperti itu

7781833 i have never experienced a situation like this being two months without kicking a ball i just want to be fully recovered
7781834 i am not used to being sidelined i feel sad but the worst moment has already gone and i recognise that i must be patient
7781835 i feel well and the time of kicking a ball is coming playing football this is what makes me happy
7781836 het is de bedoeling dat we met 150 fietsjes van start gaan zegt arthur van gaalen
7781837 ik verwacht dat we die laatste fietsen ook wel kwijtraken dus mensen die nog willen meefietsen moeten snel zijn zegt van gaalen die veel zin heeft in de race
7781838 sinds vorige week hebben we een grote pergola van tropisch hardhout met sse keurmerk en twee banken staan zegt jeanette hubbeling voorzitter van stichting de leuningjes
7781839 ik ben echt helemaal blij want het ziet er al prachtig uit en het wordt nog beter want er komen nog twee banken en ook de beplanting komt nog we gaan planten neerzetten die een lekkere geur verspreiden zoals rozen
7781840 bij elke act is een geluidsset nodig en die zijn erg duur zegt gera van dijk van dario fo
7781841 het is voor de operas erg belangrijk dat het geluid goed is
7781842 mensen hebben de afgelopen maanden idee n opgestuurd en verwachten dan dat wij ze uitvoeren
7781843 we gaan de bijdrage vooral gebruiken voor het geluid zegt gera van dijk van dario fo
7781844 bij elke act is een geluidsset nodig en dat is erg duur het is bovendien erg belangrijk dat het geluid goed is
7781845 toen we hoorden van de bijdrage zijn we meteen aan de slag gegaan zegt van dijk
7781846 we gaan voor meer financi le hulp nog wel een beroep doen op enkele andere fondsen
7781847 we weten nu hoe we het moeten doen dus dat scheelt al een hoop een deel van de uitvoeringen zal hetzelfde zijn als in heenweg maar we gaan de cast wel een eigen heuls karakter geven
7781848 we willen ook een bekende opera in een heulse bewerking in het programma opnemen dat zou door drie tenoren gezongen kunnen worden twee seniorenteams van voetbalvereniging quintus die zeven tegen zeven voetbal spelen hebben zich ook al aangemeld om iets te doen
7781849 we hebben er ontzettend veel zin in en zijn hartstikke blij dat het vsb fonds westland ons steunt aldus gera van dijk
7781850 het was in heenweg een groot succes dus waarom zou dat in een ander dorp niet kunnen als heulenaar denk ik dan een beetje chauvinistisch en ik heb geopperd het in kwintsheul te doen
7781851 we gaan niet nog meer operalinten financieren zegt margreet aantjes

7781858 the message youre too close to big oil will trump the message im for drilling off the coast every time
7781859 the oil wing of the republican party is like the mafia or the crips or the bloods once you get in you can never get out
7781860 while the equity markets are currently focused on downside risks we believe there are potential offsets on the upside based on continued strength in commodity demand low inventory levels and a supply side which continues to face multiple constraints
7781861 the group continues to perform strongly and the outlook remains positive
7781862 the headline profit number is certainly well ahead of expectations and the commentary associated with numbers appears very positive at this point in time
7781863 rios exposure to the bulk commodities sector has been extremely beneficial for the company and i think that the results will be very positively received by the market
7781864 the groups performance in the first half together with our growth potential supports the boards view that rio tinto presents a very strong standalone for shareholders
7781865 although we have seen some moderation in global growth rates from tightened availability of credit the impact on our markets has been modest
7781866 i think overall the trend of the market is bearish right now but the hurricane premium as well as the russia nato premium is whats keeping the market from dropping further

7781869 they would be as successful today as they were in their own era because of their ability to adapt not only to their audiences but to the era they were playing in
7781870 they had a very unique ability to integrate themselves into any audience demographic
7781871 it really helps from on high to have somebody that you revere that you care about and want to hear what theyre saying and doing and what theyre wearing everything
7781872 thats important for us whether its an apparition or not
7781873 people are looking back now because were in a very similar situation to 68 an unpopular war an unpopular president whos waging it serious domestic problems
7781874 people ached to feel noble in 1968 and they ache to feel noble again
7781875 people sense theres a similarity between the two periods and it makes the kennedys more interesting to them
7781876 i dont think the american people know them very well
7781877 they do a lot of good humanitarian work but if i was to have to name them i think i would have a hard time
7781878 it is time again for a new generation of leadership it is time now for barack obama
7781879 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
7781880 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7781881 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
7781882 their big challenge is convincing people that they will continue to be active in politics and theyre going to continue to have a voice
7781883 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
7781884 an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections and was seeking to redeem himself to those closest to him yes that is who i supported
7781885 she knew she should not have participated in him running for president with this bomb waiting to go off she did she kinda loses my sympathy
7781886 i believe we are all owed a huge apology not self serving claims for pity by both john and elizabeth edwards who both knew about the affair and both decided to go forward and seek the democratic candidacy regardless of the titanic risk
7781887 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
7781888 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
7781889 i thought it was very naive on both their parts
7781890 it would be very sad if he were the nominee of our party right now
7781891 social networking sites can help your organization increase awareness about an issue find signatures for a petition and encourage supporters to take action moreover by building up a network of contacts on a social networking site nonprofits can leverage the tools viral abilities to quickly spread messages and alerts to a wide audience beyond their immediate community of supporters yet when it comes to social networking is more always better as should your organization use social networking sites points out these tools arent for every organization yet if youve determined that your nonprofit would benefit from having a presence on one social networking site would you find even more success on two or more sites if so how should you go about choosing these sites
7781892 when you do shop at the grocery store its very limited they dont have a very wide selection
7781893 i think if we had a farmers market i think we would shop more and eat more produce
7781894 were already outpacing 2007 so i think were going to see significant growth
7781895 it helps the local farmer it helps the families both stretch their food dollars and makes sure they are getting access to fruits and vegetables
7781896 how cool would it be to be driving a car powered by carp
7781897 its hard to see a fish wasted when there are people in the world that are starving and could use the food
7781898 itd be great if we could find a market for these fish and that market could fund the whole effort

7781918 this deception is a common practice if not the exclusive method of presenting sda dogma to the unsuspecting public at least the jw and mormon have the intestinal fortitude to identify themselves up front when they promote their cultic beliefs
7781919 initially a lot of people told me it might be a bad idea to hold the meetings in such a small venue
7781920 i wasnt concerned at all because while there are those who attend locally the majority of the participants are those who watch worldwide
7781921 theres nothing i love more than going home to edinburgh but i havent lived in scotland for nine years

7781946 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
7781947 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
7781948 since women having abortions can no longer be said to have a low risk of suffering from psychiatric conditions such as depression doctors have a duty to advise about long term adverse psychological consequences of abortion
7781949 we now know that abortion leads to depression and mental health problems in later life along with other complications in future pregnancies
7781950 abortion research is highly politicised but large high quality studies consistently show that having an abortion does not result in psychological damage
7781951 i think if ordinary everyday americans understood that we are sacrificing the lives of our sons and daughters to get somebody elses oil to drive energy inefficient vehicles that pollute the atmosphere that would dramatize it a lot more
7781952 i would hope that leaders in our country would let people know that we are in fact trading the lives of young people for a corrupt energy policy
7781953 foreign policy climate and environment and energy policy and military policy all arrive at the same place and thats the persian gulf
7781954 the old days of saying now were going to talk about the environment and after that well talk about energy and after that well talk about foreign policy and after that well talk about national security those days are over they all are inextricably intertwined

7781958 im a big believer that to get the american people to agree on transformative change youve got to show bipartisan support
7781959 and i think if were really going to get the change in the energy field its going to take that
7781960 hey no weve had sound bites before look at this comprehensive approach where everything is on the table were going to do whats in this countrys long term interest

7781983 i asked myself could there be other plant stress hormones that have clinical efficacy while various studies have suggested that aspirin can prevent cancer especially colon cancer i realized that there could be a chance to find a potent plant hormone that could fight cancer even better i pinpointed jasmonate

7782004 find two trees the right distance apart and connect them by poles laid upon the forks of each at a height of about eight feet this forms the support of your lean to against this horizontal bar place small poles close together driving their ends in the ground and forming an angle with about the slant of an ordinary roof you can close in both sides or not as you choose if you leave one open build your fire opposite the entrance thus making a cheerful and airy open face camp thatch from the ground up with overlapping rows of flat and thick evergreen boughs and spread several layers of the same for a springy and fragrant bed
7782005 the dome shaped wigwam or wickiup is made in a few minutes almost anywhere by sticking into the ground in a circle a sufficient number of limber poles such as willow wands to make it the size you need each pair of opposites is bent forward until they meet and the ends interlocked and tied firmly use any convenient material for the covering an extra blanket will do
7782006 the skeleton of the conical teepee is made by tying three poles together near the top and when raised separating them to form a tripod against this place in a circle as many poles as you think necessary to support your outer covering of cloth or thatch usually twelve to fifteen if of canvas the covering is tied to a pole and then raised and wrapped about the framework and secured with wooden pins to within about three feet of the ground this space is left for the entrance and covered by a movable door which may be merely a small blanket if you have nothing better a quantity of dry grass will make you a warm bed
7782007 it is best in camping to build small fires this rule is observed by all indians smoke may be seen at a great distance especially on a clear day and may be scented by the ordinary indian or other person a long way off if the wind is right only in cold weather or for special purposes does the indian indulge in a huge fire and in no case does he ever leave it without seeing that it is entirely extinguished
7782008 you taught me how to hit the ball when we played t ball and i was a very good thrower
7782009 he needs to play i didnt think he was sharp early in the week in practice because he hadnt been out there he wasnt at the same speed as the other guys as the week went on his speed picked up and i thought he played fast tonight
7782010 it was nice to get out there in a little live environment
7782011 preseason is a great time to fine tune some things everything was smooth tonight
7782012 i was glad he got to play and get out there before we go crank it up for real
7782013 i would hate for him to have his first catch in the first game of the regular season it was good to get him out there
7782014 he got rolled up on late obviously they called a penalty on it but hes okay
7782015 im glad it happened now but there are some things you take for granted when you have a new center
7782016 obviously if you run for close to 90 yards in a half the offensive line has got to be doing something good
7782017 he wasnt active very many games last year but every time weve called on him this training camp and in games hes made plays he brings a dimension he brought to this team two years ago and its exciting for me to see him playing the way he is hes going to be a part of what we do
7782018 weve got a good group of receivers but there are things were going to ask him to do
7782019 hes improved a great deal as a special teams player if you can play on special teams and then you can make plays in the passing game your chances of getting a lot of action go up

7782034 dominasi yang dilakukan ritel terhadap para pemasok membuat sentimen negatif terhadap pasokan yang diberikan para pemasok kepada sektor pasar tradisional
7782035 pemasok akan lebih memilih menjual barangnya kepada ritel modern ketimbang pasar tradisional sehingga pasar tradisional tidak bisa berkembang
7782036 padahal sektor pasar tradisional sangat bagus untuk memajukan para pemasok baru yang masih merintis

7782041 alex comfort was writing in an age when free love was the fashion fidelity is seen as much more important nowadays we understand how hurtful sleeping around can be on relationships so i removed or toned down the things that wouldnt be acceptable
7782042 nowadays we also realise the harm prostitution does we didnt think it had anything to do with loving relationships
7782043 the whole technology side of things is important people are meeting online and even having relationships over the internet i also emphasized sex toys more dr comfort had one section called gadgets and gimmicks i have expanded that into around ten sections

7782049 animal communication has been a major emphasis in animal behaviour and comparative psychology for many decades
7782050 however in recent years we have gone beyond the straightforward analysis of dyadic interactions between two individuals we now consider the role of eavesdropping deception and noisy environments in shaping signals and investigate how animals deploy them in various contexts

7782053 during everyday life we constantly evaluate social behaviour and this largely affects how we feel about ourselves and other people but the way we store and use information about our own and other peoples social behaviour are not well understood

7782055 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
7782056 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
7782057 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
7782058 by translating these basic cognitive neuroscience insights into clinical research we now have the potential to discover new key functional anatomical characteristics of the brain that may lie behind depressive disorders
7782059 the results will hopefully make an important contribution to our understanding of the causes of depression that will ultimately allow new approaches to find better treatments and prevention

7782083 so cutting our energy costs not only helps the environment but has a remarkable effect on the final cost of our products improving our overall plant efficiency
7782084 our presses were one of the most energy consuming activities and all had different cycle times and clamping forces ranging from 50 to 2 300 tons
7782085 several of the presses were also not very modern so although they worked perfectly well they were not energy efficient
7782086 each press had one or two motors and for each an acs550 drive was installed
7782087 this required a total downtime of 1 5 days and the daily production lines were not affected on top of this no operators needed any specific training as it did not affect their tasks
7782088 the payback time of the entire investment was only 16 months and the work environment has improved due to noise reduction because the pumps dont have to work at maximum speed

7782127 if surgery is advised researching the best possible doctor and hospital for the child is essential
7782128 parents have many questions about the surgical procedure and almost always they first ask me where can i find a child surgeon
7782129 the more knowledgeable parents are about their childs condition the better they will be able to manage his or her care
7782130 regardless of the surgeons opinion if parents feel uncertain they should not hesitate to ask questions for further clarification
7782131 once the parents have developed confidence with the medical team and facility their child will sense their level of comfort
7782132 the parents will be able to express their support and love much more comfortably because their minds will not be preoccupied with as much uncertainty
7782133 parents ask me all the time how do i prepare my child for surgery
7782134 once they have identified the surgeon and the medical facility where the surgery will take place preparations for the procedure will begin

7782239 he is a true statesman who will always put the country first
7782240 with obama we have words with mccain we have deeds with obama we have rhetoric with mccain we have a record
7782241 during the primary i was a huge supporter of hillary clinton
7782242 they were willing to throw women completely under the bus i just couldnt believe the treatment that hillary clinton got
7782243 there may be a few outliers but overall there is going to be tremendous unity and hillary is going to be leading the charge
7782244 it makes me sad that mccain is using it against us
7782245 it may unite our party against the outsider what he said was the truth but it may unite us against him
7782246 john mccain is trying to make political hay out of an internal dispute
7782247 i doubt we can win this year with just galvanizing the conservative base though that is important
7782248 there are states he could help in i suppose he is a feisty speaker who can go on the attack thats the main reason he was picked i suspected
7782249 it does not make a lot of sense the gop should look to the future
7782250 i think most politically educated people understand that it was not giuliani that blew up but his stupid strategy
7782251 his campaign was all about the world trade center and the protection of america
7782252 obviously the gop understands the need to appeal to as broad a base as possible but they cant just have window dressing as they did in 2004
7782253 they have to live up to what their moderate speakers say
7782254 rudy giuliani brings the message republicans want to bring the gop is about national security
7782255 he will bring back the issue of the war on terror thats what he will talk about rudy giuliani will not try to remake the platform i dont believe he will get up and speak about abortion
7782256 in the broad sense the earths climate is determined by solar radiation
7782257 there is now little doubt that solar wind variability streams of ionized gases that radiate out from the sun is the primary cause of climate change on a decadal time scale
7782258 we are not concerned about hundreds of thousands of years or millennia we are concerned about decades in the study because we are interested in what fits the human life span
7782259 it looks as if solar activity not solar radiation itself determines what happens with the climate
7782260 by disregarding or ignoring the very much larger changes of solar ultraviolet or of the solar wind and its magnetic field effect on cosmic rays and thus on cloud coverage the ipcc has managed to trivialize the climate effects of solar variability
7782261 anything that falls beyond the purview of anthropogenic human caused global warming is not going to be seriously investigated by the ipcc
7782262 thats why the ipcc should never be viewed as a scientific manual it was created for the sole purpose of supporting the notion of human induced climate change
7782263 although the rarity of the current episode of high average sunspot numbers may indicate that the sun has contributed to the unusual climate change during the twentieth century we point out that solar variability is unlikely to have been the dominant cause of the strong warming during the past three decades
7782264 whats controversial in my view is not the fact that solar activity affects the climate but the exact mechanism the details
7782265 theres overwhelming evidence its also in my report that solar activity varying on a time scale of decades produces corresponding affects on the climate on decadal scale

7782298 kerry made good progress in the first half of 2008 delivering 7 3 per cent like for like revenue growth while maintaining trading margins despite significant currency and input cost pressures
7782299 building on the groups performance in the half year and the underlying prospects for our business in all regions we expect a good outturn for 2008 and reconfirm our expectation to grow earnings for the full year to a range of 151 cent to 155 cent per share
7782300 given recent adverse economic news we judge this a reassuring set of results
7782301 there is evidence that higher raw material and energy costs have been passed on to consumers
7782302 wanton disregard of the good name of their area never mind the safety of people passing
7782303 it is very disappointing that we had a number of young people gathered last night who started to thrown stones and other missiles at passing vehicles some of which contained families and young children
7782304 it is just unacceptable and very very regrettable that what was a small number of young people have caused this damage
7782305 wie haben ihnen in valencia strecke und das drumherum gefallen
7782306 als erstes muss man erw hnen dass das eine tolle leistung war der event ging ohne jeglichen vorfall ber die b hne daf r kann man valencia gratulieren nat rlich kann man im paddock noch etwas mehr atmosph re schaffen aber das k nnen wir in den kommenden jahren entwickeln
7782307 lewis war als er am samstagmorgen aufstand nicht in seiner besten form er hat einen fantastischen job gemacht denn er wurde im tagesverlauf besser und st rker die jungen piloten sind aus einem besonderen holz geschnitzt und er hat bald wieder normalform erreicht
7782308 bestand die sorge dass er im rennen nicht fahren k nnen w rde
7782309 nein wir machten uns sorgen dar ber wie er im tagesverlauf zu recht kommen wird aber er ist gut zurecht gekommen
7782310 wann waren sie sicher dass er fahren k nnen wird
7782311 zumindest eine viertelstunde vor dem beginn des dritten freien trainings er ging erst 15 minuten nach trainingsbeginn auf die strecke aber wir wollten sicherstellen dass er gen gend vorbereitungszeit hatte
7782312 es ist eng zwischen felipe und lewis und es ist eng zwischen heikki und kimi
7782313 was haben sie auf der performance ihres autos gegen ber ferrari gelernt
7782314 dieses ist kein wirklich technischer kurs ich denke es ist eng es ist eng zwischen felipe und lewis und es ist eng zwischen heikki und kimi ich pers nlich w rde daraus nichts entscheidendes interpretieren f r uns ist es die beste philosophie zu sagen dass wir zur ck liegen und das auto bis zum n chsten rennen schneller machen
7782315 lewis hatte ein ruhiges rennen was wir schon eine weile nicht behaupten konnten es war eine solide vorstellung ist dieses die langfristige strategie um die weltmeisterschaft zu gewinnen und nicht unbedingt jedes einzelne rennen
7782316 gegen rennende haben wir den motor gedrosselt denn wir wollten eine solide punkteperformance angesichts dessen das lewis am samstag nicht in bestform war hat er alles getan was von ihm verlangt wurde und das hat er auch am sonntag gemacht kein risiko punkte sammeln und die f hrung in der weltmeisterschaft ausbauen
7782317 wir alle lernen lewis lernt er wird mental st rker er befand sich bereits in einem wm kampf und steckt nun im n chsten ich bin mir sicher dass er wieder etwas lernen wird genauso wie er es das letzte mal getan hat
7782318 ist das ein spezielles strategiethema um punkte zu fahren und ein solides rennen zu zeigen
7782319 in wirklichkeit sollte sich das team dieses nicht an seine fahnen heften lewis ist ein intelligenter fahrer er will jedes rennen und jede session gewinnen aber ich denke dass er entspannter und zuversichtlicher in seiner einstellung wird er realisiert dass der gewinn der weltmeisterschaft am ende des jahres das wirklich wichtige ist
7782320 ich bezweifle ob wir uns im kommenden rennen auf einen motorenplatzer verlassen sollten
7782321 angenommen sie w ren in der ferrari position und w rden zwei motorensch den haben w hrend das reglement eingefroren ist ist es schwer etwas am innenleben zu ver ndern
7782322 ja wenn es ein bewiesenes zuverl ssigkeitsproblem ist und sie sich darum k mmern m ssen f r massa ist die realit t dass er seinen motor im n chsten rennen fahren muss dass mag sie beunruhigen ich wei es nicht das war eine berlegung als wir beschlossen haben unseren motor zu drosseln wir waren am ende unseres motoreneinsatzes aber wir wollten umsichtig handeln damit lewis zu ende f hrt
7782323 eine andere berlegung w re es vielleicht gewesen dass wir genau das nicht tun sollten vielleicht h tten wir gas geben sollen denn wir wissen ja dass massas motor bis spa halten muss aber wir haben uns zu einer umsichtigen aktion entschlossen wer wei vielleicht berlebt das triebwerk das n chste rennen vielleicht auch nicht aber ich bezweifle ob wir uns im kommenden rennen auf einen motorenplatzer verlassen sollten
7782324 ist es komisch dass nach zehn rennen ohne probleme bei ferrari pl tzlich zweimal in folge ein motor kaputt geht
7782325 nein die toleranzen in den motoren sind winzig und alles wird extrem belastet ich kann mich erinnern dass auch wir probleme hatten ferrari ist ein professionelles team und sie werden das in den griff bekommen sie hatten in der vergangenheit eine tolle zuverl ssigkeit und daher glaube ich nicht dass wir im wm kampf darauf z hlen k nnen dass sie zuverl ssigkeitsprobleme haben werden wir m ssen sie auf der strecke schlagen
7782326 er ist sicherlich ein anw rter er hat die erwartungen vieler leute in sachen zuverl ssigkeit bertroffen nat rlich kennen wir kimi besser er ist ein guter wettbewerber und wird sicher nachdenken aber das war kein wirklich technischer kurs man muss gut auf den bremsen sein und kimi wird in spa zur ckschlagen
7782327 es war zu erwarten dass die leipziger messe mit ihrer terminank ndigung den versuch unternimmt das thema auch 2009 im programm zu halten sie werden dies dann aber weitgehend ohne die branche tun m ssen die leitmesse findet 2009 und dar ber hinaus in k ln statt
7782328 wir bringen aus leipzig die klare botschaft mit dass die games industrie 2009 auf der gamescom in k ln ausstellen wird wir sind auf breite zustimmung gesto en die branche freut sich auf k ln was immer in deutschland 2009 au erhalb k lns stattfindet kann keinen anspruch erheben diese branche zu repr sentieren

7782335 he had a couple outings where he struggled but to come back against these guys is pretty good
7782336 its tough to walk away with a loss but overall i was happy with the outing

7782339 the mhra is aware of the issue any regulatory action that may be necessary to minimise harm to patients will be taken once the new information has been carefully reviewed
7782340 based on the information presented by the study investigator and the analyses conducted independently by the university of oxford clinical trial service unit and epidemiological studies unit msp believes the cancer finding is likely to be an anomaly that taken in the light of all the available data does not support an association with vytorin also known as inegy
7782341 we are committed to working with regulatory agencies to further evaluate the available data and interpretations of those data we do not believe that changes in the clinical use of vytorin are warranted
7782342 wer ganz nach oben will muss viel zeit und engagement investieren

7782345 politik muss rahmenbedingungen f r finanzm rkte vorgeben nicht umgekehrt
7782346 crash statt cash warum wir die globalen finanzm rkte b ndigen m ssen
7782347 demokratische politik muss die rahmenbedingung f r die finanzm rkte vorgeben nicht umgekehrt die finanzm rkte m ssen die realwirtschaft unterst tzen anstatt sie zu dominieren und zu destabilisieren
7782348 globalisierte finanzm rkte brauchen globale politische regulierung die bisherigen vorschl ge zur reform der finanzm rkte sind scheinheilig und v llig unzureichend anstatt das system grundlegend zu ver ndern zielen sie auf schadensbegrenzung ab dies liegt vor allem im interesse von gro en finanzinstituten konzernen und verm genden die kurzfristige jagd nach hohen renditen geht so weiterhin auf kosten der allgemeinheit
7782349 ihre trockenlegung w re einfacher als angenommen weil es sich zumeist um protektorate der industrienationen handelt und sie vom freien kapitalverkehr abh ngig sind
7782350 die immer absurderen ausw chse an gewinnstreben und undurchschaubaren hochriskanten finanzinstrumenten haben keinen volkswirtschaftlichen nutzen
7782351 daher muss es eine genehmigungspflicht f r derivate und eine beschr nkung von hochrendite fonds geben
7782352 mit der immer gr er werdenden konzentration von verm gen str mt immer mehr geld mit berh hten renditeerwartungen auf die finanzm rkte
7782353 eine politik f r eine global gerechte verteilung des reichtums w rde daher auch f r stabilit t auf den finanzm rkten sorgen
7782354 die derzeitige instabilit t auf den finanzm rkten verursacht armut sozialabbau umweltzerst rung lohndumping und arbeitslosigkeit die politik ist durch die deregulierung der letzten jahrzehnte daf r verantwortlich sie hat es in der hand die spielregeln zu ndern mit dem buch leistet attac einen wichtigen beitrag zu einer dringend erforderlichen breiten ffentlichen diskussion es wird auch auf den ffentlichen druck von uns allen ankommen ob ein wirklicher systemwechsel erreicht werden kann
7782355 knapp die h lfte der am point of sale mit unserem internetbasierten kalkulations und abwicklungstool lukas erstellten vertr ge sind inzwischen kreditantr ge dass wir weit mehr als nur leasing anbieten wird also nicht nur registriert sondern auch stark nachgefragt
7782356 damit gingen rund 65 prozent unseres im inland erzielten neugesch fts auf das konto des finanzverbunds eine beachtliche leistung
7782357 im finanzverbund sind wir der ausgewiesene finanzierungsspezialist f r kleine und mittelst ndische unternehmen dank unserer stark vertriebsorientierten prozesse tools wie vr leasyonline oder auch dem kreditpr fungsverfahren einfach und schnell k nnen wir uns mittlerweile mit fug und recht als deutschlands schnellste leasinggesellschaft bezeichnen
7782358 wir haben dem russischen markt in den vergangenen jahren sehr viel aufmerksamkeit geschenkt dies zahlt sich jetzt aus aufgrund unseres gesch ftserfolgs dort haben wir mit st petersburg gerade einen neuen standort ge ffnet und mit nowgorod krasnodar novosibirsk und ekaterinenburg kommen demn chst vier weitere hinzu
7782359 kameras mit noch h herer pixelzahl bieten keine bessere bildqualit t
7782360 stattdessen brauchen die fotos mehr speicherplatz was die bearbeitung am pc verlangsamt
7782361 der stromverbrauch ist nur bei manchen modellen in der beschreibung angegeben
7782362 deshalb sollte man unmittelbar nach dem kauf testen wie viele aufnahmen m glich sind notfalls kann man die kamera dann umtauschen

7782369 natural forests in muduuma are finished forests are now being replaced by eucalyptus trees and gardens
7782370 the district cannot suspend our operations since we work under an act of parliament
7782371 nfa only gave away areas that were greatly degraded in order to replace the damaged parts but currently all permits were recalled to review the process
7782372 it just came with his nature he was always for helping people do better
7782373 so many of the times i called him to seek his advice had to do with personnel issues he was so good with that his counsel was always to be kind to people and treat them the way you wanted to be treated
7782374 some may be able to offer longer hours on four days of the week and potentially improve the access to patients

7782377 barbara cartland ist eine der erfolgreichsten liebesroman autorinnen der welt bereits 2007 haben wir f r unsere leserinnen einen sehr erfolgreichen sonderband zusammengestellt seit dem erreichten uns immer wieder anfragen ob wir einen neuen sonderband mit barbara cartland auflegen w rden
7782378 i knew it wasnt an engine problem there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold
7782379 the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping my highest priority was to get a mask on to my son who was sitting next to me in a bemused and frightened state
7782380 we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft as we landed we saw fire engines every quarter of a mile down the runway
7782381 it was obvious to me that there was depressurisation in the cabin but there was no announcement and no evidence of the cabin crew for most of this experience why on earth didnt they give a few more calming words to the passengers
7782382 wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons
7782383 he was hyperventilating i looked at the lady on my left and hers hadnt filled up either from where i was sitting i could see about 20 masks and only a few of them were inflating it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
7782384 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
7782385 we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew also deploy their oxygen masks
7782386 they cant be making passenger pa announcements when they have their oxygen masks on as the passengers confirmed the pilot did make an announcement once he got down to 8 000ft where it is safe to take the oxygen masks off that they were diverting to limoges
7782387 i would say some people thought we were going to die that is how frightening it was
7782388 ryanairs engineers have inspected the aircraft overnight and have confirmed that the oxygen masks which deployed were working properly
7782389 they cant be making passenger pa announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
7782390 were losing our culture were losing our natural resources and were losing our health
7782391 so were kind of on a train thats going over a cliff and we just have to stop get out and find another way
7782392 the majority of americans are not in a position to engage in fine dining on a regular basis
7782393 very little substantive change has come to our poorest neighborhoods
7782394 i realized chez panisse has always been a slow food restaurant
7782395 i think that good pure affordable wholesome food should be available to everybody
7782396 and it should be a right and not a privilege
7782397 no sooner did we get the green revolution no sooner did the specter of mass starvation get pushed aside than we got this organic nonsense
7782398 i get a basic disdain for america and the american way of doing things from slow food
7782399 were building a stage on which a lot of organizations could bring their message and their hope for a more sustainable and more just food system

7782413 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7782414 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
7782415 speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
7782416 is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
7782417 there were no injuries and minimal damage to the vehicle
7782418 we are coordinating with pakistani authorities in investigating the incident
7782419 the issue of poverty has replaced gay marriage as a galvanizing issue for christians
7782420 i would say the issue of poverty has replaced gay marriage as a galvanizing issue for christians
7782421 now the religious issues include climate change darfur and the war in iraq
7782422 the new generation will no longer be in the political pocket of any party theyre not going to be delivered to anybody
7782423 a lot of evangelicals are leaving the religious right and the republican party in droves theyre going to go with who speaks to their issues
7782424 i would not say there is an organized religious left like the christian coalition
7782425 savvy marketing and public relations theyve done a very good job of marketing themselves but the moral majority is certainly not the majority
7782426 the religious right was meeting a dynamic spiritual hunger in a lot of people a hunger for values a spiritual connection with the sublime
7782427 the left abandoned that and the right was able to meet that hunger
7782428 often the religious debate has been around a few divisive issues and we feel that doesnt represent the values held in common by people of faith poverty immigration reform human rights economic issues
7782429 the monologue of the religious right is over and a new dialogue has now begun and thats a good thing for churches and for politics theres been a sea change in the agenda of christians and evangelicals youll see it played out in both conventions and the elections this fall
7782430 i see more momentum now than i have in three decades of working on this problem

7782436 john mccain is going to be a tougher opponent for obama than anyone could have guessed a few weeks ago
7782437 he is able to tell a very powerful story that is really emotionally connected to his audience
7782438 america saw this as a debate without squabbling they talked about religion and values without bitterness and accusations
7782439 these are the kinds of forums we need i want people to know me well im sure john mccain feels the same way if we are known i trust in the american people to make a good decision
7782440 there was so much blood it looked like a murder scene

7782480 in all honesty father your wife and daughters have been socially acceptable for many years
7782481 with the local farmers do you think them to be acquaintances worthy of me
7782482 i do believe our circle of friends are more than just farmers
7782483 well father you make the opinion that we do not venture into the correct society
7782484 do you wish us to dine with nobility shall i send them our card
7782485 i will rise to dine in their exalted ranks eventually and if i cant do it by marrying you lot into their lines then ill find some other way
7782486 we are only second generation trade do you really expect a lord or an earl will come here and choose one of us
7782487 no not yet although many nobles have little money they will marry beneath them from time to time to gain wealth once more
7782488 we have no fear on that account sir weve little compared to most
7782489 all this requires a great deal of money position and status requires even more i have money and with it i intend to buy power and eminence
7782490 what did you wish to speak to me about father
7782491 i had a meeting today with reginald ellsworth he has some business interests equaling mine in fact i own a profitable venture he wishes to take off my hands
7782492 i am giving him a good price and in return he affords me the opportunity to marry one of you into his pedigree of course your marriage settlements from your mothers money has greased the way a little
7782493 ellsworth has granted a union between you heather and his eldest son andrew i believe you may expect a call from andrew tomorrow
7782494 well heather and andrew have only begun a friendship to speak of marriage to cement a business deal is unjust
7782495 i had hoped our family would be different we have seen the evidence of a marriage made solely for business reasons
7782496 but there has been no romantic involvement yet father has there heather
7782497 this has nothing to do with romantic notions you silly fool

7782515 the government of afghanistan has repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7782516 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids

7782522 if i slept there they just woke me up and i delivered the baby i had a skipping rope and running shoes at the hospital so i would skip rope have breakfast and go to the operating room to do hysterectomies this went on for years and years
7782523 at times it was frustrating but then you knew if it was you that he would be there for you
7782524 he gave you so much time he was a big schmoozer
7782525 i had an attitude that if i dont deliver the baby the patient will be upset
7782526 the fact that people can be stopped at international airports around the country should be a warning to everyone that the court will take a tough approach with people who have outstanding fines

7782575 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7782576 an open time limit is not acceptable in any security deal that governs the presence of the international forces
7782577 go through a number of levers in the iraqi political system before we actually have an agreement from the iraqi side
7782578 i think its no secret and i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think that settlement activity is helpful
7782579 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7782580 i think its no secret and i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think that settlement activity is helpful
7782581 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided

7782587 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
7782588 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
7782589 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7782590 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7782591 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7782592 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7782593 no one works for someone we all just work together
7782594 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7782595 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
7782596 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7782597 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7782598 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7782599 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7782600 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7782601 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7782602 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7782603 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7782604 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7782605 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7782606 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7782607 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7782608 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7782609 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7782610 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7782611 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7782612 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7782613 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7782614 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7782615 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7782616 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7782617 stand firm against the war in iraq iran and afghanistan i conclude then go out a register large number of new young voters and get them to the polls but with your own groups politicians pay attention to organized voters i do several more radio tv and press interviews throughout the day
7782618 almost every delegate i met was completely against the war reported one they return in batches in high spirits although everyone wishes they had greater numbers

7782629 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7782630 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7782631 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7782632 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7782633 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7782634 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7782635 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7782636 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7782637 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7782638 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7782639 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7782640 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7782641 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7782642 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7782643 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7782644 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7782645 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7782646 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7782647 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7782648 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7782649 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7782650 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7782651 this is a planning took where all things are going
7782652 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7782653 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7782654 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7782655 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7782656 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7782657 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7782658 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7782659 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7782660 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7782661 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7782662 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7782663 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7782664 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7782665 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7782666 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7782667 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7782668 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7782669 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7782670 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7782671 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7782672 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7782673 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7782674 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7782675 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes

7782677 music industry conferences in canada will yield less because showcases will be unattended by foreign music buyers agents label representatives and radio programmers whose travel and accommodation expenses were partly paid by these federal funds
7782678 and fewer canadian acts will be able to take part in showcases in major foreign talent conferences hundreds of small businesses in the canadian arts sector representing millions of dollars in cultural revenue will be affected
7782679 the value of contracts directly negotiated as a result of ecmas federal fund supported international program during the four day ecma conferences in 2006 and 2007 is 1 1 million
7782680 that doesnt include incremental revenue from tours and record sales
7782681 im doing a six week tour of australia in december these are opportunities i would never have had without the federal funding programs
7782682 foreign buyers are looking for the next big thing in canada at cmw we present 500 canadian acts in dozens of showcases and five or six are picked up every year by foreign labels agents and managers
7782683 the number of international buyers increased by 39 per cent over 2007
7782684 a huge rung is missing in the ladder of success because of these funding cuts
7782685 will severely affect our ability to create and train artists and industry professionals to work on a global scale also the addition of top international music buyers raises the bar of any event attracting more top artists and professionals the past has taught us that if you dismantle the cultural railroad it may become impossible to rebuild
7782686 last year 21 canadian companies with financial assistance from promart the ontario government and the canadian consulate went to a music trade mission in tokyo
7782687 toronto singer songwriter justin nozuka was a guest of the canadian consulate in los angeles during grammy week and as a result ended up playing the fuji pop festival in japan and securing a label deal there every company has a story like that
7782688 walk nice and tall stretch out the spine remember we dance for an audience and not just for ourselves
7782689 for me more than anything else its finding the kids for whom its quite invigorating and inspiring to be asked to do something repeatedly i love that over the summer you can see them really catching on to the fact that theyre increasing their ability day by day
7782690 there are some kids whose eyes sparkle and you can see that for them this is like brain candy
7782691 often around the age of 14 and 15 and then again around 17
7782692 we find them doing a lot of soul searching about whether this really is the profession that they want
7782693 getting a sense of their motivation for dance some are not dancing for themselves theyre dancing for someone else
7782694 most of the time thats a family issue and not a kid issue
7782695 you can see over the month how their passion for ballet escalates
7782696 you may be the best student in your school at home and then you get in a class with other boys and you see how they are jumping and you push yourself
7782697 if its not the right time lets honour the childs sense of purpose

7782699 niet iedereen begrijpt mij maar ik denk dat ik de juiste keuze gemaakt heb
7782700 it is not their religion it is their poverty that drives them to such actions
7782701 salafi jihaadi has a blog that features images of al qaida leaders osama bin laden and abu musab al zarqawi british jihadist abu hamza and the 19 hijackers who carried out the sept
7782702 with over 173 people listed ali appears to be part of a wide network of people who share similar sentiments
7782703 remember we are the next generation of muslims and its an obligation and responsibility of each and every muslim to implement as allah commanded
7782704 to college to become a cop hopefully work my way up as a detective
7782705 as a martyr if not that way then while im praying and my heads on the floor
7782706 defending something either my family my religion or my country basically i wanna die a martyr
7782707 as a martyr for god or in a huge nuclear explosion
7782708 is one of these 70young people who openly aspire to be a martyr in the name of allah one of the next wave of terrorists who will attack america
7782709 artists raise their kids differently we have art around the house we have books we go to plays we talk our focus is art and painting and dress up and singing its what we love so i think you can see how artists in some way raise other artists
7782710 brad and angelina dont give a f k what the world thinks of how theyre raising their kids
7782711 they live like people in simi valley only with more zeros on the price of the home
7782712 dan rij je langs akkers met gladiolen denk je ik wist niet dat die hier werden geteeld dacht dat alleen bij ens gebeurde

7782715 were monitoring the track of gustav and reviewing our destructive weather plans and procedures
7782716 a critique on our culture and how it has progressed in its evolution specifically with technology and nature
7782717 to connect the idea of technology in the cell and technology in our outer larger macroscopic world comparing and contrasting the two
7782718 ive got that archaeology thing going on in the back of my mind
7782719 these original art forms clay metal these materials found in our environment have progressed to allow us to have computers and tvs and telephones theyre all made of metal essentially and you need copper wires and steel wires to transmit information
7782720 the biological cell is this fundamental building block that i believe works like a machine it is the most efficient machine possible it creates human beings
7782721 im going to put a circuit board in as the nucleus because thats what a nucleus is it runs the show its a play on the question of are we machines do we really run ourselves or is someone else controlling us
7782722 pretty much spent the next two weeks hiding out in herzliya
7782723 i look at the news and i get really upset the process of making art helps me to deal with that but im very grateful that other people get lots of different things out of it one of my friends says you always make ovum thats all you do i guess thats right i do im a woman artist and a lot of people see sea creatures i dont know if thats subconsciously because im a pisces but im just glad that they like it
7782724 those two types of cells are related to sense and instinct and processing information
7782725 yes i know that feeling yes i know that one too
7782726 can i get you a glass of wine or something
7782727 i dont know the ethnicity of my blood parents but as far as i am concerned i am my adoptive parents son and they are jewish
7782728 i think a lot of people these days are embarrassed of being jewish
7782729 not too long ago jews even had to hide their identity this is my way of saying i am proud of it
7782730 who could believe that something so beautiful grows in something so stagnant that such beauty grows out of shit
7782731 i asked my rabbi if it was true that a jew with tattoos couldnt be buried in a jewish cemetery
7782732 he told me there are 613 laws and one of them also is not to lie but if every liar couldnt be buried in a jewish cemetery there would be no one buried there
7782733 the only problem i have ever had with the old testament is women arent represented
7782734 the only woman who always stood strong was miriam she was amazing she kept the jewish people together in the desert where a well of water followed her without her there would be nothing
7782735 he was my brother and i lost him we were inseparable now he is dead and i am not
7782736 any place a man turns his eyes to heaven is the holiest of holies
7782737 it has a lot of relevance in my life today
7782738 the whole reason to have tattoos as a jew the whole irony is that you dont need a synagogue or a structure to find god or praise god there is another way
7782739 from the new yorker to shrek the art of william steig
7782740 why are you writing about that people always think being a triplet is interesting and cool but its not
7782741 oh youre a triplet thats so cool whats that like
7782742 we were just kind of floored at the great embrace
7782743 i feel like im running a small nursery with someone i used to date
7782744 this ones over here beating this one up that ones about to fall off his chair this ones screaming for a drink and that one has to go potty
7782745 prisoners live in overcrowded poorly ventilated cells that they generally leave for only two hours a day
7782746 allegations of torture and inhuman treatment of detainees and prisoners continue such torture includes beating shackling in painful positions kicking prolonged blind cuffing denial of access to medical care exposure to extreme temperatures and inadequate provision of food and water
7782747 i hope our emotions of loss anger and feeling of betrayal are never traded for composure and acceptance
7782748 there are various unconfirmed incidents of violence being reported including a report of armed demonstrators in the area of the kabul zoo ngo should suspend all movement in the city
7782749 im just gonna speak to simon the way i speak to everybody
7782750 im just gonna have my opinion be honest and i dont foresee any problems im really excited about this and up for the challenge
7782751 its really flattering too you know to think that idol even thought about me
7782752 i mean when i got the call i thought they were calling the wrong person so im the new kid on the block and im hoping everyones gonna go easy on me and that i bring a lot to the table
7782753 im maybe not a household name but people know of me in the industry
7782754 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7782755 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7782756 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7782757 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7782758 we oppose ethnic conflict and those who support encourage it
7782759 oh yeah well my god moves mountains so mines better

7782793 this process should be something that you look forward to
7782794 exchanging cards should really be more participatory right now you buy the card you send it and thats it its very one directional a monologue
7782795 on the receiving end what do you do when you get the card you smile you laugh for a second and then you have a big decision do you throw it out put it in a drawer or hang it on the fridge the process stops it hasnt evolved
7782796 i had an epiphany that i wanted a personal life
7782797 i like creating things that a lot of people can use and be happy using
7782798 the biggest challenge is creating a card that is conservative and edgy at the same time
7782799 you dont just want to be the guy who makes the edgy cards because youll alienate a whole slew of people
7782800 dont be afraid to fail thats what stops a lot of people from trying after all last year at this time if you told me that id be a ceo of a greeting card company i would have laughed in your face
7782801 i believe that theatre is an art unlike any other because it asks for a type of bravery that is scarce in this world
7782802 we wrote letters to our friends and family who donated money to our company and once we had enough to put on a show we knew things would really start to pick up
7782803 we also used our resources and friends in other theatre programs to come and help us collaborate on this project with the directing stage managing and technical directing
7782804 this play explores what happens when people lose their inhibitions and allow their minds to wander without any boundaries
7782805 it follows the lives of three families who are distant and lost within their reality
7782806 most of the shows we hope to do are going to be ensemble based meaning that everyone shares an equal role in the creativity and process of the productions we make
7782807 our projects will ask much of our artists in mental physical and emotional ways in the end creating work that speaks a message
7782808 we are planning some pretty exciting things for next summer
7782809 however nothing is set in stone so i wont reveal too much
7782810 if he doesnt snatch the beijing olympics gold all his previous successes will come to nothing

7782812 if your horse says no you either asked the wrong question or asked the question wrong
7782813 the essence of fencing is to give but by no means to receive

7782823 without a budget and the right spending management tools do don t really know how much money you re really spending do you
7782824 the more carbs and sugars you eat the more your appetite control cells are damaged and potentially you consume more
7782825 people in the age group of 25 to 50 are most at risk the neurons that tell people in the crucial age range not to over eat are being killed off
7782826 when the stomach is empty it triggers the ghrelin hormone that notifies the brain that we are hungry when we are full a set of neurons known as pomcs kick in
7782827 however free radicals created naturally in the body attack the pomc neurons this process causes the neurons to degenerate over time affecting our judgement as to when our hunger is satisfied
7782828 a diet rich in carbohydrate and sugar that has become more and more prevalent in modern societies over the last 20 30 years has placed so much strain on our bodies that its leading to premature cell deterioration
7782829 we raided the brothels after reports that aids infected people were involved in flesh trade we have sealed three brothels
7782830 we had 38 businessmen from pakistan with various business interests
7782831 the government has already issued 93 letters of intent to private companies for setting up wind power projects
7782832 we are already running a 80 mw plant which supplies electricity to the complex and the state power board we need to generate 50 mw at least which may go up to 200 mw
7782833 there was an affinity to the ground conditions in pakistan
7782834 we have not yet decided to set up a renewable energy power plant but still exploring our options
7782835 right now we have 20 indians working in our complex in connection with setting up these two plants
7782836 when we had to get our machinery from delhi it had to be routed through mumbai to reach karachi port if we could have transported directly by road from delhi it would have saves costs
7782837 although the fate of the coalition was almost a foregone conclusion keeping events of recent days in mind the shock of the disastrous break up will have shaken everyone not least the people of pakistan many of whom must have thought that with general pervez musharrafs departure as president some semblance of stability and security would return to the country
7782838 but the coalitions collapse has disappointed them for they see further uncertainty and a blurring of the national horizon
7782839 more frighteningly besides a worsening of the economic situation the political instability could encourage the taliban to step up their war on pakistan
7782840 not who is to blame more but the consequences of the grand coalitions break up
7782841 there is no doubt that a strong sense of vindictiveness has guided the policies on the two issues with musharraf gone sharif has focused on the judges issue at the expense of other larger interests such as the economy and militancy
7782842 equally disappointing is the reality that the political parties seem to have not learnt too many lessons from the past
7782843 we may well see a return to the squabbling and bickering of the 1990s when fighting between mr sharifs party and the ppp then led by benazir bhutto often ended up paralysing government and with it governance
7782844 for example one just has to take a look at their respective stands on the war against terror and realise how dissimilar their views are
7782845 the numbers game is now on and horse trading blackmailing vote stealing and related pursuits may well re emerge as they did in the 1990s
7782846 and the worst part is that in this complete mess unleashed by the break up of the coalition the real issues of the people their security bread and butter as well as the economic challenge of tackling inflation and reducing poverty and the hydra of militancy and terrorism may well be relegated further down the governments list of priorities since it will be fighting not for the survival of its citizens but for its own
7782847 we are extremely proud of him proud of his achievements but more proud of him as a person for the way he coped with those achievements in that respect he was absolutely remarkable
7782848 were very touched that people continue to remember him as they do so long after he retired from playing cricket i suppose it the level of interest does astound us it always astounded him he couldnt understand why people still remembered him so long after hed finished playing
7782849 there is a strong case for according scheduled caste status to dalit muslims and christians
7782850 dalits in the muslim and christian communities a status report on current social scientific knowledge
7782851 a scheduled caste persons socio and economic status remains unchanged even if he changes his religion hence there is no ground to deny him benefits of affirmative action simply because he changes his creed
7782852 the present government has the determination to take bold initiatives for the welfare of the people on margins i do not foresee any reasons in not heeding and executing our recommendation
7782853 according due statutory recognition to dalit muslims and christians would not only right a wrong but would also remove an indefensible anomaly in our politico legal system that can legitimately be construed as discriminatory
7782854 based only on the descriptive and statistical evidence available there is a strong case for including dalit muslims and christians in the scheduled caste category there are compelling arguments in favour of such an inclusion based on principles of natural justice and fairness

7782879 people are looking for a gamut of services much like we do on the pc
7782880 is that a lot of people do not actually know if they have a 3g phone or not this is a reflection that carriers are shifting their communication focus away from the 3g technology towards the types of services that the technology offers
7782881 the technology doesnt mean anything to mobile phone users rather it is what the technology can do and deliver which matters to them

7782889 der rote landeshauptmann voves will sich mit seinen aussagen zur bundespolitik lediglich aus der verantwortung stehlen inhaltlich hat voves zwar v llig recht wenn er vp und sp auf bundesebene kritisiert und beide in der w hlergunst bereits unter 30 prozent sieht aber damit begibt er sich auf den weg eines roten pr ll oder p hringer die auch nichts von ihrer bundespartei wissen wollen das ist aber ein unehrlicher und populistischer weg und reine augenauswischerei
7782890 die fp sieht genug handlungsbedarf bei der steirischen landesregierung bzw der steirischen sp anstatt sich f r die steirische bev lkerung stark zu machen wird den kindern von scheinasylanten die staatsb rgerschaft verliehen um so eine abschiebung zu verhindern anstatt im rahmen der landeskompetenzen etwas gegen die teuerung zu unternehmen und so eine entlastung f r die b rger und die wirtschaft herbeizuf hren beschlie t die sp gemeinsam mit gr nen und kommunisten ein unsinniges verbot der schubhaft
7782891 die distanzierungsversuche von voves von seiner eigenen bundespartei wird der w hler jedoch ebenso durchschauen wie die versuche faymanns sich als neuen mann darzustellen das steirische ergebnis bei der nationalratswahl und die landtagswahl in der steiermark werden dies beweisen
7782892 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
7782893 engage theologically and practically with situations of controversy as they arise or divisive actions that may be taken around the communion
7782894 the forum would take under its wing those who were in dispute with liberal bishops until they could return to their parent province
7782895 the functions proposed for the pastoral forum are exactly what the primates of the communion the 38 leaders of anglican churches in different countries ed have been charged to do
7782896 there is much discomfort about the role that the primates meeting now finds itself exercising many fear it is trying to exercise too much authority perhaps their key role is in supporting the archbishop of canterbury
7782897 and the answer i hope is that we speak from the centre we should try to speak from the heart of our identity as anglicans and ultimately from that deepest centre which is our awareness of living in and as the body of christ

7782906 the new basque neptune is what the spanish media have nicknamed the basque yachtsman unai basurko who became something of a hero in euskadi during the most recent velux five oceans in 2006 2007 which indeed started and finished in his hometown of bilbao unai basurko has therefore already experienced one single handed round the world race but with stopovers moreover he was not just there to finish the former around alone race in may 2007 it was in bilbao that the basque sailor with his shaved head managed to take pakea bizkaia to third place in the final rankings after an epic transatlantic duel with a certain sir robin knox jonhston during the final leg he thus became the first spaniard to reach the winners podium in a round the world race
7782907 i felt like i was hearing the same rhetoric that id been hearing since the 60s when i started listening to and following political conventions
7782908 i wouldnt take anything away from michelle obamas remarks other than to say that this is an important election this is a big choice for the american people and theyre really going to have to rely on more than a few convention speeches

7782919 we are keeping up on your path fadel as you lay in rest
7782920 the blood of fadel shanaa will be the fuel for other cameramen and journalists to continue to convey the message to continue to report the truth to the outside world we wont be hindered or hampered by israeli actions we ask and seek the support of the united nations human rights groups and world news outlets so the killers of shanaa can be brought to justice
7782921 the killers of shanaa must be punished the blood of shanaa and that of the eight children must not be wasted
7782922 the israeli soldiers intentionally killed this journalist as he was not in a place of danger he was wearing a vest marked with the word press on it he was filming about 750 meters away from the israeli tank but the israeli tank shelled and killed him intentionally in an attempt to blackout an israeli invasion of the middle area of the gaza strip at that particular day
7782923 at least three people have been arrested in the us over an alleged plot to kill us democratic presidential hopeful

7782925 he is believed to have been snatching bags for four to five years our investigators had been calling him the chameleon as he changed clothes or wore camouflage outfits to merge into the background
7782926 by the time we radioed in that the culprit was wearing black clothes he was wearing white or red

7782928 food and drug sweetener strategy that they feel will put the fda into a positive frame of mind about aspartame an internal policy memo describes psychological tactics the company should use to bring the fda into a subconscious spirit of participation
7782929 the information provided by searle is inadequate to permit an evaluation of the potential toxicity of aspartame
7782930 has not been presented with proof of reasonable certainty that aspartame is safe for use as a food additive
7782931 would you rather have those guys working on that or doing something new
7782932 the operating environment for wine remains difficult supplies are increasing and their brands dont have strong momentum
7782933 but fosters also realized very strong pricing in beer the issue there is the sustainability of this kind of price growth
7782934 in middle school your parents do more for you but in high school its all on you
7782935 to go from being big man on campus in middle school to little man on campus in high school is traumatic
7782936 at 14 students are right on the cusp some of them are still children you see girls carrying around stuffed animals and a lot of kids still watch cartoons but they are also in puberty and part of that means trying to assert themselves and forge an identity
7782937 theres a lot of pressure to figure out not only who you are but where you want to go in life
7782938 any point of transition in our lives is a major challenge if you think of marriage or divorce or having children going to college starting a new job any time we reach a point of transition we need support
7782939 the key to high school success is a strong ninth grade foundation
7782940 students who get off to a weak start easily get discouraged and have a lot of trouble in 10th and 11th grade its all about engagement and connection kids need to feel connected to school
7782941 they probably do like you but they are being tough on you because they want you to pass
7782942 you cant go to the counselors and say you want to switch a class because the teacher doesnt like you they wont buy that but dont be afraid to ask your teachers for help thats their job
7782943 if the government sits there doing nothing the economy willslow down significantly
7782944 although there isnt much new here darnton writes a very careful and thoughtful overview of the topic and isnt afraid to call out google for its quixotic efforts to digitize all knowledge
7782945 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7782946 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7782947 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7782948 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7782949 regarding u s policy on settlements its clear its the right policy to try to help bring about a political settlement between israel and the palestinians
7782950 are you saying you can get a charitable deduction for helping starving people in new york city but you cant get a charitable deduction for helping starving people in judea and samaria
7782951 either they stop the settlements or they stop talking about a two state solution
7782952 the u s government has no right to use political considerations when judging humanitarian and non profit needs
7782953 dozens of new families can now come live in hebron only if we renovate this building quickly
7782954 these settlements are supposed to be the nail in the coffin of any future peace agreement with the palestinians
7782955 this place is holy to the jewish people and we have a duty to be here
7782956 the whole land of israel belongs to us and we should not be afraid to live wherever we want to the arabs must accept that
7782957 we are connected to the water grid we have phone lines from the national company bezeq we have been hooked up by the electricity company and have street lighting
7782958 we also have a kindergarten paid for by the state and a group of soldiers stationed here to protect us how can we be illegal
7782959 we can also see all the arabs from here and keep an eye on what they are doing
7782960 and in addition we can see the other settlements and check on their safety
7782961 they are very afraid that this will become simply the first of many settlements to fall
7782962 the settlers know that preparation of an alternative site could take years
7782963 the danger is that migron will be destroyed only to be resurrected in legalized form by the government as a new settlement close by adam
7782964 we believe it is possible to find a solution for the outposts that will strengthen the settlements
7782965 it would be a big mistake if we give up what is rightfully ours
7782966 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7782967 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7782968 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7782969 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7782970 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7782971 the groups performance in the first half together with our growth potential supports the boards view that rio tinto presents a very strong stand alone value proposition for shareholders
7782972 the driver of demand for our products is urbanisation and industrialisation in heavily populated countries like china and india and these economies continue to grow strongly
7782973 while the equity markets are currently focussed on downside risks we believe there are potential offsets on the upside based on continued strength in commodity demand low inventory levels and a supply side which continues to face multiple constraints
7782974 national foods has the capability and financial strength to leverage the acquisition of acf to create new business opportunities domestically and in the vitally important asian region
7782975 we will seek to reach an agreement on thiswith grave resolution
7782976 what is important is to get the support of the people and todo that we have to take policy steps
7782977 we are interested in daewoo shipbuilding and will submit aletter of intent tomorrow
7782978 while the equity markets are currently focused on downside risks we believe there are potential offsets on the upside based on continued strength in commodity demand low inventory levels and a supply side which continues to face multiple constraints
7782979 the group continues to perform strongly and the outlook remains positive
7782980 the headline profit number is certainly well ahead of expectations and the commentary associated with numbers appears very positive at this point in time
7782981 rios exposure to the bulk commodities sector has been extremely beneficial for the company and i think that the results will be very positively received by the market
7782982 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7782983 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7782984 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7782985 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7782986 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7782987 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7782988 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7782989 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7782990 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7782991 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7782992 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7782993 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7782994 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7782995 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7782996 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7782997 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7782998 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7782999 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7783000 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7783001 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7783002 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7783003 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7783004 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7783005 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7783006 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7783007 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7783008 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7783009 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7783010 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7783011 den som ikke er radikal i sitt ungdom har ikke hjerte og den som ikke er konservativ n r en blir eldre har ikke hjerne

7783014 we think shearing has as much right to be called a sport as any commonwealth or national games event
7783015 shearers should be up there with other australian sporting champions
7783016 some of these guys train for months to be at their physical best theyre going to the gym and doing yoga and following special diets theyre outstanding athletes
7783017 if people could see the skill that is involved theyd be interested

7783031 i am aware he was writing a lot of articles in that magazine and was part of the publishing team
7783032 by the time its like 7 or 8 in the evening im already i cant keep my eyes open
7783033 to be honest i was quite nervous tonight i dont know why
7783034 at the start i might thave been a little out of sorts
7783035 it came down to a couple of points here and there and i said before that i hope that my experience would get me through
7783036 im not really disappointed because of how i played on that stage
7783037 i would not have been as happy if it went the way the first set went or the third set
7783038 i think i helped him a little bit to play this level
7783039 i didnt play with normal intensity i play a little bit less intense than last few months for sure probably im a little bit tired more than i usually am the problem is play cincinnati beijing and come back here
7783040 we only average on the final saturday about 23 000
7783041 if we got less than 30 000 id be disappointed as long as the weather holds up we should finish very strongly
7783042 this place was a big contribution to how he performed last year going into the fall and the breeders cup
7783043 the biggest part of him is the part we cant see and thats his heart
7783044 hes about as perfectly made as you would want were very fortunate to have him
7783045 were going to go over there and give it our best shot
7783046 were going to hope that the mystique of saratoga the graveyard of champions the man o war upset we need all of those stars to align and all the planets to align hes a better horse at this stage but well see things happen
7783047 for the oil year 2007 08 we have already lost one million tons of food demand and about 5 00 000 tons of bio diesel demand as a result of high prices
7783048 incremental supply exceeded incremental demand by almost 1 5 million tonnes and the bulk of this excess has come in the second half of the year
7783049 i believe the strong price rises of the first quarter of 2008 finally began to meet resistance in the second quarter and got reflected in the volume of business transaction during june
7783050 we saw strong evidence of this in the case of sunflower oil and soya oil
7783051 we are already seeing big increase in the production of sunseed and rapeseed
7783052 were harvard were like the most prominent national institution and i think we should be entitled to we should be able to get anyone and in my opinion were settling here
7783053 i read the other day that canada throwed that guy out
7783054 good for them the day jimmy carter became president he welcomed all the draft dodgers home i didnt like that oh no i had no time for him after that
7783055 what they should have done is extradited him directly to the u s because hes being deported hes still free
7783056 its way past time for this guy to face the music
7783057 canada was wrong to rule against jeremy and his family all they seek is to live in peace
7783058 i think he should lose a lot of privileges that red blooded americans have
7783059 he shouldnt be able to hold any state or federal jobs
7783060 ive had the opportunity to speak out against the war no offense to the soldiers over there i have respect for them as soldiers but it was a bogus war based on false pretenses and im happy to have not taken part in it
7783061 they should round him up and have him executed all deserters should be executed on the spot in times of war deserters should be executed
7783062 ill tell them i went through basic training served in the 82nd for three years also i applied for conscientious objectors status and was denied i tried to work within the provisions of the army just because youre a soldier doesnt mean you abdicate your responsibility to be a moral being
7783063 ill end up with whatever they want to give me
7783064 he knew what he was getting into i just thought it was wrong
7783065 maybe if he had a chance and fulfilled his obligation if thats even possible
7783066 then you wonder if he had the kids to avoid going to jail but still
7783067 most of those guys got drafted in if they were a conscientious objector it wasnt their choice when you go to a recruiting station and sign a contract you need to honor the contract read the fine print no i do not have any compassion for this guy
7783068 i feel it is every persons duty to serve if theyre able to i felt like i had to do it as a citizen of the freest nation
7783069 theres no draft anymore he didnt get drafted into the army
7783070 he chose it as a career thats just like me choosing to come to certified brake no matter how tough it gets i have to stick with it these guys choose it for a career he turned his back on the united states the way i see it
7783071 they ought to give him a double dose because he volunteered for it
7783072 i hope there are lots of people in fayetteville even though they feel differently about the war than he does who would be able to respect the kind of integrity and courage he has shown
7783073 we can look at it as an army command issue
7783074 but it really comes down to a husband and wife issue
7783075 they say if he can do it i can too it happens a lot
7783076 if theres somebody here whos friendly to her and pays attention to her guess what shes real open to an affair
7783077 youve got dummies over there who either dont care or theyre trying to get back at their wives but me man its not worth losing your rank over your moneys your money
7783078 when theyre cheating its up to them to live with it because its eventually going to come out
7783079 theyll blame the deployments and the hardships and such i personally dont buy it
7783080 i know a number of soldiers who have deployed who have not cheated and to turn around and just if thats your excuse its a crutch and its a lie
7783081 i would really be hard pressed to say that infidelity is more prevalent in the military
7783082 i do not think thats an issue i seem to run into it as much in the civilian community as in the military community
7783083 what other business what other organization provides a family support group
7783084 joe cannot afford to deploy and question whats going on at the home front he or she has to concentrate on what the mission is while deployed
7783085 its like we recruit the soldier but we re enlist the family and the family needs to know that being part of the military is not going to be harmful to their marriage
7783086 some are in uniform some are in wedding dresses and suits some are in casual clothes
7783087 we just want to get it knocked out and go celebrate
7783088 and theyre not ready financially and they dont have maturity and they dont have the emotional skills for what it takes to be committed to a marriage
7783089 persons of senior status higher ranking officers and noncommissioned officers
7783090 most of my clients are persons of substance if you will
7783091 if infidelity takes place its because theres brokenness in another part of a persons life
7783092 an affair is just a dimension of a destructive addictive behavior lets get beyond the symptom what is it that is in you thats causing you to risk a great deal and do you have any evidence that this relationship the one you left or the one youve begun has eased the pain within your heart and your soul
7783093 soldiers can compartmentalize tune out the emotion in order to do their jobs effectively
7783094 they are traits that arent necessarily good for a relationship
7783095 its cumulative you can lose sleep one night maybe two but after a while your body shuts down
7783096 the operational tempo of the military is just wearing down the families
7783097 it has a number of adverse effects and one of those adverse effects is affairs
7783098 if theyre willing to work on it not just the affair but the underlying issues
7783099 it will never be like their old marriage but it will be their new normal
7783100 usually when theres a big deployment thats when i get most of my calls i get calls from afghanistan and iraq we get calls from everywhere
7783101 weve had some cases that would totally blow your mind
7783102 if she hadnt joined the army wed still be together
7783103 you cant deal with the flow the numbers are against you
7783104 the disadvantage of that is that we have nothing to go off of
7783105 but the advantage is that we really get to set the direction for agriculture in ghazni province
7783106 the commanders on the ground want as many of these teams as they can get
7783107 they see the good in what the teams can do long term to turn the tide and create stability in the farming regions
7783108 there has been some but not enough to meet the needs of afghanistan revitalizing agriculture is one of the key priorities for our government to the extent that we get technical assistance in military form or civilian form it helps us a great deal
7783109 ive been an infantry officer my entire career 25 years
7783110 this is very different i always thought my command would be in a combat mission but this is a good mission you really get to see the effects youre having
7783111 the challenges weve had getting states on board is because the guard is so busy with missions throughout the theater
7783112 we compete with resources with the entire national guard but having said that the local farm boys of the army guard have come out of the woodwork
7783113 it looks like barren wasteland until you drop water on it
7783114 i dont know what kind of magic stuff is in the soil
7783115 we have not seen any in ghazni but if we did we would not do anything about it thats another units job
7783116 whatever they can sell their harvest for at that time is what they get the rest of it goes to waste they have no means to store it or preserve it
7783117 whatever they can capture and collect at their spot is what they have available water management is the largest issue and it cannot be resolved in one year it will be handed off to future teams
7783118 just in the small amount of time our boys have been on the ground theyve gone after some quick hit infrastructure support projects to start making a turn for the local farmers
7783119 we need technical expertise to use in that secure environment
7783120 thats part of an effective counterinsurgency strategy if we dont help the people with their livelihoods and create jobs it will be really hard to win their hearts and minds
7783121 unlikely suitor high concept hijinks unnecessary obstacle true love happy ending

7783123 first youre happy youre all safe then you realize you dont have any pictures anymore
7783124 we are here for one purpose to give the party momentum going into the general election so that come november barack obama will become the president of the united states
7783125 now in a first for me im supporting a republican john mccain i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment
7783126 im here to tell you my name is hillary clinton and i do not support this message
7783127 if he wants to win the election he needs to get the vast majority of hillary supporters her strongest support is where hes weakest white working class men and women
7783128 absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes senator clinton has pledged wholehearted support to my campaign as has president clinton
7783129 they have to make those voters comfortable with barack obama have to make them think hes part of the american dream
7783130 we are witnessing the growth of the mobile phone in peoples lives as it starts to pack more smarts and deliver on the promise of vibrant on demand information and entertainment
7783131 people are looking for a gamut of services much like we do on the pc
7783132 is that a lot of people do not actually know if they have a 3g phone or not this is a reflection that carriers are shifting their communication focus away from the 3g technology towards the types of services that the technology offers
7783133 the technology doesnt mean anything to mobile phone users rather it is what the technology can do and deliver which matters to them
7783134 many times documents are printed when they could really be dealt with in digital form
7783135 we can work with customers to show them how to build systems that actually reduce the volume of paper in their organisation
7783136 in response to these events we have determined that further alterations are required to prevent such battles from exceeding a certain predetermined length of time
7783137 included in the version update scheduled for early september will be modifications to the degree of difficulty of pandemonium warden and associated pets absolute virtue and associated pets and jailer of love the aim of these changes is to create battles where a decisive outcome may be reached within a shorter period of time

7783141 the party is meeting this morning to look at our position in parliament and whether we are participating or not
7783142 as a party we are contesting the legitimacy of mr mugabe but since we are now in control of parliament that has to be put into perspective
7783143 a violation repudiation of some of the conditions on the memorandum of understanding

7783146 digital photography illustration is an exciting combination of straight forward photography and fine art expressionist painting
7783147 its exciting to know that i can take a rather ordinary portrait and through digital enhancement i can bring out the best in the image or the person by adding excitement adding interesting drama and vibrant energy and enhancing the colors i like to call them portraits with pizzaz
7783148 as a former professional photographer i appreciate the work that goes into a photo shoot i also know how frustrating it can be when those images are less than spectacular that is why im now working with photographers helping to take their photography portraits and turning them into spectacular works of art
7783149 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7783150 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7783151 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7783152 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7783153 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7783154 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7783155 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7783156 who are open to doing something on the production side
7783157 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7783158 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7783159 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7783160 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7783161 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7783162 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7783163 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7783164 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7783165 we are now controlling most of the key government offices to prevent them from coming to work
7783166 today we declare a long long holiday for the government
7783167 we are extremely proud of him proud of his achievements but more proud of him as a person for the way he coped with those achievements in that respect he was absolutely remarkable
7783168 were very touched that people continue to remember him as they do so long after he retired from playing cricket i suppose it the level of interest does astound us it always astounded him he couldnt understand why people still remembered him so long after hed finished playing
7783169 faites ce que je dis mais ne faites pas ce que fais
7783170 we just need to go back and have more discussion
7783171 now that cooler heads have prevailed i hope we can all move forward and constructively address the real budget challenges facing our city
7783172 it wasnt voted down it was only pulled for the time being
7783173 thats part of the guideposts that well be giving as the administration looks at other agreements
7783174 good faith efforts to hire a diverse mid michigan work force
7783175 it set some good examples in place for us for future consideration
7783176 but i do think that flexibility is really important and we need to make sure each development agreement is judged on a case by case basis
7783177 without a cause of death you dont have a case
7783178 based on the evidence and the record we have generated monday i will determine whether or not its appropriate to continue
7783179 affirms judge collette then that would be the end of this case
7783180 everyone just knows you can take it its pretty nice
7783181 i love the cucumbers and the peppers are so fresh its so hard to get stuff like that at the stores
7783182 and i would say almost every customer goes out with something
7783183 last year i think we had just sporadic here and there
7783184 this year it seems like a constant flow of veggies coming in more and more people are coming in and grabbing stuff

7783186 the new assignment for one of mayora new brands would be a great challenge for the agency and also another exciting opportunity to be part of mayoras growth
7783187 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7783188 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7783189 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7783190 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7783191 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7783192 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7783193 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7783194 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7783195 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7783196 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7783197 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7783198 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7783199 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7783200 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7783201 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7783202 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7783203 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7783204 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7783205 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7783206 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7783207 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7783208 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7783209 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7783210 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7783211 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7783212 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7783213 chinese refiners are unable to match gains from the high price of crude oil in international markets due to controls on retail prices
7783214 they should take advantage of this opportunity to adjust retail prices
7783215 the economy and the stock market do better under democratic administrations
7783216 artists raise their kids differently we have art around the house we have books we go to plays we talk our focus is art and painting and dress up and singing its what we love so i think you can see how artists in some way raise other artists

7783288 pc tools is a global leader in innovative software products designed to protect the privacy and security of windows computer users
7783289 i would definitely not advise to possibly get into ranbaxy right now if you are holding on to the share at possibly lower level then i would recommend that you hold on to it if the quantity is small wait in for the buyback to possibly go through in case if somebody wants to buy it at lower levels i would wait for the entire process of buyback to get over there is a lot of talk about exclusivity and all that possibly going forward and of course the acquisition in the european markets all this will possibly unfold over a year year and a half so hold on to it in case if i am a small investor give 20 in the buyback but not really buy it at these levels
7783290 if somebody wants to get into the pharma i think midcap pharma makes a lot of sense to me something like glenmark lupin which has already been buzzing for the last two three days sun pharma or even divis laboratories i think these are some of the four five stocks in the midcap pharma that i would look at in case if i want to get invested afresh
7783291 on the construction sector i am not that negative but on unitech definitely yes the kind of the value erosion that we have seen on unitech it is a cause of concern and of course the fact that it had been in the news about a month or month and a half back wherein i think the concerns on the companys ability to fund its incomplete projects and the projects which will possibly come on is definitely a big question mark it is going to have a lot of difficulty as far as the upside is concerned because a lot of overhead supply is going to come a lot of taps are going to get opened up those people who got possibly stuck at higher levels will possibly want to unwind
7783292 if one can minimize the losses one should get out of it if one really want to look at real estate then i think hdil would be a better choice indiabulls real estate possibly at lower end would be a better choice but herein again one would need to have a very long time horizon unless and until the interest scenario peaks out starts correcting downwards inflation starts correcting downwards i think there is going to be a lot of difficulty for the real estate players to possibly generate cash for their projects to be completed
7783293 one should strictly stay away from real estate for the time being there are better sectors look at like oil exploration oil refining capital goods engineering pharma wherein some midcap pharma names i suggested i think it will make sense to possibly look at those sectors

7783319 the only safe predictions to make about todays decision are that it will likely raise the price of goods at retail and that it will create considerable legal turbulence as lower courts seek to develop workable principles
7783320 the stores are telling manufacturers keep those prices up among my rivals or we wont buy from you
7783321 it looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7783322 weve got our fingers crossed that things will improve but there is the recognition that there is still a long way to go yet

7783333 private equity fund presence in turkey dates back only 10 years a global liquidity surplus before 2007 and the overall confidence and stability caused an increase in the number and the volume of private equity funds in turkey
7783334 thus the amount of private equity fund investments in turkey which was 2 4 billion in 2006 and 2 billion in 2007 has reached 2 billion as of the first six months of 2008 figures show that turkey is still a magnet for private equity investors

7783415 i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming
7783416 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
7783417 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7783418 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7783419 scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves
7783420 the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7783421 hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
7783422 and as i tuck that little girl and her little sister into bed at night i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming
7783423 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country and not just because barack has done well but because i think people are hungry for change
7783424 i just wanted to make the statement that i have and always will be proud of my country
7783425 what i was clearly talking about was that im proud in how americans are engaging in the political process
7783426 who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and our sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7783427 whos never forgotten where he came from and never stopped fighting for folks who work long hours and face long odds and need someone on their side again
7783428 who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling
7783429 as the person who knows him best theres no one who can do a better job introducing barack obama to the country
7783430 upbringing and the values that have shaped her as a mother wife daughter sister mentor and dedicated community service advocate
7783431 i come here tonight as a sister blessed with a brother who is my mentor my protector and my lifelong friend
7783432 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night
7783433 over the last 19 months mrs obama has demonstrated a unique ability to connect with people across the country on the campaign trail and share in their american experience
7783434 people have come away from her campaign events knowing that they will have a first lady who truly understands their challenges and is committed to helping women and families
7783435 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7783436 and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7783437 like many moms shes learned to juggle the responsibilities of work and family
7783438 she knows what its like for millions of women who face the same challenges every day shes made a career of bringing people together and finding solutions to seemingly intractable problems in her community and thats exactly what shell do as first lady
7783439 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no we need a persistent president
7783440 the population of georgia will feel more safe from today from the russian aggression
7783441 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7783442 i dont think such a buildup will foster the stabilization of the atmosphere in the region
7783443 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7783444 right after the conflict with georgia russia would look very indecent if it immediately annexed south ossetia and abkhazia
7783445 after the georgian leadership lost their marbles as they say all the problems got worse and a military conflict erupted
7783446 and i believe we should handle other existing conflicts in this context
7783447 we have agreed to meet and discuss the transdniestria settlement
7783448 i think there is a good reason to do this today i see good prospects of reaching a settlement
7783449 thank god during all these years we had enough brains and reserve not to allow a similar deterioration of situation
7783450 frozen conflicts are a real volcano which can blow up anytime
7783451 that is why taking into account what had happened elsewhere it would be useful if we exercised again such wisdom not to allow such things to repeat in our country
7783452 we will not rest until the prisoners are freed and the jails are empty
7783453 we had lost hope that my brother would be released because hes been in prison for 32 years
7783454 its not easy for israel to release prisoners some of the individuals being released today are guilty of direct involvement in the murder of innocent civilians
7783455 but we understand the importance of the prisoner issue for palestinian society we believe this action can support the negotiation process and create goodwill
7783456 he is our brother and we must struggle to free all prisoners abbas said
7783457 je pense quil ne sagit pas dun secret jai dit mes interlocuteurs isra liens que je ne pensais pas que les activit s de colonisation aident au processus
7783458 ce dont nous avons besoin maintenant ce sont des mesures qui renforcent la confiance entre les deux parties et tout ce qui peut miner cette confiance doit tre vit
7783459 en fin de compte le r le des dirigeants est de tenter de trouver un moyen de vivre en paix lavenir et ne pas laisser le moindre bruit li la situation sur le terrain se faire entendre dans la salle de n gociations
7783460 la politique du gouvernement isra lien nest pas dagrandir les implantations de construire de nouvelles implantations ou de confisquer des terres palestiniennes

7783470 the caspian region is wondering what this means for the future
7783471 after the military conflict with russia georgia cannot be marked on oil and gas maps as a safe transit route and no amount of support from nato can change this alteration
7783472 has always looked more like a diplomats pipe dream than a viable economic project
7783473 its promoters had not only failed to secure supply and transit agreements but also had yet to identify an oil company eager to champion the project and finance the pipeline
7783474 the time has come to define a candidate for the next chair we suggest to elect one of the cica active participants turkey
7783475 around 20 police patrolled around our camp their constantly presence was psychological pressure
7783476 friday the governor decided to evict the camp they also did not allow us to stage any activity when we protested the decision they abruptly arrested us in custody they did not let us meet an arriving lawyer nor did they accept the foreigners demand for a translator

7783494 it is great to see that the policy is giving more children those learning opportunities in their early years and helping families along the way
7783495 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation

7783497 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7783498 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7783499 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7783500 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7783501 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7783502 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7783503 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7783504 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7783505 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7783506 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7783507 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7783508 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7783509 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7783510 we therefore feel that these repeated defaults and violations have forced us to withdraw our support from the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches
7783511 the album went as far as it could back home
7783512 the response has been really good makes our job easier
7783513 we are delighted to bring this new service to the mena region as this has been already used by lloyds of london and extensively in the us two of the leading insurance markets in the world the service will distribute and administer both conventional and takaful insurance products and will be available for use by insurance providers bancassurers brokers and affinity groups
7783514 product innovation is one of the biggest inhibitors to the development of the insurance industry in mena the unirisx einsurance service from eastnets will allow insurers to develop innovative new products and launch them into the market at a fraction of the cost and in timeframes that have never previously been feasible the einsurance portal will accelerate the pace of competition and offer better choices to both consumers and corporate groups
7783515 at the gaif 2008 conference in bahrain earlier this year 60 per cent of delegates thought that outsourcing was going to become more important in the next three years the software as a service model we are now bringing to the region represents the fastest growing form of outsourcing by linking risk to reward it substantially reduces costs and project risk given that we already provide outsourcing services to some 800 banks worldwide this initiative represents a natural complementary extension to our activities and expertise
7783516 the straight through processing aspects of the service will enable providers to administer more efficiently allowing them to do a lot more work with the same headcount as such it will help alleviate the critical skills shortage which insurers in the mena region are experiencing
7783517 the deal essentially gives us flat margins from now through 2009
7783518 as margins drive insurance broker stocks investing in the company becomes suitable only for investors with a longer term strategy
7783519 we are currently negotiating with four investment firms and hope to finalise the deals before the end of the year
7783520 these major funds need large minimum capital to invest in them for example at least dh10 000 however our clients can invest in such funds for as little as dh200 per month through salamas accounts in these funds
7783521 salama presents an assembly of diverse shariah compliant unit linked insurance products to its clients and the funds of oasis crescent can be accessed through these products for as little as dh200 per month
7783522 salama has entered into several strategic tie ups with eminent islamic fund management companies to spread shariah compliant savings and insurance products within the uae we entered into this collaboration with oasis crescent to allow the public to have access to the funds from this award winning company
7783523 we started from a very low base but the scheme is achieving 100 per cent growth every month the islamic life insurance scheme made great progress during the first quarter since we started and this is very exciting for the takaful business in the country
7783524 the technology available today is light years ahead of what was generally available just five years ago
7783525 add those advancements to increasing technical expertise as we learn more about graphically creating immersive worlds and the conditions are right to have graphics play a major role in telling the story of a game
7783526 cevat yerli and crytek are not only major names in germany but also the global videogame market his keynote will be one of the highlights of the conference and im confident hell inspire the audience to view graphics as an element that is finally capable of telling stories on the level of cinema
7783527 gamesindustry biz is a vital and relevant news channel for the video game industry and a daily must read site
7783528 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7783529 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7783530 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7783531 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7783532 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7783533 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7783534 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7783535 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7783536 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7783537 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510

7783547 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7783548 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7783549 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7783550 trim your pork chops but leave a little of the good stuff on it

7783552 does this offend you john 6 60 61 jesus so many in your church are offended by what you have said and done help us to receive your words what then if you should see the son of man ascend where he was before john 6 62 holy spirit help your church and your people believe the deeds that jesus has done for us it is the spirit who gives life the flesh profits nothing the words that i speak to you are spirit and they are life john 6 63 jesus please speak your words of spirit and life to the episcopal church today it has become mired in the flesh restore it to a life in your spirit but there are some of you who do not believe
7783553 therefore i have said to you that no one can come to me unless it has been granted to him by my father
7783554 significar um desastre para as comunidades ind genas em todo pa s
7783555 ativistas receberam a cria o da raposa serra do sol como um ato hist rico para proteger os povos ind genas do pa s de contato com o mundo exterior
7783556 quase todos os n o abor gines precisam de permiss o legal para entrar nas terras ind genas mas diversos produtores de arroz continuam operando dentro da reserva eles descrevem a demarca o da raposa serra do sol como um obst culo para o desenvolvimento econ mico e apontam para o fato de que h grandes n meros de abor gines entre seus empregados
7783557 v em a reserva como uma amea a seguran a nacional
7783558 n o seria uma competi o de miss com passarela e desfiles mas um concurso de beleza global n o apenas exterior mas interior
7783559 meu superior ficou confuso e provavelmente foi contatado pela santa s n o entenderam que se trata de um blog as freiras se apresentariam com udio e v deo e poderiam ser votadas com base na op o de vida religiosa que representam claro que tendo uma bela foto o aspecto f sico tamb m seria votado h algo de mal nisso
7783560 sem discriminar as outras as brasileiras s o mais alegres e joviais quem esteve no brasil sabe como vivem um povo alegre elas levam esta espiritualidade da alegria s comunidades religiosas onde v o neste sentido uma beleza que se transfere em comportamentos atitudes e felicidade pela escolha que fizeram
7783561 preciso valorizar as novas linguagens a nova m dia para levar o bem
7783562 suspendi porque come aram a chegar provoca es em v deos e fotos que nada tinham a ver com o argumento enviados por pessoas que desejam deturpar a boa iniciativa que nem era minha
7783563 elas me diziam porque n o organizar a visibilidade dos institutos num blog onde as freiras contariam suas experi ncias
7783564 todos os trabalhos s o v lidos um completa o outro
7783565 n o estou fazendo nada de mal uma forma moderna de promover a imagem das freiras que n o s o aquelas velhas que querem nos mostrar s o diplomadas inteligentes preparadas e poderiam ter uma visibilidade at por sua beleza f sica n o vejo porque se escandalizar
7783566 acho dif cil que ele consiga criar esse concurso se quiser mesmo divulgar o trabalho das irm s atrav s da elei o de miss meio estranho mas quem sabe
7783567 estamos beneficiando a maior parte do funcionalismo 60 da folha de pagamento que contempla tamb m aposentados e pensionistas que sempre ficavam de fora dos reajustes mesmo sendo recomenda o t cnica

7783571 we are giving priority to the transportation of iranian gas to the european markets through turkey
7783572 however now our toilet culture includes sit down toilets with a flush vanity mirrors liquid soap and towels
7783573 2 classification but it turned out totally fine and a welcome challenge
7783574 where were you until now why were you silent the government is trying to do something now why didnt you do anything when the fish farms were first built there is this tendency to hit at the government and tayyip erdo an no matter what you dont have the right
7783575 just ask those who prance around saying i am an environmentalist what have they done for the world or the environment who are they they are just people who try to do something with their spare time
7783576 we have signed the kyoto protocol did they even stop to say thank you
7783577 what will you environmentalists do when there is no electricity tomorrow
7783578 the first nuclear plant will be built in akkuyu in the mersin province on the mediterranean coast
7783579 some may dream of winning diyarbak r we do not have the slightest concern for the city we will be stronger than we were in the july 22 local elections
7783580 there are many kurdish voters in zmir we have a significant vote potential in zmir that may change the fate of zmir this may have an impact on the municipality we will come up with a formula
7783581 people still call an ambulance for only half of urgent cases the rates for calling emergency services in some cities are even less than the half
7783582 112 emergency staff get information about a patients condition by asking questions and can then inform the caller how to best treat the patient if the case requires an ambulance staff immediately send an ambulance to the scene of the accident
7783583 besides available measures to prevent these calls we will also take additional ones we are also investigating the judicial dimension of the situation
7783584 i do have utmost respect for democratic decision taken by the people however i previously announced on behalf of the tsk that i cannot work with g l so i should be consistent i ask my forgiveness and request of my people to understand my sensitivities
7783585 if there hadnt been brussels we couldve changed its name and proceed with the reforms program
7783586 societies are like big sausages from whichever section you take a slice cut more or less there is equal amount of fat meat and other ingredients
7783587 the one who has the honey jar licks his finger
7783588 my wife is sick but i am happy with her in this region relatives have too much power over each others lives when my wife got sick she couldnt go to the field to work thats why they want to send her back
7783589 i want them to leave us alone i have a happy life i dont want to die or kill we want the state to protect us
7783590 we did not abuse the rights of orphans and we will not let anyone either
7783591 the fundamental obstacle for future armenian turkish relations is our lack of trust in turkey as well as the fact that we are not hopeful that turkey will become our reliable partner
7783592 when these things get thrown at you you actually try that much harder he thaksin is even more adamant now because this is his love and he wants to show people he is really committed
7783593 i asked the question as well as everyone else is the club for sale and he is quite adamant this club is not for sale and he is here for the long haul
7783594 i asked why did you buy it he said he bought it because there is a 10 year plan
7783595 i dont know my schedule for next year i will be hitting golf balls at the beginning of the year
7783596 we beat ankara and istanbul with regards to the number of projects which were prepared at schools and approved by the national agency this year
7783597 as a provincial directorate of education we established the eu projects unit in 2004 we trained over 10 000 teachers for the projects now we can enjoy the fruits of our hard work disseminating the project culture is a cornerstone in increasing the quality of education education must be assessed according to the projects in order to decide the quality of a school
7783598 the project culture has been improving year by year the donation was 820 000 euro last year but it increased by 96 percent this year if the alternative projects are also approved the number will increase more and more
7783599 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open
7783600 i think he definitely didnt have his best day against me but playing him nine times i guess hes bound to have one off day out of all of them because there are times when i felt like there was nothing i could do
7783601 the goal is still the same and the pressure is still the same
7783602 the goal is to continue to improve my tennis and to continue playing a very good tournament
7783603 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7783604 so it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces now maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me and it should be interesting
7783605 i think its tough to play perfect for five years in a row
7783606 i think one big result and its turned around for him
7783607 thats the plan but i dont think either one of us is aiming for two
7783608 the bays where tourists once swam and boats anchored have been turned into cesspools
7783609 thousands of fish continue to die in the coves next week we are going to collect evidence in the presence of a notary and sue to stop the new plan by the ministry to move the farms
7783610 forty out of 50 coves where farms are now located are currently out of use since there is a lot of pollution and also farms have closed the entrances of some coves so local vacationers and tourists can no longer swim in the kaynar g vercinlik zeytinli ada ziraat adas am p nar and tav an bays bays are full of cages cans fishnets and solid wastes from the farms
7783611 in our tours with yachts our visitors were going to g kova every year this year they wanted to visit the northern part of the island the g ll k bay i have seen how the gleaming bays visited by blue cruises have been turned into hell because of the farms
7783612 i couldnt find a single word to say when i saw cows in am bay where tourists once swam and yachts had anchored
7783613 is it right to sacrifice our beauty for the sake of one sector to gain a little we had to abort the blue cruise and turn back we are ashamed for our tourists
7783614 forty of 50 farms in g ll k bay turned into cesspools due to the farms
7783615 now we cant even see one meter down into the sea while before we were able to see down 20 meters neither tourists nor the local public can swim in the region where fish begin to die and the bay beds have been turned into cesspools full of ooze and mud until 10 years ago each year about 4 000 local and foreign yachts were anchoring in the g ll k bay and providing important revenue for the region currently yachts avoid the g ll k bay and tours removed the region from their tour maps both fish and fisheries are dead
7783616 fifteen years ago while fish farms were being established in the bay we were told that there would be fish deaths this has happened
7783617 different reasons were suggested when about 4 million fish died at the beginning of this year currently while there are no explanations as to why fish deaths occur there are also no brooks that carry industrial wastes into the area we have witnessed the worst example of destroying a heaven as a result of unplanned building and for the sake of income we have observed that fish are dying
7783618 we knew that deaths occurring six months ago had stopped fish deaths have not occurred in the above named region but i will instantly charge the authorities of district directorate of agriculture in order to continue this case

7783626 here at stopbadware org weve found apple to be equally uncommunicative a couple months ago when we notified them that we were preparing a badware alert about apple software update they quietly changed the product at the 11th hour but never contacted us about it more recently weve tried to contact several senior executives there to initiate an informal low pressure conversation about their disclosure practices but our invitation has gone unanswered no one is questioning apples ability to design a neat product or generate enthusiasm about a product launch failing to engage with the security and user communities however is a different thing entirely and one in which apple is coming up short its time for the folks in cupertino to change their i tune and start loosening their lips

7783646 political crises like last years debate over the presidential elections or the closure case against the ruling justice and development party are hampering the countrys political stability and therefore the eu accession process
7783647 as a result key reforms get interrupted on certain points of the legal and political system this years crisis manifested the urgency of implementing legal and constitutional reforms
7783648 the european commission has been advising turkey to change its political parties law for the last three years however the government did not make any moves on the issue despite the fact that there were filed lawsuits for the closure of political parties even before the latest cases
7783649 it can establish trust in people that their rights will be protected whatever their religious or political affiliations are it can also secure that the process of high level appointments will be monitored and these are made based on the principle of impartiality and merit
7783650 however the ombudsman law has waited in the constitutional court for over two years
7783651 i am curiously waiting for the announcement of the program
7783652 the union will continue to support turkeys reform efforts we are in close dialogue with turkey for this and we provide financial assistance for the implementation of reforms the aid which exceeded 500 million euros last year will continue increasing
7783653 the commission is aiming at solving the main problems such as evaluating the complaints in a short period to overcome the unjust treatments coordinating the relations between commercial actors and solving the problems among them removing the commercial monopoly and the improper behaviors in commercial life in ku adas determining improper behavior under the competition law and correcting them in accordance with the law creating a common telephone number for complaints and communication and displaying that number in certain places of the city establishing a related secretariat in the governorship and eliminating the unregulated elements of ku adas commercial life

7783686 the price to be paid for delta lloyds share will be determined in the near future based on the terms of the agreement
7783687 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7783688 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7783689 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7783690 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7783691 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7783692 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7783693 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7783694 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

7783701 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7783702 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7783703 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7783704 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7783705 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7783706 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7783707 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7783708 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7783709 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7783710 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7783711 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7783712 kami ingin membuat idol tahun ini makin panas dan sangat bersemangat untuk menyambut kara di meja juri

7783714 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7783715 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7783716 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7783717 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7783718 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7783719 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7783720 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

7783726 she played a very good match and i had trouble returning her serves
7783727 i had 5 2 in the second but i perhaps played a bit tight i made some bad decisions
7783728 im very disappointed obviously i just gotta take this as another step and move on
7783729 i wish there was a secret formula but there isnt
7783730 its just a matter of working hard and focusing on things you want to improve on
7783731 just playing the matches sometimes you have a bad run but you just keep going and things will get better sooner or later
7783732 inflation needed to be tackled but the task is done and now relief is required lest the landing be too hard

7783736 billions of naira have been sunk into aviation and maritime sectors to lift them up but there is nothing to show that there is a similar commitment to road transportation
7783737 more than 90 per cent of transportation is by road
7783738 that scheme was a success because the then president of the nurtw was a member of the implementation committee
7783739 the vehicles which were released to us on loan basis were well maintained and paid for because we are professionals with the vast knowledge to manage them
7783740 but by 1996 after the scheme was re launched under late gen sani abacha it collapsed because he never contacted us the professionals in that field to be part of the implementation
7783741 we have received thousands of all kinds of vehicles for our members
7783742 leaders of the region have arrived at the scene and they are handling the accident
7783743 any information related to the accident will be released by the guangxi government
7783744 i am aware he was writing a lot of articles in that magazine and was part of the publishing team
7783745 we are in talks with more big state owned banks in the bancassurance business line to boost the premium growth
7783746 she hasnt talked to anyone she just looks like your sweet little grandma and no one knows where she is
7783747 people just dont know if they are ready for the change candidate
7783748 our goal has been to reach out and tear down the walls of the convention
7783749 ive seen whats on tv and im not going to comment on it
7783750 i was unable to locate sgt bruss video we have searched everywhere for it we were in the process of changing out old cars for new cars and we couldnt find it
7783751 this makes it impossible for me to listen to how sgt bruss talked to you
7783752 the classic favorite made with our savory pizza sauce and grated part skim mozzarella cheese
7783753 we cannot keep these people if we dont pay them
7783754 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7783755 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7783756 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7783757 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7783758 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7783759 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7783760 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7783761 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7783762 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7783763 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7783764 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7783765 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7783766 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7783767 turkey is using merely 24 percent of its female workforce whereas 16 2 million males are employed only 6 1 million women are employed but more strikingly among 1 219 000 employers in turkey only 75 000 or 6 percent are women
7783768 it is impossible for such a country to join the european union we are like a boxer with one hand tied behind his back
7783769 the entrepreneurship capital for women is inadequate the small and medium industry development organization kosgeb must develop a special womens fund funds available for the manufacturing sector should be available for the service sector as well
7783770 but every day women are overcoming cultural and economic obstacles to join the economy as entrepreneurs
7783771 expecting women without access to financial resources to jump into the business life is unjust
7783772 turkey produces more than 20 million tons of waste in a year
7783773 approximately 1 2 million tons of the waste is hazardous recycled waste constitutes 8 percent of the total amount while 47 percent are disposed 45 percent are re used
7783774 in this case disposal ways of 456 359 tons of waste are unknown
7783775 the number means 93 percent of the population in municipal regions have access to drinking water
7783776 people benefiting from sewage systems constitute 72 percent of turkeys population
7783777 but it now faces the most dangerous problem in tourism which is that the district forces itself to grow because of the annuity concern
7783778 those saying we want to do something to improve tourism in safranbolu are the biggest danger for the district we are at the most dangerous level this district is not available for any addition it deserves to be preserved without being changed
7783779 the biggest deficiency of safranbolu is the visual pollution caused by buildings it endangers the districts skyline this is why we have started to revise the development plan in the district we have imposed a ban on construction in an area covering even the outside of the district we make decisions with a preservation commission no municipality can do that
7783780 what do tourists want they want to see the life of local people of a city
7783781 while restoring the houses we will set up conditions like residing in the house for a certain time
7783782 we need to introduce safranbolu to the residents of safranbolu
7783783 people in safranbolu are not aware of where they live this is the biggest deficiency but we are working against this fact
7783784 rough cobblestone pavements that have been turned into asphalt over time because of some well intentioned mistakes and fountains that have been painted should be restored first twenty buildings last year and 25 buildings this year went through restorations also projects have been prepared for about 100 buildings
7783785 we have houses but nothing more it is a big problem that we have limited products we cannot offer any other thing to tourists we need more traditional elements our souvenirs are very limited there is sameness but not fear for art
7783786 it was like a ghost city 30 years ago it was about to die but now it is more european than istanbul
7783787 safranbolu is like my lost paradise it is the only place that gives inspiration and does not make one tired i think history gifted the residents of safranbolu with houses streets mosques etc visitors of the district can travel in history also safranbolu reminds us of the concept of friendship this is why the authenticity and historical identity of safranbolu should be protected very well
7783788 you get used to it in the beginning its like coffee or wine you dont really like it but then you try it a second time to be like the adults and gradually you end up really liking it
7783789 but i dont know if it was because of the alcohol or the taste of the fish
7783790 the hardest part is going back home because of the smell my wife always makes me sleep on the sofa
7783791 we never expected these results people should get what they pay for
7783792 we really like sushi and wed take home fish samples and put them in alcohol
7783793 americans spend an estimated 70 billion per year on seafood and we think authorities should do routine dna barcoding of fish
7783794 it bears on a number of issues food safety fraud and protection of endangered species
7783795 therons movie will be screened in the festival that is why the producer and the crew will accompany her in the festival
7783796 we have made three publicity movies for the festival vildan atasever tamer krada l and ebnem d nmez performed for them
7783797 the greater you are the simpler you need to be

7783806 we have received some partnership offers from foreigners almost all the big chocolate firms around the world sent in their offers we cannot know what the time will show however we currently are not interested in those offers
7783807 our priority is to become a global brand as a turkish firm we believe in ourselves
7783808 last year we were exporting to 100 countries this year that number rose to 120
7783809 we are glad to be working with wal mart we aim to obtain 20 percent of our annual turnover from wal mart sales
7783810 each year we report a growth rate of 40 percent or higher we rank second in the domestic market
7783811 a combination of all these factors in a market driven to a large extent by debt funding has led to investment activity coming to a virtual standstill in recent months
7783812 danmarks nationalbank and the financial sector in denmark have entered into an agreement with the board of directors of roskilde bank via a new bank on buying all assets and taking over all debt and other liabilities except from hybrid core capital and subordinated loan capital in roskilde bank
7783813 every power cut even if it lasts for just a few minutes delays water production by three hours
7783814 there wasnt a lot of focus from the former regime on the long term consequences of dumping raw sewage onto river banks
7783815 we have people illegally siphoning water from the pipelines using potable water to irrigate their gardens and fill their fish pools
7783816 even water used by car washes this wasted water could be used in areas already suffering from shortages
7783817 the water is dirty but what can we do we dont have any other choice
7783818 people like us who earn three or four dollars a day we spend it all on generators
7783819 as soon as you build new plants and you lay down new networks you will be able to service more people
7783820 now they apparently have enough resources and theyre slowly moving toward using those resources
7783821 but the task is immense even with all the money in the world it would still take time

7783825 only people who disturb peoples mental security could support such a thing
7783826 one of the misunderstandings is that you try and compare the institutions of countries which are not similar to each other
7783827 most of the people i knoware in favour of reform not revolution because people are too tired to experience another revolution
7783828 certain western media best represented by cnn and bbc in the name of press freedom have been unscrupulously slandering and defaming developing nations
7783829 we use the internet mostly for entertainment sharing information earning money or other fun
7783830 bloggers have succeeded in doing something that years of standing on the street corner and shouting no to torture or no to the interior ministry has never managed to accomplish
7783831 fifty years ago saudi bedouins were riding around on camels now theyre using mobile phones and the best technology
7783832 it will take time for society to catch up with this technology
7783833 communications tools such as youtube twitter facebook and blogging dont get socially interesting until they get technologically boring
7783834 blogging has allowed us as bahrainis to breathe some fresh air as a blogger you feel that you are helping your country
7783835 i wanted to create a website where people inside and outside bahrain could communicate and exchange information
7783836 people are seeing the mistakes of the government and they want to freely discuss them
7783837 blogs are very effective because the society is highly politicized and a lot of people are internet users

7783845 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7783846 if you voted for me you have to know you would be more comfortable with the positions i took with barack obama than john mccain
7783847 there are a lot of democrats here who are not ready to vote for barack obama because they dont think hes ready to be president and they are looking very hard at john mccain
7783848 some of the clinton supporters feel she was disenfranchised bitter
7783849 some people will hold back support but i think they have to realize we have to come together and take on mccain hes the real enemy not each other
7783850 the caucasus has always been and will remain the zone of russias strategic interests

7783874 we are very excited at the prospects for the combined company
7783875 the completion of this transaction advances one of the key elements of our strategy building scale and scope through opportunistic investments to complement hudbays existing operations
7783876 hudbays attractive mix of producing development and exploration assets provide a solid platform for future growth

7783882 we would like to take this opportunity to thank mr swinoga for his contributions to hudbay over the last few years and we wish him all the best in his future endeavours
7783883 i would say some people thought we were going to die that is how frightening it was the woman sitting in the seats in front of us was whimpering
7783884 i knew it wasnt an engine problem there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold
7783885 the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping my highest priority was to get a mask on to my son who was sitting next to me in a bemused and frightened state we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft as we landed we saw fire engines every quarter of a mile down the runway
7783886 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons
7783887 from where i was sitting i could see about 20 masks and only a few of them were inflating
7783888 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
7783889 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
7783890 the first thing we do in these situations is divert to safety take the safety first option
7783891 we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew also deploy their oxygen masks they cant be making passenger pa announcements when they have their oxygen masks on as the passengers confirmed the pilot did make an announcement once he got down to 8 000ft where it is safe to take the oxygen masks off that they were diverting to limoges

7783893 as a party we are contesting the legitimacy of mr mugabe but since we are now in control of parliament that has to be put into perspective
7783894 relations between mutambara and mugabe have been good lately its not inconceivable that the two agreed to work together in an attempt to retain control of parliament
7783895 the fact that the mdc won despite these tactics is certainly an important psychological victory for them and a big blow for mugabe

7783915 im feeling really confident just now regardless of what happened in beijing
7783916 i feel im hitting the ball well i feel mentally strong and physically im not tired so i want to do well here and today was a good start
7783917 i think before you get out on the court there is always maybe more nerves in the first round maybe by the second third fourth rounds you get used to the court
7783918 no one wants to go out in the first round but actually once you get onto the court and you play sort of four five six games you get more comfortable and you relax a little bit
7783919 i was lucky i got off to a good start and calmed down a little bit after that
7783920 i play for myself and i work really hard off the court to try and get the rewards in these tournaments
7783921 in the past i felt nervous coming into the bigger tournaments but now that ive started to work really hard off the court you go into the matches with sort of no excuses no worries
7783922 you just go on the court and just to play tennis and thats one of the few things that im good at its worked out much better for me this year
7783923 i spent about four or five weeks out in florida training
7783924 that means being away from your family for obviously that period of time when you could be at home training in really hot conditions and going in the gym a couple of times a day its a complete waste of time going on the court and finding reasons why you might lose the match and what have you
7783925 you just go out there and fight for every single point because thats a complete waste of time putting the work in if youre not going to use it out on the court
7783926 and its really been the first time early this year when i felt really good going on the court physically and its nice to sort of show that youre in great shape because i think it sends a message to the other players

7783935 the wild cats of today such as lions and tigers descended from early carnivores called miacids from there the modern wild cat developed into three main types the european wild cat the african wild cat and the asiatic desert cat the domestic cat is thought to have evolved from the african wild cat because of its tabby markings domestic cats today still take many characteristics from their wild ancestors the arresting eyes body shape feeding and grooming habits are the same along with the ability to pounce into action at any given moment it is this link that makes the domestic cat so fascinating around the world

7783990 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
7783991 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
7783992 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
7783993 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
7783994 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
7783995 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
7783996 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
7783997 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
7783998 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
7783999 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

7784017 nal publishes erotic romance under our eclipse and heat imprints we look for strong talented voices writing high concept books eclipse erotic romances are very sexy but have developed relationships and a happy ending heat books focus more on the sex than the relationship development these books should have intriguing premises were looking for contemporary historical and paranormal erotica
7784018 what i look for first and foremost is a believable plot and characters i can connect with even though many elements in paranormal romances are out of this world the author has to do a great job at making it seem as real as possible while creating a complex plot without losing sight of the love between the hero and heroine a writer wants to make the readers believe whats going on in the story even if it seems outrageous this is usually best done with characters who have traits that readers can empathize with and connect to evoking the five senses is a plus as well

7784023 characterization is also very important the hero and heroine must
7784024 a good romance cannot be compelling without conflict and this conflict
7784025 finally it can be difficult to say the least to come up with a totally new idea for a romance novel and still have it fit within the parameters of your targeted line but your approach still needs to be fresh and hopefully your story will at least have a new twist something that makes it stand out from the crowd

7784095 shes been banging around for years and finally got her shot im so excited
7784096 i think she looks so beautiful right now im really happy for her she looks amazing and she better win the vma shes the best
7784097 i dont want to go up to green bay and have the risk of having a setback or pushing an injury just to get on the field to hit a couple balls where if i have that extra week and a half of rest thatll put me that much further ahead
7784098 thats what im wanting to do and im sure thats what the coaches want to do
7784099 the thing that he did last year its kind of funny because he did miss a couple short field goals
7784100 ive been doing everything i can to keep the rest of my body in shape and just let this injury heal
7784101 i think its good to go back out there so we can just wash that out of our memory
7784102 were going to let them leave it in their mouth as long as they can
7784103 i thought we looked like a bunch of drunken cowpokes trying to do a texas two step with one leg it was ugly
7784104 obviously were upset about it but ill tell you one thing it may happen to us once but its not going to happen to us twice we wont allow it buges wont allow it and thats not something were going to make a tradition
7784105 thats something i learned in elementary school way back when tight hands win and i didnt do that on that one particular play and he took advantage of it

7784108 anton is up this morning for a medical were looking to tie it up today
7784109 i met him last week and it went well he will be a good addition to our squad and it will keep people on their toes
7784110 i will be delighted if i can get him and another one and then we can concentrate on the season
7784111 hes had a slight hamstring strain so it would be unfair to throw him straight in
7784112 there is an international break coming up so it would give him a chance to train with us for two weeks
7784113 donncha oconnor intimated to us yesterday that he would like to appeal the decision whenever a player wants to appeal a decision we stand by our players and help them to fight their case we have always done that in the past and i think it is the same in every county you have to stand by your players
7784114 all credit to darren he has given himself a great chance
7784115 i feel that i have to win at gleneagles now at the johnnie walker championship if im to give myself a chance of a pick
7784116 faldo has a lot of options and it will be interesting to see where he goes i wont be part of the decision making process and im so glad im not part of that process i dont feel it is right as a competitive player to be a part of that
7784117 i have justified my reason for standing down as vice captain by giving myself a chance of a pick setanta readers comment of the day
7784118 he has had an x ray and there was no fracture but it looks a nasty one
7784119 i dont know yet how long he will be out but i think he will be missing for some time
7784120 its so crazy that it came so fast its incredible
7784121 it seems like just yesterday we were getting off that plane coming home from the loss against lsu and now were here and ready to begin a new era and a new season
7784122 were getting pretty eager you could tell toward the last week of camp that guys are on edge theres a little more talking a little more chirping and were ready to play somebody else other than ourselves
7784123 todd boeckman has great command of what were trying to do
7784124 its fun to watch him in practice he has a thorough understanding of what were doing it is great to have that type of comfort zone at your quarterback position you always love going into a season with a veteran quarterback
7784125 the big thing that jumps out at me is timing because timing comes with experience
7784126 any time were on the field and weve been in a position weve seen before we can come back in to the huddle and its real easy
7784127 were definitely on the same page were kind of at the point where we know what hes thinking
7784128 theres more of a connection there theres more of a chemistry we feel a lot more comfortable
7784129 i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming
7784130 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
7784131 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7784132 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7784133 scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves
7784134 i think hes put himself in a pretty good position for that
7784135 were not naming a starter at this point but i think q is making a pretty good statement at this point for playing time at that position
7784136 i saw a couple of guys packing up bags and i thought yes i didnt get that phone call at the holiday inn
7784137 i was coming in this year focused on special teams but when they let chillar go i figured i might have a good chance of playing a lot if they didnt bring anyone in to play the position
7784138 just because your whole life youve experienced nothing but war doesnt mean you can stop living
7784139 these women are really the radicals because not only are they getting outside their home and doing something theyre doing sports
7784140 we cannot lose hope sit at home and never do anything stop going to school stop playing we cannot do that life doesnt go on like that we have to play we have to hope
7784141 it was encouraging for them to see that they can push these girls and get more out of them and that just because theyre girls they dont have to be quite as easy on them
7784142 when we play basketball its more than just basketball its learning valuable life skills and i know that you take some risks in doing what you do but dont ever fear the risks go for the opportunity to learn and to become strong young women
7784143 those guys will be guys that we want to see x number of snaps from just because they havent had as many plays as some of the other players have had
7784144 it was a little frustrating because i thought i had a pretty good week of practice and i prepared like i was going to play the game
7784145 but coach paytons job is to make sure every player is 100 percent that was his decision and i respect it its something as a player you want to play but i think hes looking at the best interest of the player
7784146 he is a great talent young american got a lot of potential
7784147 i hope my experience will be a little more valuable than his potential at this point i think hes a name that will be a household name hopefully in a couple of years i hope he doesnt make it a household name this time
7784148 i believe in the mid 80s there was a problem where no one thought there were no good u s mens players but then in three or four years you had jim courier agassi sampras and michael chang that wasnt a bad group theres no question its a weak cycle right now but im sure that will change
7784149 i dont know that roddick and blake are coming up they are already established players
7784150 you have to start looking at 14 and 16 year olds who could possibly be the next agassi sampras or courier
7784151 agassi and sampras were incredible champions won many grand slams and were no 1 in the world respectively
7784152 its very difficult to take over the mantle roddick and blake are doing the best they can andy won a grand slam before but obviously to follow in the footsteps of agassi and sampras are very difficult
7784153 i think i help a little bit to play to his level
7784154 sure hes a good player he played well today but i didnt play with normal intensity probably im a little bit tired more than usual
7784155 i talked to them about man this is game week
7784156 this is why you play football if you cant get excited about game week then youre in the wrong business
7784157 i really didnt give them a chance to show me what they had as much as i wanted to explain what this was all about and how excited they should be
7784158 well play it by ear he hasnt been cleared to do a whole heck of a lot so i have some concern there
7784159 theyre making progress theyre going to take game experience to get to the level we need to get
7784160 well find out about that group once we get into the ball game
7784161 weve got a long way to go and were not there yet
7784162 there is a lot of quality depth there which is important for us especially early in the season
7784163 were going to need every single one of those guys
7784164 you be ok youll be fine just relax just relax
7784165 ok stand up grab my arm lean on me just lean on me
7784166 i am up for the ass out of a dead rhinoceros

7784169 so youre sick and tired of being served by your domme jeez being waited on and waited on hand and foot foot and hand by your sovereign queen please no more
7784170 ok alright the bitch from hell now rides into town you will make the salad or suffer the consequences
7784171 is two weeks too much i can only handle monotone for so long anyway and i am not trying to be your job
7784172 two weeks is fine and i think you are one of my jobs but 24 7 has to be temporary i just wanted to make sure that you understood that
7784173 but for now you are merely an extension of my will you are because i think so
7784174 id ask you what youre holding behind your back but im afraid ill eventually find out
7784175 if you feel weak or dizzy like youre about to pass out or anything like that then tell me if you let me really hurt you ill have the guilts for i dont know how long and youll get the prize for shittest slave the safeword is for my safety
7784176 what is that bulge curious minds well one curious mind
7784177 its nineteen fifty and youre pregnant you are in the stirrups and i am in the saddle wider
7784178 why are you letting me hit you in the nuts with a riding crop
7784179 because your joy gives me more pleasure than the whip gives pain
7784180 always splurge for quality and unique pieces that have longevity
7784181 shop for value keeping in mind you want to build on your wardobe as opposed to indulging in disposable fashion that only lasts one season
7784182 they give the illusion that i am long and lean and superslim
7784183 its one of the pieces that has been in my closet for a long time

7784191 im always particularly interested in the motives of a suspense novels
7784192 pacing is also important and finding the most suspenseful resonant
7784193 finally a unique and dynamic protagonist certainly draws me in as does a well drawn cast of secondary characters
7784194 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
7784195 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce

7784208 if ever i see you with a sweeping brush in your hands i swear i will kill you
7784209 over the past few years ive had an uncomfortable sense that someone or something has been tinkering with my brain remapping the neural circuitry reprogramming the memory im not thinking the way i used to think i can feel it most strongly when im reading immersing myself in a book or lengthy article used to be easy my mind would get caught up in the narrative or the turns of the argument and id spend hours strolling through long stretches of prose thats rarely the case anymore now my concentration often starts to drift after two or three pages the deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle
7784210 my mind now expects to take in information the way the net distributes it in a swiftly moving stream of particles
7784211 our ability to interpret text to make the rich mental connections that form when we read deeply and without distraction remains largely disengaged

7784224 the savings they will get doing away with lunch in business class they will lose more than that when corporations yank business the challenging thing about business is that whether things are good or bad you have to invest in your product for the sake of keeping customers and to make it harder for competitors to catch up with you this does nothing to encourage people to pay more because you give more they really make me question whether the inmates have taken control of the asylum

7784351 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7784352 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7784353 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

7784357 im not sure all of these towns have an ability to cope and provide the crisis intervention
7784358 its a different community than when i was growing up for sure
7784359 we have zero tolerance for employing people who are not authorized to work in the u s and use all available tools provided by the u s government to verify the documents of the people we hire
7784360 you can see that people are more scared in general
7784361 some of them they dont even tell you directly but people dont go outside like they used to and things like that

7784376 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia

7784381 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
7784382 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
7784383 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
7784384 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido

7784390 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
7784391 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7784392 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7784393 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

7784601 to be effective storage wells must be able to maintain stable leak free conditions for hundreds of years
7784602 the pecten high has already yielded in excess of 1 7 trillion cubic feet of gas
7784603 by comparison the central part of the discovery bay high hosts a similar prospect and lead inventory to the pecten high ranging from small accumulations onshore to very large continental margins plays offshore
7784604 this makes for a compelling exploration play fairway offshore from portland
7784605 our expectations for this province have delivered a very early return with essentials east wing gas discovery in june in the pecten high
7784606 this onshore well intersected 46 metres of hydrocarbon zones and will be production tested from this saturday for both oil and gas potential
7784607 a sustainable oil flow from east wing will be a first step in changing the view of the otway basin as being a gas only basin
7784608 oil is trading in a very volatile wide range the volatility is telling me that a base is trying to form
7784609 we are waiting for it we have submitted the bid our bid is very competitive it will take 2 3 days maybe next week you will hear something

7784612 a portion of mankind may be said to constitute a nationality if they are united among themselves by common sympathies which do not exist between them and any others which make them co operate with each other more willingly than with other people desire to be under the same government and desire that it should be government by themselves or a portion of themselves exclusively this feeling of nationality may have been generated by various causes sometimes it is the effect of identity of race and descent community of language and community of religion greatly contribute to it geographical limits are one of its causes but the strongest of all is identity of political antecedents the possession of a national history and consequent community of recollections collective pride and humiliation pleasure and regret connected with the same incidents in the past none of these circumstances however are either indispensable or necessarily sufficient by themselves
7784613 i on the other hand dont at all believe in nationalism or self determination so i am relaxed about where poles live

7784618 it would be a big mistake if the us believes that it can carry out a search of our home as it did in iraq as it pleased
7784619 when the six party talks have degenerated into a circus where the strong bullies the weak as it pleases whats the use of the six party structure
7784620 verification is a duty to be carried out by every party that should come at the last stage of the denuclearisation of the whole korean peninsula
7784621 has been pressing us to accept inspections in which they may visit wherever they want collect samples and take measurements as they please
7784622 in breach of our sovereignty and which subsequently caused us to leave the nuclear non proliferation treaty
7784623 the us is making a robber like demand that it will carry out unilateral inspections of us throwing away the denuclearisation of the korean peninsula in which the removal of the us nuclear threat is at the centre
7784624 internally we recognized that our discerning customers both individuals as well as commercial establishments would appreciate a music system that would offer the same exceptional sound quality as the model d music system but would be ideal for more intimate listening spaces
7784625 in specific cases existing owners of our model d music system also expressed their desire to acquire additional systems that encapsulate the dna of the model d but that would fit perfectly into more intimate living spaces such as their bedrooms or dining rooms the model c is created to fulfill precisely this need while adhering to all of our uncompromising core values

7784661 we like to say its convenience and conscience wrapped up in a green ribbon
7784662 parents are all time starved now and echoage is a convenient service because you dont have to drive around shop for a gift and then wrap it
7784663 people want to empower their children to think about the planet and to be conscious of how many gifts theyre buying

7784689 there are some kids whose eyes sparkle and you can see that for them this is like brain candy
7784690 often around the age of 14 and 15 and then again around 17
7784691 we find them doing a lot of soul searching about whether this really is the profession that they want

7784769 under todays system public transport and the non public transport are two separate sectors so those who take public transport make use of ez link card and those who drive for erp make use of nets cashcard
7784770 going forward we want to develop a system whereby one card can be used across all the systems which means transit and non transit also we want to introduce competition so hopefully bring down the cost for commuters
7784771 all these are commercial decisions to be made by the card issuers so if they want to compete in the market and they want to ensure that their cards are widely used for all sectors then i think they have to build up their business model

7784887 there is always fear of something like this but with these raids we know now its real
7784888 these raids have really highlighted the difficulties towns face in this situation
7784889 im not sure all of these towns have an ability to cope and provide the crisis intervention
7784890 its a different community than when i was growing up for sure
7784891 we have zero tolerance for employing people who are not authorized to work in the u s and use all available tools provided by the u s government to verify the documents of the people we hire
7784892 you can see that people are more scared in general
7784893 some of them they dont even tell you directly but people dont go outside like they used to and things like that
7784894 it would be a huge hit to our community culturally economically our businesses our people a huge hit

7784906 we are now controlling most of the key government offices to prevent them from coming to work
7784907 today we declare a long long holiday for the government
7784908 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
7784909 but there is some stuff ive got to do in the next four days ive got to straighten some things out
7784910 i have every reason to believe that the intelligence we were operating off was correct and that we will in fact find weapons or evidence of weapons programs that are conclusive

7784918 according to my knowledge settlement activity is reduced in the most dramatic way especially in the parts on the other side of the fence barrier
7784919 i think that is no secret and i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think the settlement activity is helpful to the peace process

7784921 our position is that this country does not have a state president
7784922 there are people in this area who still havent sold all their rice
7784923 they kept waiting for the price to rise but instead it went down
7784924 with vietnams high rate of inflation banks interest rates are at 20 per cent
7784925 so exporters will only buy rice if they have contracts and can export it within one to two months
7784926 at these prices i dont think ill make any profit at all on the autumn crop
7784927 the government order is very vague so it doesnt have any effect
7784928 they dont set a price they just say 40 per cent profit but who decides what 40 per cent is
7784929 the price rose for only three or four days and then it began to fall again probably because the supply exceeds the demand
7784930 many farmers slowed their rice sales after they found out about the governments efforts to encourage rice trading firms to buy more rice
7784931 i think overall the trend of the market is bearish right now but the hurricane premium as well as the russia nato premium is whats keeping the market from dropping further

7784938 ik moet toegeven dat ik nu veel meer moeite heb met onrecht en onveiligheid soms kan ik de verhalen gewoon niet aanhoren dan word ik te emotioneel geraakt

7784972 in not more than a week two genocide survivors have been murdered the problem is up to now they are still dying which makes it serious everyone has to help and ensure severe punishment for those involved in the killings
7784973 security bodies are doing their work what is remaining is for those in charge of punishing the criminals if arrested they should be punished in order to discourage others with similar ideas
7784974 it might discourage witnesses because it has a psychological effect if the murder is a result of being a witness people might not want to witness
7784975 who could have thought that the problem of refugees which had been rampant for decades would become history all this was championed by the rpf

7784978 using public funds or public means for some candidates is a kind of injustice for other candidates who dont have the possibility to use them

7784988 i mean dont you think you havent got enough life experience havent
7784989 the priesthood isnt about how old you are its about serving others my life experience or lack thereof is irrelevant and i resent the implication that younger people dont suffer
7784990 dont you think youre too young to be a priest dont you think you havent got enough life experience havent suffered enough
7784991 you know you might be right i am young and i dont have much life experience at least compared to the other people youve been seeing today but i trust that god will help me to be present to people when they are suffering and need someone to be there i hope that whatever reserves of suffering and life experience i have will be sufficient in those times and if they arent that god will work effectively through me despite my obvious deficits
7784992 as for my youth from what i can tell time will take care of that and ive come to believe that i wont have to seek out suffering if im a priest suffering will find me whether i like it or not

7785002 our work has shown that its education and social status not social class that predict cultural consumption in the uk and broadly comparable results were obtained from other countries in our project too
7785003 furthermore at least a substantial minority of members of the most advantaged social groups are univores or inactives
7785004 are educated people really more open more tolerant more liberated more enlightened because they indicate having wider tastes in questionnaires we should not confuse knowledge and open mindedness

7785008 the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping my highest priority was to get a mask on to my son who was sitting next to me in a bemused and frightened state we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft as we landed we saw fire engines every quarter of a mile down the runway
7785009 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons
7785010 from where i was sitting i could see about 20 masks and only a few of them were inflating
7785011 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
7785012 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
7785013 the first thing we do in these situations is divert to safety take the safety first option
7785014 we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew also deploy their oxygen masks they cant be making passenger pa announcements when they have their oxygen masks on as the passengers confirmed the pilot did make an announcement once he got down to 8 000ft where it is safe to take the oxygen masks off that they were diverting to limoges
7785015 ryanair confirms that the fr9336 from bristol airport to barcelona girona airport on the evening of august 25 experienced an inflight depressurisation incident which caused the oxygen masks on board to deploy all 168 passengers disembarked safely upon landing a total of 16 passengers together with five accompanying family members have transferred at their request to a local hospital complaining of earache

7785018 watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it

7785108 we are bolstering our position as north american leader in the realm of renewable energy
7785109 quebec has opted for renewable energy and rec silicon has acknowledged this leadership by choosing quebec
7785110 power prices are important but thats a big investment im sure there are other sweeteners
7785111 nothing that is not available to the industry in general
7785112 theres too much of an incrementalist approach to renewables in ontario
7785113 the stocks of these companies are highly dependent on natural gas prices and shareholder acceptance of this deal will be predicated on what the valuations look like depending on how that changes
7785114 none of us are basing this deal on the price of gas in august
7785115 long term were very bullish on the tightness of the gas supply and despite some relatively good response in the last few months on natural gas drilling in the u s unconventional gas has very aggressive decline rates
7785116 i think the key here of course is that the retail banking operations of these banks at least remain stable because that to me is the backbone of these banks
7785117 a lot of the problems that have occurred have been more on the investment banking side and so retail banking is going to be something which should be focused on

7785121 rains have certainly hurt the harvest on the wheat crop in terms of quality rendered probably some of it unsuitable for milling

7785127 how many opportunities have slipped through your fingers because you didnt act on them and what could have you done that would have improved your life beyond imagining but you didnt get round to
7785128 perhaps it was because i hadnt had any sweets or sugar so go and make a cup of tea first

7785132 the smart is a surprisingly comfortable ride even if it isnt exactly a thrill to pilot high seats and broad visibility help you feel less intimidated by the other larger cars on the road which is pretty much all of them despite the cars low weight the engine still feels underpowered especially in automatic mode i preferred the tip tronic manual which lets you rev the engine a little higher to kick up a decent amount of torque if you have the kind of urban hipster persona that can make a vespa work as your primary means of shuttling around town you could certainly consider the smart a strong alternative
7785133 wow i couldnt believe the difference in perceived size when youre observing at the car it looks like an over size tonka model and when youre inside it feels like a regular compact car leg space wasnt an issue at all and i soon forgot about the lack of rear protection once we were zipping around country roads with the top down out of sight out of mind i guess but would i feel safe on a highway next to an 18 wheeler no
7785134 i was expecting a car that size to cut down on everything but it felt like i was riding in any other sedan when it came to space between me and the passenger maybe thats why i didnt feel unsafe while driving it im not sure what i would think about a guy driving this car i would be intrigued to find out more about a guy who buys one of these why did he do it is this his only means of transportation is he making a statement about transportation in our society i know what people say about guys who compensate for things and buy large cars but what do they say about guys in small ones
7785135 sometimes smaller is better this is not one of those times i was looking forward to slipping behind the wheel of the smart fortwo certain that the car would be a hell of a lot of fun to drive that for me was enough to build my anticipation but then i drove it and discovered that despite decent power and cornering ability the smart isnt very much fun to drive but if the company figures out a way to tweak 50 miles per gallon from the 1 0 liter engine and drops the price to 8 000 theyll sell a million of them here and ill be at the front of the line
7785136 its outrageous that our tax dollars are inflating executive paycheques

7785148 so many of the times i called him to seek his advice had to do with personnel issues he was so good with that his counsel was always to be kind to people and treat them the way you wanted to be treated

7785159 i am sure we will dig our lot on monday tuesday and wednesday but unfortunately the knock out hits have already been served whatever way we skin the cat here we didnt start well and we didnt finish well
7785160 we started the season off really well getting lots of points and being bloody reliable and things were going our way then it all started at the hockenheim test and we have struggled since then we havent been competitive in any session anywhere or any race
7785161 we are on the limit in qualifying to get through to q3 and with a tenth we could have gone through but we would still have got smashed in the race
7785162 im no no 2 whoever you put me next to even michael schumacher
7785163 last year i meant business i was there to tell the world i wasnt half a second slower than fernando alonso as some people predicted
7785164 i was thinking hang on im no no 2 whoever you put me next to even michael schumacher i was there to prove how good i was which i did but this year i want to top that my sole focus is to win the world championship
7785165 i dont know if you can see but i feel a lot stronger than i was this time last year i think it is just maturity knowing what you need
7785166 last year i would have been at this race in valencia and i would have just driven my heart out not really knowing not really thinking exactly why i just wanted to win and was not thinking how the points were going to work

7785169 damage control and financial minimization at a time like this has not even been considered
7785170 as an investor that may not be what you want to hear but 100 per cent of our focus over the weekend has been to identify to our customers the roughly 220 products were recalling to make sure theyre returned to us for disposal
7785171 from what ive seen theyre doing an exemplary job so far
7785172 they have been forthright and open theyve had a major recall theyre sanitizing the plant theyd have to do that anyway but the fact theyve got hold of this so quickly and really taken the initiative is very important
7785173 i think theres a recognition in the food industry in particular that a really small problem can take down your entire company unless youre seen to be really fast and thorough and open and communicative
7785174 the big question is if your parents are in a nursing home what are they the nursing home going to do
7785175 i put it the shares on hold last week just because i didnt know what the future holds and i still dont know as far as sales are concerned
7785176 some may be able to offer longer hours on four days of the week and potentially improve the access to patients
7785177 it wont damage the building or contents but it will make it uncomfortable
7785178 using someone elses infrastructure for your application will forever be a business risk but it sounds so much less so with a cuddly name your cto will fall for the next cycle pretty easily the compunction he feels for his latest data center build out will outweigh the downsides of an external dependency

7785225 in the shorter term a dramatic downturn in consumer confidence fuelled and sustained by the credit crunch and exacerbated by rising food and fuel prices has had serious effects on the uk beer and pubs market
7785226 in particular the shift in drinking habits from pubs to drinking at home has accelerated the impact of the smoking ban is working its way through the system and an exceptional duty increase has contributed towards making the purchase of alcohol in the on trade prohibitively expensive for some drinkers
7785227 beer sales are currently the weakest part of the pub trade and as adnams sells in excess of 90 of its beer outside of its own pubs it is exposed to current conditions to a much greater extent than regional breweries owning large tied estates

7785245 without naming names i do want to make the point that the 2003 world cup coaching team effectively left no legacy to the english game
7785246 as a result the elite end of the sport in this country was in a terrible state
7785247 we think in three to four years time although there are good reasons why it should be 2010 already but well see
7785248 the first person in the world who talked about the chip issue was me
7785249 i issued a press release with a 200 million dollar reserve and in fact our customers were saying jen hsun why did you do that
7785250 the logic is impeccable we know that there are some failures that are associated with our chips we know that its related to specific combination of the chip and the design of the notebook
7785251 most of the notebooks are fine my notebook is fine
7785252 i go to the oem and tell the oem lets fix that no questions asked lets just go solve it in fact ill put a reserve in place so that if you were to solve it ill pay you back
7785253 now i just sold a chip for 20 and i might have to spend 200 to help repair a notebook just think about that for a second nobody has ever done that before
7785254 i just dont want the consumers to have to fight the process
7785255 its a little bit messy because the competition wants to stir it up and there are people who want to stir it up but its not really that complicated in the end
7785256 were seeing a higher than what we would like to see failure rate but if the consumer has a failure to report i can get it fixed right away
7785257 we use an industry standard process how we manufacture the chip is identical to a lot of companies and this particular bump underfill material has been used to manufacture billions and billions of chips not billions of chips
7785258 its just theres a happy circumstance or unhappy circumstance that just happens to be exactly right on power thermal and just happened to hit that spot
7785259 ultimately the way i look at it is theres nobody to blame
7785260 im going to stand up and be partly responsible and the oems obviously were working with they feel that because its their notebooks theyre partly responsible if anybody else volunteers to be responsible im happy to let them be part of that but i dont need to wait for anybody else
7785261 youre here to learn and focus on education youre going to have to confirm to a standardized code of dress in the real world so we might as well start now they can dress like they want to on the weekend or after school
7785262 i cannot find shirts for girls with three buttons and no logos
7785263 i dont blame the school i blame her mom for letting her walk out like that
7785264 im going to be totally hot if i have to come up to school and get my girls out of school for a button

7785280 her people have to be deeply worried by these returns
7785281 we said all along that we had a lot of work to do and that we werent taking anything for granted
7785282 were still viewing it like that we havent changed our game plan
7785283 the obama wave is also there and were confident that that will have an impact in this state
7785284 for months democrats have tried to say this race wont be close
7785285 the polls have been saying otherwise the primary results just confirmed that its dead even again
7785286 youre going to have a ton of young voters who will come out and vote for obama and no one else on the ticket
7785287 even though nationally it looks like this going to be a very strong democratic year both rossi and mccain seem like theyd be able to overtake those national odds for whatever reason
7785288 that doesnt mean theyll win but both of them are quite competitive in a year when their party has a lot of disadvantages

7785451 the holy koran the governing text of human life propagation of islam and jihad in the cause of islam
7785452 true to its ideological mooring in the 80s simi produced eyecatching stickers proclaiming
7785453 it was unable to function in any manner because all its members were demoralised or had crossed the age of 30 years which automatically disentitled them to continue as a member of simi and due to lack of offices and as all its accounts were frozen some of the erstwhile members also had to fight criminal cases foisted against them by the state

7785455 theres no question that it made the south more conservative the democrats not contesting the south
7785456 you know when i came to georgia in the 1980s overwhelmingly the georgia congressional delegation was democratic the governor was democratic and the legislature was democratic and they were not right wing democrats some of them were very progressive i think what happened is when the republicans played their race card in the south the democrats abandoned the south and as a result the south became more and more conservative because the democrats were not contesting the south that was and is a terrible mistake
7785457 the other thing that happened is that unions pulled out of the south basically concluding you could not win
7785458 that was not our experience in the 80s and 90s unions started putting their resources into places that were easier so the result is that half the union membership in america is concentrated in six states thats not a good situation because it really corrals our effect on american society
7785459 in the early 70s when i went there the south was a place where the perception or label was that you could not organize was not what i found
7785460 but workers are not anti union in the south employers in the south are the press politicians and employers but not workers i found that workers if they felt like there was a way to win that they would fight
7785461 southern employers in the 70s 80s and even 90s were more willing to divide workers by playing the race card than they were in the north
7785462 lifes more complicated now in the south i think people are less susceptible to that youve got immigrants youve got latinos youve got asians in our plant in atlanta youve got all kinds of african and asian immigrants its not as simple for the companies to divide the workers

7785511 e stata una vera emozione dice nocerino a ilpalermocalcio it allenarmi per la prima volta con i miei nuovi compagni sono stato accolto benissimo ed in pochi minuti ho capito di avere di fronte tutti bravi ragazzi oltre che grandi campioni ho notato anche tantissima allegria allinterno dello spogliatoio adesso devo inserirmi nei meccanismi della squadra e non vedo lora di giocare una partita ufficiale con la maglia del palermo ho accettato con tanto entusiasmo la proposta del club rosanero e sono qu a disposizione del mister
7785512 e stata una partita sfortunata abbiamo giocato bene ma non siamo riusciti a finalizzare le occasioni da gol non sempre continua nocerino nel calcio riesci a fare quello che hai preparato durante la settimana e poi le partite di agosto sono sempre ricche di sorprese tuttavia il palermo unottima squadra bisogner avere pazienza e tranquillit perch stato cambiato molto rispetto allo scorso campionato solo con gli allenamenti quotidiani si potr trovare lamalgama e la giusta condizione
7785513 partecipare ai giochi olimpici stata unesperienza straordinaria che difficilmente potr dimenticare peccato per leliminazione che certamente non meritevamo sono stati giorni intensi e nello stesso tempo bellissimi il palermo lo seguivo a distanza al termine degli allenamenti correvo in camera e attraverso internet cercavo notizie sulla mia squadra mi sarebbe piaciuto partecipare alla preparazione estiva ma pechino stata davvero importante per me da ieri conclude nocerino partita una nuova avventura ed il mio impegno sar solo per il palermo

7785524 it is between michael and the club but in an ideal world we would all like his contract sorted out sooner rather than later

7785721 suppliers require between 30 to 90 days customer termination notice to switch contract many businesses dont realise this and are leaving it too late to find a more competitive alternative energy prices have increased by more than 100 over the past year alone and are still on the rise there is a clear financial imperative to test the market in an attempt to mitigate cost increases
7785722 some businesses are panicked by the prospect of terminating their contract in the belief that their supply will be prematurely cut off we would advise them to serve notice while they consider their options even if the best deal at the end of the day is to re contract with their existing supplier at least this gives them the time to test the market without fear of being locked into an uncompetitive contract

7785777 lufficializzazione della candidatura della santanche alla carica di segretario del nostro movimento deve essere interpretata ed analizzata con la massima serieta e evidente come molto bene espresso dal coordinatore nazionale di fi denis verdini che il pdl non intende verificare la possibilita di costruire alleanze con la destra ma persegue esclusivamente una logica di annessione altrettanto evidente e che francesco storace rappresenta un ostacolo a questa strategia nella convinzione di non voler affogare nel partito del pensiero unico unarea di consenso che ritiene fondamentale lesistenza di un movimento che rappresenti la destra comunitaria sociale e popolare e tra laltro molto piu vasta di quella rappresentata dal dato elettorale
7785778 da qui nasce allora la tele guidata candidatura della santanche che non in nome di un progetto tatticamente e strategicamente alternativo a quello di storace ma rispondendo supinamente ad ordini superiori sottolinea ancora lesponente ligura del movimento di storace si presenta come liquidatrice della destra italiana comprendiamo che il logorio di andreottiana memoria strugga la quotidianita della santanche ma si dovra scontrare duramente con chi non e disposto a cancellare storia valori e progetti tra laltro poco originale e il tentativo della santanche plagiando chi questo percorso lo ha gia compiuto con successo e che risponde al nome di gianfranco fini
7785779 la destra e fatta ne abbia consapevolezza la santanche di donne e uomini verticali e sempre parafrasando detti che si sono dimostrati solo ad effetto con veri attributi chi come e con la santanche desidera tornare con il capo cosparso di cenere nel mondo orizzontale e di velluto lo faccia senza disturbare ma se per pagar pedaggio vorranno cimentarsi sappiano avverte mammi che il congresso della destra sara unarena dove sara facile per i leoni avere la meglio su tremanti servi francesco storace guidera la destra nelle future ed impegnative sfide una destra finalmente libera da fastidiosi intrusi

7785827 before a single bomb was ever dropped some of us formerly called the anti american and unpatriotic have questioned or opposed this war
7785828 thirty nine thousand bombs later no weapons of mass destruction uncovered no dangerous dictators captured no connection to september 11th
7785829 but what have we lost we have lost the lives of over 300 americans approximately two u s troop deaths each day 193 deaths since the war was declared over in total an estimated 20 000 people have died thus far in this conflict
7785830 in addition to the lives given for this effort our nation has suffered the loss of respect within the world community particularly the united nations
7785831 this nation was founded to enable freedom and diversity of opinion and many lives have been lost to secure that liberty paradoxically some still resist the open mindedness that is the very foundation of this country

7785833 its time for the democratic party to take a strong stand and call for the repeal of the patriot act
7785834 its time for our party to show some backbone its time to stand for the repeal of the patriot act as a member of the u s house of representatives i spoke against it i voted against it and i introduced legislation for its repeal
7785835 in campaigning across america its unmistakably clear that there is an almost universal rejection of the patriot act
7785836 democrats can strengthen the partys commitment to basic civil liberties by standing for the repeal of the patriot act and by blocking the governments attempt to continue pursuing a policy of unreasonable search and seizure of snooping into the private lives of our citizens and of violating our constitutional rights and freedoms
7785837 the patriot act was passed in a climate of fear fear and democracy are inconsistent it is wrong for the united states government to ask our citizens to defend our country and then to ignore and violate the very rights we are called upon to defend
7785838 in campaigning across america its unmistakably clear that there is an almost universal rejection of the patriot act

7785843 the quarterback competition will be on going throughout fall camp as the coaches are alternating snaps between nick sheridan and steven threet with the top two groups true freshman justin feagin has been getting the majority of the snaps with the third group
7785844 today friday was probably the best day of practice for our quarterbacks said rich rodriguez
7785845 offensive coordinator calvin magee commented that the most intriguing and interesting aspect of camp is the play of the tight ends the competition has been fierce with the return of mike massey from injury returning starter carson butler and the mix of young tight ends
7785846 butler is the only wolverine to earn player of the day twice thus far receiving the offensive player of the day monday and special teams player of the day tuesday
7785847 the coaching staff had a field goal kicking challenge at the conclusion of practice on thursday aug 7 the coaches tried to distract the kickers throughout the process from blowing whistles to tossing papers to waving hands over the ball in order to make the kickers maintain focus the final kick at practice a successful 40 yard field goal by k c lopata kept the entire squad from running sprints
7785848 lopata added a 56 yard field goal during fridays full contact scrimmage after the offensive possession stalled

7785865 people are asking me why am i still in this race it looks like its over you know i said im in this race until the democratic party takes a stand to get out of iraq to bring in u n peacekeepers and to bring our troops home im in this race until the party will pledge to provide universal single payer not for profit health care a national health care plan under which everyone is covered im in this race until the party takes s stand on behalf of fair trade where we can be sure that we have workers rights human rights and environmental quality principles in all of our trade agreements im in this race as someone who takes a stand on behalf of those who dont have a voice the democratic party can be so much more and will be so much more by our continued and consistent involvement and only if we can have this debate inside the party can we encourage people from across this country to vote democrat in november so you are an important part of our ongoing efforts

7785867 kucinich as a member of congress ive introduced legislation h
7785868 borger this is to congressman kucinich president bush last week said that yes he had expected to find weapons of mass destruction in iraq that he was using the same intelligence that had been provided to president clinton also the same intelligence that had been used by the heads of other nations do you believe that the president knowingly lied to the american people and if so why would he do that kucinich i think that this administration knew full well that iraq had nothing to do with 9 11 with al qaedas role in 9 11 with the anthrax attack on this country that iraq had neither the capability nor the intention of attacking the united states that iraq was not trying to get uranium from niger and that in fact iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction this is the singular issue upon which this election will turn and i as the only one up here who voted against the war and voted against the patriot act as the ranking democrat on a subcommittee that has jurisdiction over national security an investigative subcommittee i never saw any evidence that suggested that there was a reason for this country to go to war against iraq it was wrong to go to in its wrong to stay in it is time that we start talking about bringing our troops home bringing those guardsmen guardswomen those reservists back home stop this war get out of iraq borger so i take it the answer is yes that the president knowingly lied to the american people kucinich the president lied to the american people borger and why would he do that kucinich well you know what i cant speak for the president but i can speak as the next president of the united states laughter to say that i intend to bring those troops home by going to the u n and giving up control of the oil letting the u n handle that on an interim basis on behalf of the iraqi people letting the u n handle the contracts kucinich the united states must renounce privatization we have to ask the u n for help in developing a constitution and new elections in iraq we must pay for what we destroyed pay for a u n peacekeeping mission and provide reparations for innocent civilian non combatants who lost their lives this is the plan to get out of iraq we can get out of iraq and ill lead the way

7785878 you could still see the craters from the air bombing and unexploded ordnance was everywhere
7785879 then i heard about long chen and the fact that no one had got there since the war and i thought how do i visit and how do i make a film about it
7785880 i found it bizarre that at one time this was the second biggest city in laos and it was completely secret
7785881 laos was the progenitor of the way america fights wars in the 21st century
7785882 outsourcing the war to private companies gathering public support by falsifying intelligence and documents embedded journalism and automated warfare including the use of so called smart weapons all these methods were first tested in laos
7785883 the cia had just declassified a whole lot of material so that helped as well
7785884 the most important source was the guys who were over there filming with their little super 8 cameras often illegally
7785885 we destroyed a whole civilisation we wiped it off the map we incinerated atomised human remains in this air war and what happened in the end we lost
7785886 after we went another uk crew tried to get there but they were caught and deported
7785887 there are some places in the world that have a different energy and long chen is one of these you look down the runway and think this is the place were it all happened the planes took off from here and bombed all those people
7785888 its just an army outpost now a small village a couple of hundred people soldiers and their families
7785889 the golden age of long chen is over it used to be the high tech oasis for spooks in laos there were allegedly more antennas there than trees now they do not even have power
7785890 there are still some groups but they are not organised they are certainly not politically or militarily organised they are remnants the children and grandchildren of those involved in the war who are scared to come out of the jungle because they have never known anything else
7785891 whether vang pao is guilty or not of the charges he is facing one thing that is true is that he and other expatriate hmong have used these people as pawns
7785892 i do not see that happening in the next few years it is still far too sensitive on the part of the lao government
7785893 they are also keen not to risk unsettling relations with the americans by opening it up
7785894 it is the last chapter of the vietnam war and both governments have an interest in making sure it is forgotten
7785895 nuns are women above all else and beauty is a gift from god
7785896 you need a bit of courage to do something like this nuns deserve much more attention than they get
7785897 not just the plasticised beauty you see on television there is also such a thing as a chaste ideal which comes from the heart and the soul and has a beneficial effect on those who come into contact with it
7785898 i have had some e mails from christians who perhaps have not grasped the evangelising spirit of the initiative or the potential of the internet which is a marvellous tool for spreading the christian message unfortunately some people still have a closed mentality
7785899 i just blew my mind i blew the worlds mind
7785900 new york aug 15 when decision time comes this fall the real swing votes in the 2004 presidential election may not come from pennsylvania ohio or even the notorious florida the ultimate bush kerry battleground may turn out to be somewhere more far flung and unexpected israel britain even indonesia and both political camps say they are getting ready for the fight courting american voters who are living overseas and taking no chances that the expatriate vote will undermine them at the finish line although an official census has never been taken between 4 million and 10 million american citizens are believed to be living abroad those over 18 are entitled to have their absentee votes counted in the state where they last lived no matter how long ago that was and many are planning to do just that theres enormous interest abroad because the whole of the world depends on the result said phyllis earl 72 who lives in britain and has not voted in a u s election since 1956 two years after she moved overseas overseas voters are considered particularly important this year polls suggest razor thin margins in several battleground states and votes coming in from abroad a score here a dozen there could well tip the balance

7786068 storace si candidi la base glie lo chiede a gran voce
7786069 e paradossale che la candidatura di daniela santanche alla segreteria nazionale nasca allinsegna dello scioglimento della destra nel pdl
7786070 se daniela vuole proprio andarci ci vada da sola visto che il suo amico verdini la aiutera ad aprire quella porta che il suo ex amico la russa le ha chiuso in faccia
7786071 la destra ha fatto una campagna elettorale allinsegna della propria specificita e identita il milione di voti che abbiamo preso e fatto tutto di voti contrari a berlusconi e al progetto del pdl e questo e bene ricordarlo
7786072 personalmente non ambisco a fare il cameriere ad arcore se qualcuno ha questa passione faccia pure per quanto mi riguarda il candidato alla segreteria deve rimanere francesco storace indipendentemente da quante candidature verranno presentate il 31 agosto e se saranno piu duna e ancora da verificare
7786073 invito preventivamente tutti a riflettere anche sul fatto che nella destra al contrario di quanto dice daniela non ce nessuno che si vuole autoghettizzare anzi tutti vogliamo fare una destra di governo e se chi come lei ha aderito al partito e non lha fondato ricordiamolo avesse letto il manifesto di fondazione si sarebbe accorto che sin dallinizio nascevamo con la chiara volonta di non sciogliere la destra nel partito popolare europeo altrimenti perche saremmo usciti da an
7786074 cicchitto infine stia tranquillo non abbiamo alcuna intenzione di entrare nel suo partito i nostri conti con la storia li abbiamo fatti tutti e non abbiamo alcuna intenzione di seguire il percorso suicida di fini e compagnia bella
7786075 lo fara a titolo personale e sono certissimo che il congresso di novembre ribadira la scelta di una destra sicuramente aperta al dialogo con tutti e sottolineo tutti non solo il pdl ma anche e soprattutto orgogliosamente identitaria sociale e popolare
7786076 tenendo conto della semplificazione della politica che lelettorato ha determinato in maniera inequivocabile indicando in un bipartitismo

7786126 quite a number of the queries we track have altered recently and websites that previously ranked have dropped down by a number of places this doesnt appear to be a penalty just an alteration in the algorithm the common characteristic all the sites have is that their rankings were based very heavily on anchor text rather than on site optimization the changes dont seem to have affected major commercial queries yet but they are visible when you search for particular peoples names
7786127 ive noticed this change with one of my keyword rich domain name sites because of its domain name it receives a lot of keyword rich anchor text links but has dropped down in the rankings for a couple of the keyword phrases this possible algorithm change could well be the reason why
7786128 considering ive been playing around with repurposing some sites this is great news for me perhaps it also explains why things like kim and bills kiddie horse ranch com are ranking on things like car insurance rates
7786129 anchor text is the biggest flaw in the google algorithm i agree completely now who is playing down the importance of plain old basic seo copywriting on sphinn when i search on google i actually want to find what i am looking for on what google returns in their serps for my searches simly amazing isnt it it is about time that google finally figured it out
7786130 it is more likely that google would reduce value of backlinks with the same anchor text that come from the same domain ie having 1000 backlinks from one domain using same anchor text could be worse than having 2 3 backlinks from the same site

7786134 e gi la seconda volta che buttiamo via una vittoria contro di loro come nel 2006
7786135 dopo quello che successo mi sa che ora dovrete comperare un rigorista
7786136 vero ma allinter abbiamo regalato gi due supercoppe anche se la prima volta era stata ancora pi clamorosa nel 2006 i giallorossi erano in vantaggio 3 0 e poi furono sconfitti 4 3
7786137 eh sbagliare cos stato proprio un peccato eppure sembrava tutto come al mondiale contro laustralia io che parto dalla panchina entro a partita in corso e ho il rigore che pu decidere la gara sembrava scritto come se fosse stato un film avevo mille pensieri in testa cambio angolo rispetto al solito e se poi lo fa anche lui cos ho calciato come faccio di solito di collo interno non di collo pieno ma andata alta lo stesso peccato avevo preparato mille dediche mille esultanze
7786138 certo non ero stanco e pensare che julio cesar si era anche buttato prima del mio tiro ma l per l non me ne sono neppure accorto
7786139 no non ho fastidi mi fa solo male la caviglia per uno scontro con maicon ammazza quanto grosso
7786140 quella del portoghese gi una squadra pi organizzata sanno stare in dieci dietro la linea della palla tutti a parte ibrahimovic ma uno cos fa reparto da solo
7786141 credo che quello che siamo riusciti a esprimere dal secondo tempo in poi sia una buona base per ripartire in vista dellesordio in campionato contro il napoli niente passi falsi dobbiamo vincere
7786142 baby boomers are beginning to retire in droves and there are simply not enough young people to replace them this talent crisis which is expected to last for decades has the potential to make the dot com talent crunch of the late 1990s look like a walk in the park
7786143 experts have long predicted a global talent shortage driven by baby boomer retirements declining birth rates and long term educational trends however it was not until this year that the talent issue seemed to really hit home
7786144 the majority of surveyed companies plan to expand their workforce by more than 25 percent over the next year however over the long term a chronic shortage of talent represents the biggest obstacle to sustaining this impressive growth

7786151 i was reasonably relaxed and had no reason to be uptight
7786152 before i knew it i was out there singing the anthem on that front i was a lot more relaxed than what i normally would have been
7786153 i have never experienced a situation like this being two months without kicking a ball i just want to be fully recovered
7786154 i am not used to being sidelined i feel sad but the worst moment has already gone and i recognise that i must patient
7786155 i feel well and the time of kicking a ball is coming playing football this is what makes me happy
7786156 whilst thousands of people came to join in with the fun and spectacle of carnival once again the event ended with a small minority of people determined to fight and cause trouble
7786157 for over two hours our officers were faced with a hardcore mainly of young men who came to the carnival not to enjoy the event but to fight commit crime and cause trouble
7786158 officers had to work hard and deliver a strong interventionist style of policing late into the night to make sure that these criminals were not allowed to take over the streets of notting hill this is not the way anyone can want to see the carnival finish
7786159 through our stop and search use of screening wands and seizures of dangerous dogs we sent a clear message that the carnival is no place for such behaviour as this
7786160 i would say some people thought we were going to die
7786161 i knew it wasnt an engine problem there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold

7786163 people sometimes say when you are in a good position you need to go to a better team

7786170 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7786171 clearly we found there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified them
7786172 if we had won one of our away games and done what we have done away from home we would have had a brilliant start
7786173 but ive told the lads if they keep doing what they did in the second half that win will soon come
7786174 in the first 25 minutes or so they could really have put the game beyond us
7786175 but there were a few raised voices and changes in personnel at half time and anybody here in the second half would have had to agree that there was only one team in it and we deserved the point
7786176 ook al is het land zo divers het is vrij eenvoudig te doorgronden

7786188 people are very keen on the idea of investing in a midlands based radio service theres been a fantastic reaction
7786189 what then has to be done is translate that expression of interest into real hard cash weve had promises and commitments for several million which is extraordinary
7786190 it is by any reckoning a huge sum of money needed i dont believe that its possible on a solus basis to raise that kind of money from individual investors

7786205 one can spend a lifetime looking at oneself from the outside that is solely from the mind thinking about oneself rationalizing in all its many forms but that is not really an experience
7786206 but the encounter we are speaking of really appears in the seeing of oneself and the healing potential issues from this very seeing and not from anything else we might attempt to do little by little we begin to realize that it is seeing that will change us gradually as we grow deeper inside
7786207 the most practical thing to do is to observe your life observe without wanting to bring about a change without suppression without rationalization just observe so that you learn

7786211 the hexagram signifies the end and the beginning of all movement the back is named because in the back are located all the nerve fibres that mediate movement if the movement of these spinal nerves is brought to a standstill the ego with its restlessness disappears as it were when a man has thus become calm he may turn to the outside world he no longer sees in it the struggle and tumult of individual beings and therefore he has that true peace of mind which is needed for understanding the great laws of the universe and for acting in harmony with them whoever acts from these deep levels makes no mistakes

7786220 rivaldo wants to leave but in spite of what he says he remains under contract to aek until the end of this season and will only go if the club gets a replacement

7786259 isnt that an odd question hes a few days into office and you expect him to retire do you five days have expired not even a week after why is the issue of the retirement of the president of zimbabwe such an obsession for the west
7786260 he has come here as president of zimbabwe and he will go home as president of zimbabwe and when you visit zimbabwe he will be there as the president of all the people of zimbabwe
7786261 they can go hang they can go and hang a thousand times
7786262 the way out is the way defined by the zimbabwe people free from outside interference and that is exactly what will resolve the matter

7786270 the government of afghanistan has repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7786271 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids

7786280 i cannot confirm whether she is on hunger strike but we heard she didnt collect her food since two weeks ago we are very worried about this situation as we have no direct contact with her at all
7786281 we also heard she gave demands to the authorities two weeks ago we dont know what her demands were but it is likely they were regarding her detention
7786282 we are trying to know more the only person who has seen her is the doctor

7786290 aside from the cancellation of the result of the june 12 1993 presidential election you will agree with me that the elections conducted under my watch between 1989 and 1992 were generally free fair acceptable and credible
7786291 it is therefore easy to understand why elections conducted by the military when they are existing from power are more credible than elections conducted by nigerians when the rulers are members of one political party
7786292 the issue of interest is whether this body should be the only one to conduct elections for the national executive and legislative branches state executives and legislative branches or whether in compliance with the principles of federalism there should be conducted by two bodies as we have in the 1999 constitution or we should have three bodies each to be national state and local government election
7786293 the free flow of party formation can easily cause chaos and we know that some political parties as registered today have no existence beyond the registration certificates in the pockets of their owners they are like the ownership of petrol stations which have business when there is fuel and no business when there is no fuel

7786303 if we understand aright the dignity of this bell that tolls for our evening prayer we would be glad to make it ours by rising early in that application that it might be ours as well as his whose indeed it is the bell doth toll for him that thinks it doth and though it intermit again yet from that minute that that occasion wrought upon him he is united to god who casts not up his eye to the sun when it rises but who takes off his eye from a comet when that breaks out who bends not his ear to any bell which upon any occasion rings but who can remove it from that bell which is passing a piece of himself out of this world no man is an island entire of itself every man is a piece of the continent a part of the main if a clod be washed away by the sea europe is the less as well as if a promontory were as well as if a manor of thy friends or of thine own were any mans death diminishes me because i am involved in mankind and therefore never send to know for whom the bells tolls it tolls for thee

7786306 he was target practising with the gun and then somebody rang his mobile the gun was ready to fire and he answered the phone
7786307 rashids sister is really active and she got hold of the gun and pointed it at her brother he was on the high ground and she was on the low ground it hit him right in the middle of the back of his head
7786308 while we are still trying to establish precisely what happened this does appear to be a tragic accident involving young children
7786309 as a parent of three youngsters i know that beyond doubt this is every parents worst nightmare
7786310 no matter the circumstances everyones prayers and thoughts should be with little rashid and his family they will be going through absolute hell
7786311 migrant workers can bring enormous benefits to local businesses and areas
7786312 however many of these contributions such as new ideas and ways of working and an entrepreneurial spirit may have been neglected in the past
7786313 to get the most out of migration local communities alongside local leaders businesses universities and central government need to recognise the variety of benefits that migrants can bring and plan accordingly
7786314 political leaders also need to sharpen their narrative about migration particularly on the longer term effects on local areas
7786315 migration flows are critical but the bigger story is how we manage more diverse communities to deliver the greatest benefits for all

7786344 in a sense bowlers have become defensive they play more of limited overs cricket where there is nothing much on offer for them remaining tight with line and length is not easy

7786365 obviously theres been quite a bit of community backlash against the decision so the minister just asked for them to have another look and see if thats what they really want to do the spokeswoman said
7786366 prime minister kevin rudd and consumer affairs minister chris bowen must acknowledge the absurdity of grocerychoice and shut the site down immediately
7786367 the council of small business has correctly highlighted the farcical nature of the grocerychoice website
7786368 they make the point that the site is misleading consumers because there is no reference to any specific stores
7786369 the sad reality is that this website could have a detrimental impact on the supermarket sector by providing free promotion to the major supermarket retailers
7786370 the website does not take into account the consumer savings from the convenience of independent stores and it does not take into account the price variations which exist within the independent sector and at different coles and woolworths stores

7786374 they are definitely the toughest opponents weve had in a champions league qualifier i know people expect us to get through but its not as if were playing a mickey mouse team
7786375 the belgian league has a lot of quality and their champions are used to getting into the group stages we had a tough match against anderlecht a few years ago so im not surprised liege caused us problems
7786376 they caught us a bit cold in the first leg but you have to remember that they had gone something like 30 games unbeaten in their own league and they are a club with european pedigree
7786377 we didnt play well and we know well have to improve at anfield everyone knows how important it is for our season to get into the group stage
7786378 its always a funny time for us to have such a massive game before weve got going in the season some of our results have reflected that
7786379 we lost at home to ak graz in the year we won the competition and had a narrow win in the last minute against maccabi haifa two years ago so anyone thinking well win comfortably knows thats very dangerous
7786380 i believe im at the top of my game right now and like any player i want to win things i dont want to look back on my career and think i only won the carling league cup dajohnner

7786384 people love to sit in their backyards and watch birds its much harder to watch bats because they are nocturnal
7786385 it was important for us to determine as much as we could about this issue
7786386 we had to be quite patient mainly because we were started from a knowledge base that wasnt quite zero but very very low
7786387 were in the age of modern communications and you cant find a half hour in that period of time to either sit down or talk by phone that isnt schedules not linking up that is a decision thats being made not to talk
7786388 there is no crisis except the one being manufactured by harper
7786389 weve never been told there was a time limit for this meeting other than it was to happen before the house reconvened as it was meant to be about this sitting of parliament
7786390 this is an invention by mr harper to try to trigger an election before he loses the by elections
7786391 this is full improvisation and it shows panic from the prime minister
7786392 itll be straightforward and the bill will not be open to misinterpretation
7786393 the government and the prime minister have been very clear on this that we are not reopening the debate on abortion
7786394 great progress is being made with what is essential maintenance work that will ensure this great building is fit for purpose for the next 100 years
7786395 happily there has been minimal disruption to services provided by belfast city council and we have done everything possible to ensure that the closure did not inconvenience local residents
7786396 it makes sense that when city hall reopens our customer facing services will be located there i have always been a supporter of encouraging public use of our wonderful city hall for all to enjoy whether they are ratepayers or visitors this massive refurbishment is a once in a century opportunity to plan for the benefit of future generations

7786471 we understand that vuestar has sent invoices for around s 5 000 us 3 676 to various parties in singapore asking them to enter into such license agreements or to cease allowing images on a parties web site to be downloaded or used in singapore
7786472 we believe that this development would have a wide ranging impact on the internet community in singapore given the wide claims made by vuestar on the intellectual property covered by the patents
7786473 parties operating web sites offering web services or developing web based and wap based products and services need to be especially careful
7786474 we believe we have a duty to protect our intellectual property and we would expect companies to pay a reasonable royalty based on the revenues that they have enjoyed through the use of that intellectual property
7786475 is it good public policy to allow patents like this i think this claim illustrates the problems youve got with the patent system
7786476 they would have an exclusive right the right to stop you cold from using the web
7786477 the evidence was insufficient for a reasonable jury to find that mr vosburgh specifically intended to download child pornography a necessary element of any attempt offense
7786478 i thought it was scary that they could do this this whole idea that the fbi can put a honeypot out there to attract people is kind of sad it seems to me that theyve brought a lot of cases without having to stoop to this
7786479 covert fbi computer in san jose california and the file located therein was encrypted and non pornographic
7786480 would not have negated a substantial basis for concluding that there was probable cause to believe that evidence of child pornography would be found on the premises to be searched
7786481 claims of entrapment have been made in similar cases but usually do not get very far
7786482 the individuals who chose to log into the fbi sites appear to have had no pressure put upon them by the government it is doubtful that the individuals could claim the government made them do something they werent predisposed to doing or that the government overreached
7786483 no reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that mr vosburgh himself attempted to download child pornography
7786484 the jury found that defendant knew exactly what he was trying to obtain when he downloaded the hyperlinks on agent luders ranchi post at trial defendant suggested unrealistic unlikely explanations as to how his computer was linked to the post the jury saw through the smokes sic and mirrors as should the court
7786485 every two years you need to buy this new machine that allows you to print something thats smaller and finer
7786486 if nanochip can move the probes one tenth the distance for example they can get 100 times the density with no change in the lithography
7786487 same machinery same equipment same materials same basic processing steps youre just creating three dimensional objects instead of a flat integrated circuit
7786488 when you have an array of these chips you have many many points of access
7786489 just like the output of a nand flash drive or disk drive but in fact the data is spread out over a few hundred tips
7786490 the tips that form the core of this memory technology are whats being used in atomic force microscopes
7786491 obviously you have a lot of tip wear that goes into an enterprise server thats operating 24 7 for five six or seven years
7786492 the thing that strikes me about 100gb is that its a nice size for something to replace a disk in a notebook pc
7786493 all theyve got to do is come close to the price of a disk and then offer some other advantage it may consume less power than a disk it could be more rugged
7786494 well make the interface so itll just plug and play
7786495 its a new technology but you want it to fit right in
7786496 you now need your whole life history stored in your mobile device
7786497 if you want something to store your genome in it may take a lot of memory and youll want to carry it with you
7786498 in 2010 its going to be 1 per gigabyte so hopefully the cost per gigabyte of probe based arrays is going to be low
7786499 the focus of our research is to explore ways to enhance the speed in probe sensing and the way we modify the surface how fast we can do those things there are many things that come together from positioning control to materials to micro machining micro fabricating so its extremely fascinating altogether

7786503 that the 8 bit tower jumpers and the negative score applied to each wtc tower to indicate damage arent going to sit well with were thinking everyone we know who doesnt hate freedom
7786504 spending more time absorbing and of course playing invaders gives one a better perspective on what stanley was aiming for
7786505 invaders may be unsettling with its blending of archaic gameplay and modern day catastrophe but its also an impressive accomplishment in that it delivers complex messages via simple means
7786506 after three days of a steady downward spiral in public discussion of the piece i have just given my agreement to the organisers of the leipzig games convention to simply turn off the installation invaders
7786507 the american response to this work has been frankly immature and lacking the sophistication and consideration that other parts of the world have so far shown the work
7786508 rolling on the floor mock laughing at their read media disgusting sense of humour
7786509 i notice some readers showing anger and anguish at some of the negative media reports in buzz 18 and cnn ibn well what can i say even before the shows started i had made you aware of this and warned you so they live up to my predictions this is a glorious moment for me i dictate they emulate
7786510 it is a desperate and futile attempt at defaming destroying and belittling a well accomplished achievement one that is done and over with to amazing result one sadly they will never be a part of and one they shall never be able to recreate they find themselves on crutches a most despicable condition they brilliantly managed by and this is both laughable and ironical axing their own feet

7786514 her people have to be deeply worried by these returns
7786515 we said all along that we had a lot of work to do and that we werent taking anything for granted
7786516 were still viewing it like that we havent changed our game plan
7786517 the obama wave is also there and were confident that that will have an impact in this state
7786518 for months democrats have tried to say this race wont be close
7786519 the polls have been saying otherwise the primary results just confirmed that its dead even again
7786520 youre going to have a ton of young voters who will come out and vote for obama and no one else on the ticket

7786525 i can only apologize that mrs fitzgerald perceived a sense of callousness or a sense that there was some additional diagnostic or other measures to be offered
7786526 it will renew our emphasis to va staff about sensitivity in communicating
7786527 i can only apologize for the familys perception in this tragic case and to let them know that it will serve as a system wide reminder about the importance of clear and compassionate communication
7786528 ive never stumped before but i want to be a part of this
7786529 we are going to change the constitution and say on nov
7786530 california should do more to encourage families to stay together
7786531 we are now controlling most of the key government offices to prevent them from coming to work
7786532 today we declare a long long holiday for the government
7786533 the thing that i am trying to work out right now is an idea that i had ten years ago which i am still worried on the technical side whether its possible or not even today
7786534 i belong to lakas and i am the only one who has signified my intention to run for president if someone else says he wants to run then the party will have to study that
7786535 the senate has jurisdiction over trillanes being a member of the senate that is clear in the 1987 constitution and in our rules but at the same time the judiciary also has a jurisdiction over him
7786536 it does not mean that we have lost our jurisdiction over his trillanes person because of the cases pending in the court what we have at the moment would be competing jurisdiction and the authority of senate to ensure that he would attend the session should be recognized but it should go through due process
7786537 in short he can attend the sessions but the approval of the court is still needed
7786538 for the court to allow us to exercise our jurisdiction over his person also
7786539 lobjet sonore maintenant pierre schaeffer sound objects and the phenomenological reduction
7786540 rather than look to empiricism to provide a solution husserl sought an objective but non empirical foundation for logic
7786541 the acousmatic experience reduces sounds to the field of hearing alone
7786542 entendre represents a mode of listening that actively selects appreciates and responds to particular attributes of sounds
7786543 many of the techniques developed for producing concrete works depend upon variation the composer subjects pre recorded sounds to filtration editing looping reverberation or changes in speed or direction the results of such processes must be tested again within the sphere of listening to determine whether these variations present us with the same sound object or new sound objects entirely each variation is an investigation into the objectivity of the sound object

7786545 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7786546 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7786547 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams especially in flash flood type of storms where a lot of water and debris are generated very quickly and can pile up against the fences very rapidly
7786548 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
7786549 he does not waive us doing what we would have to do without the waiver so it doesnt change anything in the environment
7786550 a cookbook titled a treasury of great recipes sounds innocuous whats frightening about noodle casserole why nothing except when its cooked by vincent price
7786551 for those who know price from classic 1950s horror films like the fly and the house of wax
7786552 but the prices culinary fame rests primarily upon their 1965 collection a treasury of great recipes which culled recipes and reproduced menus from top restaurants around the world everyone who owns this volume swears by it for one reason above all others the treasury is a shockingly terrifyingly good example of 1960s cuisine thrill to kodachromes of vincent brooding in a wine cellar having bricked a victim alive in its walls scream to the exquisite kitsch of the prices in formal wear serving champagne in their rv the campy meets the campsite
7786553 in place of eliots severe public intellectual we have forster the chatty librarian leaning over the counter advising you on whether a book is worth the bother or not a peculiarly english aesthetic category its a self imposed role entirely lacking in intellectual vanity but its a mistake to think it a lazy or accidental one connection as everyone knows was forsters great theme between people nations heart and head labor and art radio presented him with the opportunity of mass connection it went against his grain to put any obstacle between his listeners and himself
7786554 with only a week to go before the donkeys kick up their heels in denver the powers that be at the new york times acting in their unofficial capacity as mouth organ for the democratic party have published what amounts to the playbook for the presentation of
7786555 the title of the piece for convention obamas image is all american gives the game away most people in possession of a dictionary would see the use of the word image as the desire to present an illusion rather than an actuality kind of like they do in hollywood
7786556 and indeed following a trend that began with bill clinton and his buds harry and linda bloodworth thomason who not coincidentally are producing the video that will precede hillarys convention address the dems have tapped davis guggenheim to create a film that seeks to address what the times calls obamas otherness mr guggenheim as you may remember was the director and producer of al gores an inconvenient truth so he is no stranger to the art of truth defying imagery

7786559 these findings show that two widely held views are false that america is riddled with ageism and that younger people have no respect for older people while there is surely some prejudice against older people which sometimes leads to age discrimination the two oldest generations the silent and the greatest generations are much more admired than any other generation
7786560 another common belief shown to be false in this survey is that baby boomers are widely seen as particularly self indulgent or even greedy in reality boomers get higher marks than other generations for being socially conscious productive and having a positive effect on society

7786586 so were kind of on a train thats going over a cliff and we just have to stop get out and find another way
7786587 the majority of americans are not in a position to engage in fine dining on a regular basis
7786588 very little substantive change has come to our poorest neighborhoods
7786589 i realized chez panisse has always been a slow food restaurant
7786590 i think that good pure affordable wholesome food should be available to everybody
7786591 and it should be a right and not a privilege
7786592 no sooner did we get the green revolution no sooner did the specter of mass starvation get pushed aside than we got this organic nonsense
7786593 i get a basic disdain for america and the american way of doing things from slow food
7786594 were building a stage on which a lot of organizations could bring their message and their hope for a more sustainable and more just food system
7786595 its old media meets new media its new media meets new media im just here to meet somebody
7786596 i just wonder if bloggers can have as much impact when they are in the same place as the big dogs
7786597 the bottom line is that people no longer want to be spectators technology allows us to essentially become participants
7786598 i just asked for free food free wifi and free beer
7786599 this time we have delegates uploading videos from the convention center
7786600 we joined the coalition with full sincerity for the restoration of democracy unfortunately all the promises were not honored
7786601 you see barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to
7786602 you see thats just not how he sees the world he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future he knows that that thread is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7786603 we say john mccain has the experience of being wrong
7786604 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7786605 and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7786606 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7786607 john mccain has spent more than 25 years in washington voting against womens freedom
7786608 and has pledged to appoint justices to the supreme court who will overturn roe v wade
7786609 know that this son of a single mom will stand up for the dreams of our daughters and i know that john mccain wont
7786610 a sturdy woman and an eternal optimist who understood that parents are our first and best teachers
7786611 in middle school your parents do more for you but in high school its all on you
7786612 to go from being big man on campus in middle school to little man on campus in high school is traumatic
7786613 at 14 students are right on the cusp some of them are still children you see girls carrying around stuffed animals and a lot of kids still watch cartoons but they are also in puberty and part of that means trying to assert themselves and forge an identity
7786614 theres a lot of pressure to figure out not only who you are but where you want to go in life
7786615 any point of transition in our lives is a major challenge if you think of marriage or divorce or having children going to college starting a new job any time we reach a point of transition we need support
7786616 the key to high school success is a strong ninth grade foundation
7786617 students who get off to a weak start easily get discouraged and have a lot of trouble in 10th and 11th grade its all about engagement and connection kids need to feel connected to school
7786618 they probably do like you but they are being tough on you because they want you to pass
7786619 you cant go to the counselors and say you want to switch a class because the teacher doesnt like you they wont buy that but dont be afraid to ask your teachers for help thats their job

7786622 its going to be a disappointment if we dont do what we think we can do
7786623 its what we work for all year itll be a big disappointment if we let ourselves down
7786624 i definitely dont want to make sports center for that we cant let that happen
7786625 just watching film they surprise me a lot i hadnt heard a lot about them theyre not a big school but they do a lot of things really well theyll mix it up theyll surprise you with a lot of things they were playing their best ball at the end of the year you always have to look at the last game that tells you a lot about a team coming into this season

7786630 theres no question that it made the south more conservative the democrats not contesting the south
7786631 you know when i came to georgia in the 1980s overwhelmingly the georgia congressional delegation was democratic the governor was democratic and the legislature was democratic and they were not right wing democrats some of them were very progressive i think what happened is when the republicans played their race card in the south the democrats abandoned the south and as a result the south became more and more conservative because the democrats were not contesting the south that was and is a terrible mistake
7786632 the other thing that happened is that unions pulled out of the south basically concluding you could not win
7786633 that was not our experience in the 80s and 90s unions started putting their resources into places that were easier so the result is that half the union membership in america is concentrated in six states thats not a good situation because it really corrals our effect on american society
7786634 in the early 70s when i went there the south was a place where the perception or label was that you could not organize was not what i found
7786635 but workers are not anti union in the south employers in the south are the press politicians and employers but not workers i found that workers if they felt like there was a way to win that they would fight
7786636 southern employers in the 70s 80s and even 90s were more willing to divide workers by playing the race card than they were in the north
7786637 lifes more complicated now in the south i think people are less susceptible to that youve got immigrants youve got latinos youve got asians in our plant in atlanta youve got all kinds of african and asian immigrants its not as simple for the companies to divide the workers
7786638 hes contesting north carolina were going to carry virginia i think georgias within reach mississippi you know people talk about mississippi as a backwater state ive worked in mississippi my whole career democrats have always done well there and mississippi has a progressive tradition

7786647 ik heb die de voorbije dagen te veel geforceerd gisteren kon ik nauwelijks spreken
7786648 ik ben moe maar heel tevreden opnieuw thuiskomen is altijd zeer leuk ik besef nog niet goed wat er allemaal gaande is dat zal de komende dagen pas echt goed tot me doordringen ik wil me de komende dagen vooral uitrusten met het oog op de memorial van damme van volgende week vrijdag
7786649 ik ben zeer blij voor haar voor de medaille en vooral voor de manier waarop ze die heeft gewonnen
7786650 ik ben nu vooral moe na een reis van meer dan 10 uur ik heb de voorbije dagen weinig geslapen door al die opwinding na mijn zege
7786651 ik weet dat ik hier opgewacht wordt door een grote groep mensen uit mijn woonplaats tessenderlo die ik allemaal als mijn vrienden beschouw ik hoop dat ik vanavond wat tijd kan doorbrengen met mijn familie en vrienden ik ben drie weken weggeweest en verlang daar nu echt wel naar
7786652 morgen vetrek ik alweer naar z rich waar ik vrijdag moet springen ik vind dat een zeer leuke meeting maar moet wel toegeven dat ik me op dit moment wel wat gebroken voel ik hoop dat ik tegen de memorial van damme op vrijdag 5 september nvdr weer ok ben en dat ik daar iets kan tonen
7786653 ik weet niet goed wat er me nu allemaal te wachten staat pas de volgende dagen zal ik denk ik beseffen wat ik heb teweeg gebracht ik hoop wel dat de media beseffen dat ik onmogelijk op alle vragen kan ingaan
7786654 op papier is een vrijlating mogelijk maar in de praktijk ben ik niet optimistisch

7786671 consumers gain control over surging energy costs governments get chance to promote energy conservation and the energy industry players are able to become more efficient
7786672 germany did not go all the way with the recent energy and climate act an unclear regulatory framework and uncertainty about the future threaten to further delay adoption of smart metering in the country
7786673 if the british government is honest about its commitment to reducing carbon emissions it really has no other alternative than to push ahead with smart metering for all energy customers

7786686 i wouldnt characterize it as a good pr move what i would say is that we are always concerned when someone takes his own life because as americans we value life even the lives of violent terrorists who are captured waging war against our country

7786697 due to similarities in the wording of the statements and the manner of suicides as well as statements made by other detainees interviewed
7786698 there was growing concern that someone within the camp delta population was directing detainees to commit suicide and that additional suicides might be imminent
7786699 the cells of other detainees were searched during the week following the suicides in an attempt to find evidence regarding whether the suicides had been part of a larger conspiracy which might result in additional detainees also taking their lives
7786700 additional handwritten notes found in cells other than those where the suicides took place
7786701 and other documents reveal that the men took advantage of lapses in guard protocol and of lenient policies toward compliant detainees to commit what suicide notes described as an attack on the united states
7786702 investigators found that guards had become lax on certain rules because commanders wanted to reward the more compliant detainees giving them extra t shirts blankets and towels detainees were allowed to hang such items to dry or to provide privacy while using the toilet but were not supposed to be able to obscure their cells while sleeping guards told officials that it was not unusual to see blankets hanging in the cells and that they did not think twice when they passed several cells on the night of june 9 2006 with blankets strung through the wire mesh authorities believe the men probably hanged themselves around 10 p m but they were not discovered until shortly after midnight on june 10

7786704 a mid to high level al qaeda operative who had key ties to principal facilitators and senior members of the group
7786705 although many of the individuals apprehended during the raid have strong connections to al qaeda there is no credible information to suggest ahmed received terrorist related training or is a member of the al qaeda network
7786706 senior pentagon official who read the report and provided details in exchange for anonymity
7786707 that the navy investigation found the simultaneous suicides to be acts of defiance and martyrdom
7786708 left unexplained one key question why guards had not checked on the men for two and a half hours before they were discovered hanging in their cells
7786709 tours of the prison camps have described a strict doctrine that had guards check on each detainee every few minutes
7786710 its simply astounding that it took the government over two years to conclude a so called investigation of three men who died in a small cage under the governments exclusive control the investigation itself is what needs to be investigated along with the people whove perpetrated the disgraceful extra constitutional detentions
7786711 several of the detainees had had a vision in which three of them had to die for the rest to be freed
7786712 they have lost hope in life they have no hope in their eyes they are ghosts and they want to die no food will keep them alive now even with four feeds a day these men get diarrhea from any protein which goes right through them
7786713 said that dinner had come early that evening and that everyone in the block suddenly got tired and had fallen asleep even though it was never quiet in the block at that hour even when the guards left us in peace there was always someone who couldnt fall asleep who wanted to pray or who kept waking up throughout the night
7786714 the metal shutters in front of the windows had also been closed from the outside as if a storm were approaching
7786715 he had been woken up in the middle of the night by a loud bang
7786716 we didnt think that could be true he would have had to attach the noose to the sharp metal lattices with his hands and feet tied and with no chair to stand on that was nearly impossible
7786717 it seemed highly unlikely that the guards would have failed to catch him in time
7786718 they barely let us out of their sight for a minute
7786719 the guards claimed he had covered the walls of his cage so that they hadnt seen him do it but what was he supposed to have used to cover the cage the same sheets with which he allegedly hung himself
7786720 it was not unusual to see blankets hanging in the cells
7786721 and what about the rule prohibiting us from hanging anything on the walls of our cells
7786722 it seemed too much of a coincidence that the other two dead men had hung themselves at exactly the same time in exactly the same way in the same block while all the other inmates had been sleeping like babies when the guards were patrolling the corridors it never took long before other guards came to ensure we were following the rules the guards never took a break since they too were kept under surveillance to ensure that they too were carrying out their duties
7786723 and what about the sharpshooters in the watchtowers hadnt they noticed anything
7786724 didnt seem to have much of a reason for killing himself
7786725 no we prisoners unanimously agreed the men had been killed maybe they had been beaten to death and then strung up or perhaps they had been strangled
7786726 if prisoners died in guant namo it would create trouble for the bush government and they wouldnt have to take part in the war

7786728 on the 8th day god created the u s army and the devil stood at attention
7786729 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
7786730 moderation in temper is always a virtue but moderation in principle is always a vice
7786731 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
7786732 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
7786733 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
7786734 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
7786735 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
7786736 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
7786737 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
7786738 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
7786739 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
7786740 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
7786741 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
7786742 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
7786743 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
7786744 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
7786745 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
7786746 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
7786747 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
7786748 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
7786749 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
7786750 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
7786751 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
7786752 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
7786753 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
7786754 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
7786755 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
7786756 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
7786757 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
7786758 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
7786759 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
7786760 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
7786761 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
7786762 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
7786763 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
7786764 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
7786765 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
7786766 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
7786767 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
7786768 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
7786769 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
7786770 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
7786771 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
7786772 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
7786773 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
7786774 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
7786775 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
7786776 the human race has improved everything except the human race adlai stephenson
7786777 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
7786778 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine
7786779 try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value

7786784 im going to the convention because i want to see hillary
7786785 i want to be inspired by her encouraged by her to do whats going to be the best thing for all of our futures shes trying to help us all get through this
7786786 i dont think that senator obama understands how deep this commitment goes to hillary and where this passion comes from
7786787 im also a very very devoted democrat so this is a very hard situation john mccain is unacceptable
7786788 hillary supporters should take their cues from her and follow her lead
7786789 will probably throw in a reference to him in her speech
7786790 its unfortunate as we circle together if we shoot ourselves
7786791 we absolutely cannot afford to let this opportunity pass us by
7786792 its not really hillarys job to bring the party together its obamas job
7786793 women have the most to gain with the election of barack obama and the most to lose with the election of john mccain this is the conversation im having with women

7786797 a strict curfew remains in force all over the kashmir valley
7786798 when you win in three sets it is a good results
7786799 i had some difficult moments in the match so that is going to help me be prepared for the pressure moments later on
7786800 i tried to keep my level up i tried to hurry him
7786801 he was hitting his forehand really hard and making me do a bit of running
7786802 it was a decent test and i came through it pretty well
7786803 in the first set i felt like i was playing against a wall
7786804 in the second set i told myself to just play your game and dont give up
7786805 it is tough to play opponent who doesnt have anything to lose
7786806 i didnt know she was 16 until they made the announcement before the match i did as much as i needed to win the match
7786807 they are definitely the toughest opponents weve had in a champions league qualifier i know people expect us to get through but its not as if were playing a mickey mouse team
7786808 the belgian league has a lot of quality and their champions are used to getting into the group stages we had a tough match against anderlecht a few years ago so im not surprised liege caused us problems
7786809 they caught us a bit cold in the first leg but you have to remember that they had gone something like 30 games unbeaten in their own league and they are a club with european pedigree
7786810 we didnt play well and we know well have to improve at anfield everyone knows how important it is for our season to get into the group stage
7786811 its always a funny time for us to have such a massive game before weve got going in the season some of our results have reflected that
7786812 we lost at home to ak graz in the year we won the competition and had a narrow win in the last minute against maccabi haifa two years ago so anyone thinking well win comfortably knows thats very dangerous
7786813 i believe im at the top of my game right now and like any player i want to win things i dont want to look back on my career and think i only won the carling league cup
7786814 i want to push on and win more and thats one of the reasons why i came to liverpool another reason is the fact that ive always been a fan and if i could win something with this team it would be a dream come true
7786815 the information which the accused had given to caroline amounted to disclosing serious illegal insider trading activity and also raised great concerns about the fire and the insurance
7786816 carolines possession of this information was potentially very damaging to the relationship between the accused and rene rivkin a relationship which he valued very very highly
7786817 sometimes he gets so angry its like he wants to kill me
7786818 hes under a lot of pressure sometimes i fear for my life with gordon
7786819 the only reasonable explanation for his knowledge is that he was there when she went over
7786820 we continue to find the way to reach an agreement between israel and the palestinians
7786821 very heartened by the fact that the negotiations are serious and they are intensive
7786822 in fact i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together over this period of time
7786823 construction in the settlements has increased by a factor of 1 8 by comparison to the same period last year
7786824 the housing ministry initiated 433 new housing units during the period of january to may 2008 compared to just 240 units during the period january to may 2007
7786825 i would like to suggest to my partners not to use it as an excuse and i know they are not using it as an excuse but i understand their frustration sometimes
7786826 but at the end of the day the israeli governments policy is not to expand settlements not to build new settlements and not to confiscate palestinian land
7786827 there were some small activities but they will not influence the ability to negotiate nor the future of the future borders of the palestinian state
7786828 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and that anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7786829 and we will continue to press ahead to get agreement so that we know what is in israel and what is palestinian
7786830 the springboks will get worse if they continue in this way
7786831 mate no one in world rugby is playing the way their coach is talking about not successfully anyway
7786832 everyone has discipline policies and a procedure in their game the way he is talking is nonsense you cant just play an expansive wide game
7786833 this is still a very good squad of players most are even at their peak or approaching it so there is plenty of talent but what they need is the organisation and discipline
7786834 the hard thing for peter is that he has never coached professionally and this is one of the most difficult teams to coach
7786835 theyre attacking off everything and theyre going lateral not through defences you have to go through sides like australia and new zealand first
7786836 but he has to change his philosophy because it doesnt fit these players its not credible
7786837 peters big test now is to learn if he learns he can turn it around but if he continues to be stubborn he wont last long because his tactics wont work
7786838 if a company is doing badly then you blame the managing director so it is right and fair that the coach be held responsible
7786839 peter de villiers his management team and playing squad have my unequivocal backing
7786840 peters future is secure we are not in the business of sacking springbok coaches within three months of their first match

7786860 op papier is een vrijlating mogelijk maar in de praktijk ben ik niet optimistisch
7786861 het onderzoek is verre van afgelopen de exacte rol die iedereen gespeeld heeft moet nog bekeken worden net als de druk die mogelijk op gilbert bodart is uitgeoefend
7786862 ik heb de indruk dat hij al twee jaar heel moeilijke dingen meemaakt
7786863 ik ben nu vooral moe na een reis van meer dan 10 uur ik heb de voorbije dagen weinig geslapen door al die opwinding na mijn zege
7786864 ik weet dat ik hier opgewacht wordt door een grote groep mensen uit mijn woonplaats tessenderlo die ik allemaal als mijn vrienden beschouw ik hoop dat ik vanavond wat tijd kan doorbrengen met mijn familie en vrienden ik ben drie weken weggeweest en verlang daar nu echt wel naar
7786865 morgen vetrek ik alweer naar z rich waar ik vrijdag moet springen ik vind dat een zeer leuke meeting maar moet wel toegeven dat ik me op dit moment wel wat gebroken voel ik hoop dat ik tegen de memorial van damme op vrijdag 5 september nvdr weer ok ben en dat ik daar iets kan tonen
7786866 ik weet niet goed wat er me nu allemaal te wachten staat pas de volgende dagen zal ik denk ik beseffen wat ik heb teweeg gebracht ik hoop wel dat de media beseffen dat ik onmogelijk op alle vragen kan ingaan

7786874 carolines possession of this information was potentially very damaging to the relationship between the accused and rene rivkin a relationship which he valued very very highly

7786877 it was just great to meet him and meet people you usually see on tv like tennis no1 rafael nadal and roger federer

7786884 i was thinking maybe two three years maybe cracking the wallabies but its come around quick
7786885 but ive trained hard and ive prepared myself well so if it does come to saturday where i do start i think the team and robbie will have confidence in me and ill have confidence in myself as well
7786886 the things he does tell me are really important and i take them in
7786887 hes been really good to me just at training little things that i need to work on my game he helps me if its skills or if its just talking about mindset during the games
7786888 i havent been back much since i stopped playing tennis
7786889 its an honor to be invited to this event it brings back memories and this is the best memory that i have when i won the tournament
7786890 i thought it was the best wimbledon final i have ever seen and that includes mine
7786891 i get the feeling we will have a surprise here
7786892 my gut is telling me that there will be someone else in front obviously it was a long summer for nadal i dont know how he keeps it up physically anyway so lets be surprised
7786893 i have no idea what happened but it feels better now
7786894 our reward for four weeks of primarily miserable weather was day after day of sunshine and sensational racing topped by surely one of the most exciting
7786895 ive played more of a ball playing role this year anyway so its just an extension of this
7786896 campo is definitely going to do the bulk of the kicking but we do have options
7786897 i can kick if we need something and glen buttriss has the ability out of dummy half as well
7786898 hes had an mri on it today so theyre just assessing if hell need surgery immediately or if we can nurse it through another week or two
7786899 just after the contact on the weekend we need to determine whether it needs surgery straight away

7786912 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7786913 i think its no secret and i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think that settlement activity is helpful
7786914 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7786915 the role of the leaders is to try to find a way to live in peace in the future and not to let any kind of noises that relate to the situation on the ground these days to enter the negotiation room
7786916 but at the end of the day the israeli governments policy is not to expand settlements not to build new settlements and not to confiscate palestinian land
7786917 despite the israeli governments renewed commitment during the annapolis summit to freeze all settlement activity the construction has continued and almost doubled in all of the settlements and outposts on both sides of the separation barrier
7786918 this construction undermines the palestinian partners creating facts on the ground that might prevent the possibility of a peace agreement

7786935 should i venture far far away for vietnamese sandwiches i have never tasted before
7786936 the talented and knowledgeable artists who work here have a subtle eye for what will look great and distinctive no matter what you are
7786937 the proposal is downright ridiculous the number of foreign bound filipino domestic helpers with potential psychiatric issues is insignificant compared to the overall volume
7786938 a number of them develop behavioral issues on the job overseas but this is mainly due to vicious foreign employers who practically enslave their maids and force them to work and live under inhuman conditions
7786939 some abusive employers resort to basically detaining their domestic staff and denying them normal access to the outside world naturally the maids risk developing behavioral issues over time
7786940 thus their psychiatric problems are largely environmentally induced not necessarily organic
7786941 we simply do not have the competence what will happen is that untrained personnel of diagnostic centers will end up administering and interpreting the test results thus the tests wont be effective
7786942 we do not have adequate behavioral health care services here we do not have enough psychiatrists and mental health professionals to conduct the tests and process the results correctly
7786943 this could be a big racket for them the test could mean additional income on the side for recruiters and their allied diagnostic centers

7786945 domestic workers should be assessed if they are able to respond be able to take this type of stress
7786946 bakit hindi mo ayusin yung conditions na yan so that yung mga filipina will not undergo yung mga ganyang working and living conditions
7786947 its the heads of the dfa officials not the ofws that should be examined they must be crazy if they think mandatory psychiatric tests could help prevent abused ofws from snapping out of their mind in the workplace
7786948 for the arroyo government those they have hailed as bagong bayani new heroes are lunatics by refusing to acknowledge these realities of abuse oppression and other sufferings of the workers and by conveniently glossing over the fact that most of the time ofws commit crimes to defend themselves while others are just plain victims of frame up by abusive employers the dfa in essence is condemning our ofws
7786949 there are a number of complications that obese people face later in life including poor coordination and the understanding has always been that these complications are a result of the obesity

7786985 well since my wife and i own the business and since we pour our blood sweat and tears into this i think im going to give it 5 stars for those of you who dont know eq3 is an internationally acclaimed business but it is locally owned and operated my wife and i opened the first eq3 store in the us in san francisco 4 years ago and we just opened our second store in emeryville only a few months ago eq3 is growing rapidly we of course have our own share of growing pains but we are aware of them and are working through them quickly on production and supply we do try to stock items in our emeryville warehouse its difficult to stock everything but since our main warehouse is in canada if it isnt in stock we can usually turn it around in 10 14 days now there are times when certain high demand items are on backorder this is an incredibly frustrating experience for both us and the customer but unfortunately it is something that we just cant control on couches chairs loveseats ottomans pillows etc these are all produced and manufactured in north america we have literally have hundereds of fabrics and leathers to choose from so turn around can be instant or up to 6 8 weeks another thing to note is the fact that we stand behind our products and offer great warranties on every piece of furniture we sell we also care very very much about our customers and our community if you go into one of our stores youll find all local orignal art from emerging bay area artists we also have some really cool parties at our stores so if you are interested in coming to any make sure you get on the list i hope this has been helpful for anyone whos interested in our company and feel free to drop me a comment if you have any questions or concerns

7787016 both the car and the suspect were taken to the de deur police station where a case of car theft was opened
7787017 unknown to the police i had reset my speedometer reading to zero when i went to collect the car on monday it smelled of alcohol and had been driven for 66km and also had not been parked the way i had
7787018 the same morning i was forced to drive the vehicle to the vereeniging car pound a task that should have been done by the police
7787019 the woman is lying about her car being driven after she had left it at the station

7787046 for the oil year 2007 08 we have already lost one million tons of food demand and about 5 00 000 tons of bio diesel demand as a result of high prices
7787047 incremental supply exceeded incremental demand by almost 1 5 million tonnes and the bulk of this excess has come in the second half of the year
7787048 i believe the strong price rises of the first quarter of 2008 finally began to meet resistance in the second quarter and got reflected in the volume of business transaction during june
7787049 we saw strong evidence of this in the case of sunflower oil and soya oil

7787093 its effort to keep south ossetia with force was as senseless as milosevics effort over kosovo
7787094 such expressions only added to the general confusion in serbia
7787095 particularly so when georgian actions against south ossetia were compared with srebrenica by russians
7787096 the decision on what to say about russia georgia and south ossetia was a very complicated one for belgrade
7787097 ordinary people liked the show of force by russia however thats tough if you openly support russia you violate the idea of territorial integrity of georgia
7787098 kosovo is a unique case not to be compared to any other in the world

7787139 when you win in three sets it is a good results
7787140 i had some difficult moments in the match so that is going to help me be prepared for the pressure moments later on
7787141 i tried to keep my level up i tried to hurry him
7787142 he was hitting his forehand really hard and making me do a bit of running
7787143 it was a decent test and i came through it pretty well
7787144 in the first set i felt like i was playing against a wall
7787145 in the second set i told myself to just play your game and dont give up
7787146 it is tough to play opponent who doesnt have anything to lose

7787152 we believe that it is affordable in the current budget settings that we can have more substantial tax cuts and we will look for that commitment from the liberal party if it is elected mr nicolaou said
7787153 they are modest over four years that doesnt deliver significant amounts of tax cuts so we would certainly think that is modest but if you can look at public sector reform then there is an opportunity for more substantial tax cuts to be delivered
7787154 how are western australians to believe his promise when he cant spell out who will benefit and by how much
7787155 the bishops got together to explain what the church teaches
7787156 thats right and a lot of ideas came out of vatican ii one of the most lasting is the idea of participation the idea that members of the laity are called to participate fully in the mass what do you think of when you hear the word participation
7787157 yes thats generally what participation means and when it comes to the mass its about joining your heart and soul with the prayers of the priest to god during the years after vatican ii the word came to take on a very external meaning do you know what i mean by that
7787158 what i mean is that many people came to believe that to participate at mass meant you had to do things at mass serve as a reader become an extraordinary minister become an altar server it focused on external activities rather than internal things like prayer now some of these things are okay but theyre not what the church really means by participation the church teaches that participation is primarily an internal thing like prayer its an awareness of the mystery being celebrated at mass and how it is connected to our daily lives does this make sense
7787159 its kind of a long story but when your mom and dad were little there were a lot of folks running around claiming to be experts on this sort of thing they said that to get people to participate we need to have them do as many external things as possible some of their ideas are still with us
7787160 it is but its getting better pope benedict is a great teacher and hes been spending a lot of time on the mass
7787161 good indeed lets try a quiz who is participating more at mass the mom holding a baby in the back of the church or the extraordinary minister in the front
7787162 people call them communion ministers or eucharistic ministers theyre supposed to be used in exceptional circumstances even though theyre used all the time
7787163 because of what we were just talking about the idea that participating means doing things external things at mass now back to my question who is participating more the mom or the extraordinary minister
7787164 of course now lets talk for a minute about the priest his role is to sanctify members of the laity what does sanctify mean
7787165 thats right to make something holy the priest serves the people by making them holy sanctifying them how does he do this

7787190 lets face it weve had different candidates in this race its disappointing when your candidate doesnt win
7787191 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7787192 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
7787193 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
7787194 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
7787195 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it

7787209 they are definitely the toughest opponents weve had in a champions league qualifier i know people expect us to get through but its not as if were playing a mickey mouse team
7787210 the belgian league has a lot of quality and their champions are used to getting into the group stages we had a tough match against anderlecht a few years ago so im not surprised liege caused us problems
7787211 they caught us a bit cold in the first leg but you have to remember that they had gone something like 30 games unbeaten in their own league and they are a club with european pedigree
7787212 we didnt play well and we know well have to improve at anfield everyone knows how important it is for our season to get into the group stage
7787213 its always a funny time for us to have such a massive game before weve got going in the season some of our results have reflected that
7787214 we lost at home to ak graz in the year we won the competition and had a narrow win in the last minute against maccabi haifa two years ago so anyone thinking well win comfortably knows thats very dangerous
7787215 i believe im at the top of my game right now and like any player i want to win things i dont want to look back on my career and think i only won the carling league cup
7787216 i want to push on and win more and thats one of the reasons why i came to liverpool another reason is the fact that ive always been a fan and if i could win something with this team it would be a dream come true

7787220 because wind and light conditions could be excluded as a common denominator determining the body axis orientation magnetic alignment is the most parsimonious explanation
7787221 the chinese nationalism has impressed me the most that has inspired me for 2010 knowing its canadas chance to do the same
7787222 very inspired by equestrian ian millar after nine olympics or 10 considering the boycott finally an olympic medal talk about perseverance us older guys need all the help we can get
7787223 i was actually jumping up and down in my apartment when simon whitfield triathlon made his huge comeback to win silver kyle shewfelt alexandre despatie blythe hartley ian millar simon whitfield and eric lamaze are just a few absolutely incredible athletes who have re ignited that excitement hope and desire in me for 2010
7787224 most amazing usain bolt obviously most inspirational simon whitfields heart and drive in the triathlon great moment that showed a real joy for sport and pride to represent canada adam kreek singing the anthem after their mens eight rowing win
7787225 im full on training harder than ever before more focused and now more inspired seeing cyclist jeannie longo ciprelli 50 of france come in fourth in the time trial and missing a medal by 1 6 seconds that tells me what i already know that im definitely not too old at 35
7787226 gymnast kyle shewfelt is a champion who inspired me beyond sport kyle succeeded against such tremendous odds his dedication hard work and above all his positive attitude have set an incredible example
7787227 the most inspiring performance for me simon whitfield to watch him be so patient and tactical throughout his race was amazing and then to watch him get dropped coming into the stadium area was heart wrenching his courage and sheer determination was absolutely incredible
7787228 i actually think that by watching these games it has really put me in the olympic spirit for 2010 i remember cheering like a banshee with teammate larisa yurkiw when ryan cochrane the swimmer earned his bronze medal
7787229 i live and breathe sport so being able to turn my tv on at 6 a m in the morning and have live action is my tv dreams coming true simon whitfield no question inspired me the most his will and determination was impressive
7787230 it was fantastic i learned a lot about myself as an athlete and as a person
7787231 i can bounce back i can rise from the ashes after a bad fall and i can get back up and keep going
7787232 my win was the peak after this really tough year to be able to win a medal and finally perform and be ready and confident at the right moment was really more than i could expect
7787233 theyve worked so hard and were so proud of them
7787234 i didnt get to go to beijing because i have to look after my dog and 15 year old
7787235 i hope we get this kind of ovation in four years
7787236 people just dont know if they are ready for the change candidate
7787237 our goal has been to reach out and tear down the walls of the convention
7787238 we understand that asking people to allow the county to raise taxes is never a popular thing but we think the timing is optimum

7787240 fashion is not something that exists in dresses only fashion is in the sky in the street fashion has to do with ideas the way we live what is happening
7787241 i dress for the image not for myself not for the public not for fashion not for men
7787242 fashion is only the attempt to realize art in living forms and social intercourse
7787243 fashion is a social agreement the result of a consensus of a large group of people
7787244 were losing our culture were losing our natural resources and were losing our health
7787245 so were kind of on a train thats going over a cliff and we just have to stop get out and find another way
7787246 the majority of americans are not in a position to engage in fine dining on a regular basis
7787247 very little substantive change has come to our poorest neighborhoods
7787248 i realized chez panisse has always been a slow food restaurant
7787249 i think that good pure affordable wholesome food should be available to everybody
7787250 and it should be a right and not a privilege
7787251 no sooner did we get the green revolution no sooner did the specter of mass starvation get pushed aside than we got this organic nonsense
7787252 i get a basic disdain for america and the american way of doing things from slow food
7787253 were building a stage on which a lot of organizations could bring their message and their hope for a more sustainable and more just food system

7787258 maybe the organism that were looking at right now in this outbreak might be adapted to some peculiar way to have a higher tolerance to the sanitation activities to the sanitation agents that are being used
7787259 we need to look very carefully at the effectiveness of what we consider to be acceptable programs in addressing this particular organism
7787260 normally one could expect that such activities would detect the organism but it will hide anywhere where you have a regular maintenance program for equipment combined with a regular sanitation program you should be able to cover this off the problem is the organism is coming in to the plant all the time and its able under normal circumstances to survive in the meat plant and grow we know that and maple leaf knows it too and the only thing to address it is to put in place programs that will protect us
7787261 it probably gets through quite a bit is there more we can do yes there is but there are limits
7787262 you cant build a reputation on what youre going to do

7787264 stop going for the easy buck and start producing something with your life create instead of living off the buying and selling of others
7787265 there has not been any real drastic change in the smuggling
7787266 the egyptians are basically working the same way today as they did before the cease fire went into effect
7787267 the cease fire is fragile and the defense establishment acts as if already tomorrow morning the reality will be completely different
7787268 we are investing in defenses for the towns and are drilling various scenarios unfortunately it is our responsibility to prepare for the worst case scenarios
7787269 the information which the accused had given to caroline amounted to disclosing serious illegal insider trading activity and also raised great concerns about the fire and the insurance
7787270 carolines possession of this information was potentially very damaging to the relationship between the accused and rene rivkin a relationship which he valued very very highly
7787271 sometimes he gets so angry its like he wants to kill me
7787272 hes under a lot of pressure sometimes i fear for my life with gordon
7787273 the only reasonable explanation for his knowledge is that he was there when she went over
7787274 the springboks will get worse if they continue in this way
7787275 mate no one in world rugby is playing the way their coach is talking about not successfully anyway
7787276 everyone has discipline policies and a procedure in their game the way he is talking is nonsense you cant just play an expansive wide game
7787277 this is still a very good squad of players most are even at their peak or approaching it so there is plenty of talent but what they need is the organisation and discipline
7787278 the hard thing for peter is that he has never coached professionally and this is one of the most difficult teams to coach
7787279 theyre attacking off everything and theyre going lateral not through defences you have to go through sides like australia and new zealand first
7787280 but he has to change his philosophy because it doesnt fit these players its not credible
7787281 peters big test now is to learn if he learns he can turn it around but if he continues to be stubborn he wont last long because his tactics wont work
7787282 if a company is doing badly then you blame the managing director so it is right and fair that the coach be held responsible
7787283 peter de villiers his management team and playing squad have my unequivocal backing
7787284 peters future is secure we are not in the business of sacking springbok coaches within three months of their first match
7787285 we continue to find the way to reach an agreement between israel and the palestinians
7787286 very heartened by the fact that the negotiations are serious and they are intensive
7787287 in fact i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together over this period of time
7787288 construction in the settlements has increased by a factor of 1 8 by comparison to the same period last year
7787289 the housing ministry initiated 433 new housing units during the period of january to may 2008 compared to just 240 units during the period january to may 2007
7787290 i would like to suggest to my partners not to use it as an excuse and i know they are not using it as an excuse but i understand their frustration sometimes
7787291 but at the end of the day the israeli governments policy is not to expand settlements not to build new settlements and not to confiscate palestinian land
7787292 there were some small activities but they will not influence the ability to negotiate nor the future of the future borders of the palestinian state
7787293 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and that anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7787294 and we will continue to press ahead to get agreement so that we know what is in israel and what is palestinian

7787343 starting today all of my thoughts will be reserved for a new medium something smaller something more intimate and something very personal an email list
7787344 why bother blogging if email list is a better option for making money online
7787345 for some people having a fry up with bacon and sausages might seem like a good way to start the day
7787346 but if you are doing this regularly then you are significantly increasing your risk of bowel cancer which is one of the most common cancers in the uk
7787347 only a third of people are aware of the link between processed meat and cancer which means two thirds of people are not in a position to make an informed choice about how much of it they eat
7787348 this is not a question of all or nothing because the more processed meat you eat the greater your risk
7787349 as well as the processed meat increasing the risk of bowel cancer fry ups also tend to be high in calories
7787350 we recommend people limit consumption of high calorie or energy dense foods because eating them regularly makes you more likely to gain weight
7787351 this is important because there is convincing evidence excess body fat increases risk of six different types of cancer
7787352 the sergeant discovered inside his truck a bullet proof vest two rifles ammunition walkie talkies and drugs
7787353 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads
7787354 the fact that barack obama is the first african american to become a nominee does raise some concerns
7787355 confident that there is no credible threat to candidate convention or city of denver
7787356 it is unknown whether the absence of a threat is because the group are in custody or because they were never frankly up to it

7787360 i am concerned about the length of time it took to notify the public about this escape
7787361 six have been characterized as where the listeria bacterium has been an underlying or contributing factor to the death
7787362 five are still under investigation in terms of determining the extent of the contribution by the bacteria to the death of the individuals
7787363 the one in b c is still a little bit controversial but it contributed to the death
7787364 it is important to note that all the suspect cases have been diagnosed with listeriosis but it is only via laboratory testing the genetic fingerprinting that we can determine if they are directly linked to this particular outbreak strain
7787365 we fully expect that both the numbers of suspected cases and confirmed cases will increase as this investigation continues and samples continue to be tested
7787366 i remind the public that if in doubt about any ready to eat meat its best to throw it out
7787367 this is an example of where our surveillance system worked
7787368 weve been very clear what the stakes are and what were looking for
7787369 i think that really communicates pretty clearly what we have suspected which is that theres no interest by the liberals to have a conversation about a legislative agenda for the fall
7787370 whats the rush the meeting is to be about the fall sitting of parliament the house doesnt return till sept 15
7787371 there is no crisis except the one being manufactured by harper weve never been told there was a time limit for this meeting other than it was to happen before the house reconvened
7787372 the facts dont support conservative spin that parliament doesnt work in fact harper is manufacturing a crisis when none exists three federal budgets have passed twenty nine bills have passed
7787373 were not asking for a blank cheque weve asked to have a conversation about what on the governments agenda if anything would you be willing to support so we can have a productive legislative session in the fall
7787374 the answer is theyre not even willing to have a conversation let alone agree on anything
7787375 it stretches all credibility to say that one doesnt have time in a three week period to take a phone call
7787376 if really in six weeks you cant get any agreement public or private you cant even have a conversation privately i think you have your answer
7787377 were not really optimistic about mr harpers wish to change direction
7787378 we dont have confidence in this government weve been opposing their policies and voted accordingly in the house of commons
7787379 we have been under threat of an election for at least the last two years from mr dion we cant govern this country under mr dions threats
7787380 being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun
7787381 external beauty is a gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7787382 hi guys my name is sister isabella i enjoy making candles teaching overseas praying helping the less fortunate hard work contemplating the universe and maybellines new define a brow eyebrow pencil please vote for me
7787383 this contest will be a way to show there isnt just the beauty we see on television but also a more discreet charm
7787384 you really think all nuns are old stunted and sad this isnt the case any more
7787385 do you really think nuns are all elderly straitlaced and funereal there are nuns from africa and latin america who are really very very lovely the brazilians particularly
7787386 who is this guy working on our behalf and could he please stop saying such creepy things to the media this is not going to help our cause
7787387 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7787388 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7787389 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7787390 we are indeed but you know what would be great if we could submit photographs and be judged by strangers on the internet
7787391 the concept of a beach convent is something that is appreciated by vacationers and the nuns themselves
7787392 ive played more of a ball playing role this year anyway so its just an extension of this
7787393 campo is definitely going to do the bulk of the kicking but we do have options
7787394 i can kick if we need something and glen buttriss has the ability out of dummy half as well
7787395 hes had an mri on it today so theyre just assessing if hell need surgery immediately or if we can nurse it through another week or two
7787396 just after the contact on the weekend we need to determine whether it needs surgery straight away
7787397 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7787398 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7787399 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7787400 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems
7787401 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president
7787402 were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states
7787403 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7787404 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1

7787407 i was holding the medal for three days to make sure its not a dream its real
7787408 if we can get people to even cut their trip in half so that were keeping cars out to where its a little less busy thats a winning strategy
7787409 but eliminating free parking at those facilities is giving people more encouragement to drive downtown
7787410 only a small proportion of the spaces generate revenue to offset maintenance and operating costs for the entire network
7787411 it may generate revenue but at the end of the day we want to make sure that were not expending money on lots but allowing them to pay for themselves
7787412 for some users monthly cost of transit could more than double
7787413 i thought i was a very even game up until they scored the way the first half went i was well pleased
7787414 we have three or four players who havent played for a while and missed a pre season and i had to throw them in and take a chance on them
7787415 the work rate was much better today and you couldnt fault the effort i thought we played okay
7787416 we played some excellent football tonight this is a difficult place to come so it is a bonus to come here and win
7787417 we tried to play a system where the players would be comfortable we wanted to have anderson playing centrally close to carlos tevez
7787418 we let paul scholes control the game and used darren fetchers energy

7787504 we want to be able to use him to make us better
7787505 we need him primarily on defense because he has become such a good cornerback hes the quarterback back there thats where we need him the most but if theres an opportunity to get him touches offensively were going to do that
7787506 i dont need to get all the accolades or publicity
7787507 my only focus is to help us win if i do that then i know im doing my job whatever the coaches want me to do is what ill do everything else will take care of itself

7787717 it really shook him up he and i both essentially went through high school and college fantasizing about christina applegate so at first he was really excited like dude i totally get to see christina applegate nude but i guess the trauma of realizing that he drove a dagger into the collective heart of men everywhere by cutting off the very things that helped him through the rough spots of puberty was just too much for him
7787718 it started out kind of funny actually she was lying there on the table unconscious he was joking around check it out im finally getting to touch kelly bundys boobs but then you could almost see a kind of black cloud of realization drift over him as i handed him the scalpel and he remembered the task at hand when it was all said and done he just stood there for awhile then screamed what have i done and ran out of the room crying

7787831 dengan mengibarkan bendera bintang kejora mereka akan mendapat perhatian dari pemerintah maupun pihak asing walaupun mereka tahu ancaman pengibaran bendera bintang kejora akan dijatuhi hukuman 15 sampai 20 tahun penjara sesuai kuhp pasal 106 tentang perbuatan makar dan pp nomor 77 tahun 2007
7787832 pemerintah jangan takut tentang kemerdekaan yang ada di papua sebab mereka tidak mempunyai struktur pengorganisasian parlemen dan tentara yang baik jadi pola pandang pemerintah harus diubah dalam menanggapi aspirasi rakyat papua

7787836 this convention provides a very important opportunity for the obama campaign to bond with the constituencies that supported hillary clinton
7787837 its not about barack or hillary its about bringing in the people here who voted for hillary rodham clinton senator obama and senator biden are without question qualified to do that

7787841 the german economy is encountering an increasingly more difficult situation
7787842 this is a big change in blubber and if it continues it could make it more difficult for the whales to survive it indicates there have been some big changes in their ecosystem
7787843 i dont think you could measure this by other non lethal means
7787844 this is the first time a long term decline in energy storage in minke whales has been demonstrated
7787845 explosive harpoons and a large calibre rifle in the event that death was not instantaneous
7787846 lots of dead bodies will provide robust data so if you kill lots of whales then you will be able to get some information the question is whether the benefits outweigh the number of whales killed and how they were killed scientific whaling is not about science and there is no pressing conservation need that requires it to be done
7787847 journals need to think very carefully about information that comes from this source different journals have different ethical standards
7787848 she is disappointed by the mindless tagging of so many buildings in tawa on tuesday night
7787849 it is particularly disappointing to see that the salvation army family store was hit ironically it was done the day before its free soup and bread lunch for the community
7787850 the time and effort that will be spent cleaning up this mess will deprive some of the needier members of the community of the salvation armys valuable help
7787851 it is fair to say they are still not living up to the terms of the cease fire agreement
7787852 over the weekend we have 48 sorties that have flown in with 774 short tons of materials
7787853 it should come as no surprise that a large majority of americans perceive senator obama as receiving more favorable media treatment compared to senator mccain obama is a fresh young and charismatic political figure any politician who is routinely compared to john f kennedy and bobby kennedy as obama has been will surely cultivate support among journalists this will change however once the nominating conventions are over and the general election campaign begins the euphoria will subside and we are likely to see more balanced coverage
7787854 when just 6 3 of those surveyed were unsure about the balance of media coverage for the candidates its a good indication it is obvious to americans but maybe not to the national media
7787855 more than two fifths 44 8 told our researchers that they would be very or somewhat likely to support a strong third party candidate if one emerged this has to be unsettling to both candidates
7787856 with respect to the poll concerning support for third parties it is not at all unusual to find a substantial portion of the electorate indicating displeasure with the nominees of the two major parties and a willingness to vote for a third party candidate this is a fairly typical finding
7787857 however when given the opportunity to actually vote for a third party candidate the vast majority of these disenchanted respondents will balk at the opportunity and cast their vote for either the democratic or republican candidate a good number of those persons polled who supported none of the above will also vote for one of the two major party candidates the united states has been a two party system since the beginning of the republic and this will not change any time soon

7787881 two years ago president bush set a new standard for global ocean protection when he established the papah naumoku kea marine national monument the largest marine protected area in the world in the northwestern hawaiian islands
7787882 monument or sanctuary designation by itself does not necessarily convey a high degree of protection and could allow a host of activities including commercial and recreational fishing and deep sea mining among others
7787883 one of the potential sites is in the waters off the northern mariana islands in the pacific
7787884 overfishing pollution coastal development climate change and other threats are pushing our oceans to the brink of collapse if the president moves ahead and designates these sites as fully protected no take reserves he will have preserved more of the worlds oceans in the form of reserves than any other person in history and will have led the nation into a new era of ocean conservation
7787885 the environmental impact to salmon and other species hits harder
7787886 my understanding is that when a person dies they go to be with the lord but the scripture says also that when jesus returns we will be raised and go to meet with him in the air how is it that we can be with him and then go to be with him in the air at the same time

7788008 the one in b c is still a little bit controversial but it contributed to the death
7788009 it is important to note that all the suspect cases have been diagnosed with listeriosis but it is only via laboratory testing the genetic fingerprinting that we can determine if they are directly linked to this particular outbreak strain
7788010 we fully expect that both the numbers of suspected cases and confirmed cases will increase as this investigation continues and samples continue to be tested

7788060 during everyday life we constantly evaluate social behaviour and this largely affects how we feel about ourselves and other people but the way we store and use information about our own and other peoples social behaviour are not well understood
7788061 this latest study used functional brain imaging to identify the circuits in the brain that underpin our ability to differentiate social behaviour that conforms to our values from behaviour that does not
7788062 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
7788063 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
7788064 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
7788065 by translating these basic cognitive neuroscience insights into clinical research we now have the potential to discover new key functional anatomical characteristics of the brain that may lie behind depressive disorders
7788066 the results will hopefully make an important contribution to our understanding of the causes of depression that will ultimately allow new approaches to find better treatments and prevention

7788097 as such low levels of ionising radiation is one of the smallest risks in the environment and causes a tiny amount of the spontaneous damage to dna in our bodies
7788098 it has led to unacceptable societal penalties as clearly demonstrated in the aftermath of the chernobyl catastrophe

7788100 i never once thought about eurostar when i was making this film
7788101 this is a very sensitive time for all our communities and we are working hard to ensure everyone is kept up to date with as much information as we can give
7788102 we will endeavour to carry out any searches as quickly as possible to minimise impact on the area concerned
7788103 online tools like these truly empower those who may be seeking health information for themselves and family caregivers to more easily navigate todays health care options
7788104 consumers can take advantage of these resources in order to maintain their independence as they age and live the most vibrant lives possible
7788105 aarp org is confident that these tools will enrich the lives of our current and prospective members
7788106 aarp chose these four offerings because we believe they are among the best of online consumer health care resources

7788108 cancer affects a large number of australians with an estimated 106 000 new cases of cancer diagnosed each year and with 1 in 2 men and 1 in 3 women diagnosed with cancer before the age of 85 the chances are high that most of us know someone who has been affected by this disease
7788109 gps cover the full spectrum of cancer care including prevention screening diagnosis referral follow up and providing psychosocial support to patients and their support partners
7788110 catching cancer early significantly improves patient outcomes and survival rates by increasing their understanding of the latest cancer screening methods gps can make a real difference to improving the rates of early detection and to saving lives
7788111 the best way you can protect yourself is to get to know your own body be informed and have regular health checks if you notice any unusual changes such as a lump in your breast or a spot growing on your skin see your doctor without delay
7788112 some cancers could be prevented by making positive lifestyle changes such as giving up smoking protecting yourself in the sun aiming for a healthy body weight being physically active choosing a balanced diet rich in fruit and vegetables and avoiding alcohol
7788113 people with an increased cancer risk due to family history or their lifestyle should talk to their gp about potential risks your gp is the best place to start with getting the right advice and screening tests its never too early to talk to your gp
7788114 there is evidence that some cancers are more common in less well off parts of our community
7788115 all people in australia deserve access to the best cancer screening and treatment whether they live in remote aboriginal and torres strait islander communities if they are living in immigration detention or in prison or if they are homeless general practitioners play a key role in extending cancer care to disadvantaged patients with complex needs
7788116 how can this movement now bring donors on board giventhatthey have so far shown little willingness to fund programs outside thetraditional purview of public health
7788117 people who drink alcohol need to be fully aware of the damage that can be done to their health by excess on this our two organisations agree
7788118 in our view the british medical association is wrong to press the government to deter the minority by punishing the majority with higher taxes that is also the view of the large majority of the public which overwhelmingly rejects your case for higher taxation
7788119 it is clear therefore that calls for higher taxes do not have public support on grounds either of fairness or effectiveness in fact piling more taxes on beer would drive more people away from pubs which remain the safest setting for the social pleasures associated with drinking responsibly
7788120 there are a large number of people drinking at a level that can damage their health many others who are not drinking excessively would be willing to pay more to protect public health
7788121 the new figures on junior doctor working hours are worrying
7788122 there is plenty of time for hospitals to address the challenges of junior doctors moving to a 48 hour week but it is important that the change is carefully managed so that the reduction in working hours does not negatively impact on the quality of junior doctor training or patient care we need to ensure that junior doctors can acquire the skills and experience required to practise safely within the new limit on working hours it may also be necessary for the length of time it takes to qualify as a consultant in some specialties to be increased particularly in surgical specialties
7788123 trusts owe it to patients to ensure that they implement what is essential health and safety legislation which is needed to protect employees from working excessive hours
7788124 this reflects the dollar cost to australians and the human cost to individuals
7788125 governments the food industry the health and education sectors and individuals need to take responsibility for australias bulging waistline
7788126 the factors that contribute to obesity are complex and diverse there are no quick fix solutions and the key to success will be in a multi faceted approach
7788127 it is vital that individuals are not stigmatized but that they are supported and afforded the dignity of what for some can be a very difficult issue
7788128 doctors play a vital role in early intervention but help for our overweight community must be backed up with government intervention public health programs changes to food marketing and advertising food labelling and taxation measures along with urban planning regulations to make leisure options more accessible for ordinary people are all vitally important
7788129 targets are important in order to measure success and we need the government action underpinning these goals in order to achieve or better those targets

7788141 it just came with his nature he was always for helping people do better
7788142 so many of the times i called him to seek his advice had to do with personnel issues he was so good with that his counsel was always to be kind to people and treat them the way you wanted to be treated
7788143 ive seen whats on tv and im not going to comment on it
7788144 i was unable to locate sgt bruss video we have searched everywhere for it we were in the process of changing out old cars for new cars and we couldnt find it
7788145 this makes it impossible for me to listen to how sgt bruss talked to you
7788146 some may be able to offer longer hours on four days of the week and potentially improve the access to patients
7788147 it wont damage the building or contents but it will make it uncomfortable
7788148 now that the u s breached the agreed points the north is compelled to take
7788149 we urge north korea to resume disablement measures at an early date
7788150 i think this represents the biggest crisis to the denuclearization process since the feb 13 agreement
7788151 the norths kim jong il may have decided that he wont negotiate with the bush administration any more
7788152 so and so guard forward has more all around skills than so and so center pf therefore so and so guard forward is greater
7788153 cest la monnaie qui dirige le monde cest la monnaie qui dirige la terre et quon le veuille ou non cest comme a on ne peut rien y faire
7788154 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
7788155 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
7788156 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
7788157 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain

7788161 dumpling man is a great cheap east village hot spot
7788162 you have been wiser today than usual and less anxious
7788163 you made the good choice of coming to suzies the only choice
7788164 oh im a purist with sushi i really dont like toppings on my nigiri
7788165 you should be paying us double for the privilege of eating here and paying 9 for a thimble of wine
7788166 i am not eating another hot dog ever on this trip
7788167 i enjoyed a pricey but genuinely fun celebratory meal at this location of gyu kaku with two of my best friends last month and i have to say
7788168 well it is a kewl drrty burrrrgrr place hidden in a facy hotel so its good rite
7788169 hmmm this is a pretty good burger and i could probably come again but im not dying to come back
7788170 5 stars because i was there for the yelp elite event last night and made the place look good

7788174 one dreaming alone it will be only a dream many dreaming together is the beginning of a new reality
7788175 we command the system calling all recievers we are noisy people for a better living
7788176 we command the system calling all recievers we are noisy people for a better living
7788177 we command the system calling all recievers we are noisy people for a better living
7788178 we command the system calling all recievers we are noisy people for a better living
7788179 the group continues to perform strongly and the outlook remains positive
7788180 we continue to make good progress with the integration of the alcan assets that we acquired in 2007
7788181 we are on track to deliver annual synergies of us1 1 billion a1 28 billion after tax from the end of 2009 considerably higher than our initial estimate of us600 million a695 73 million
7788182 rio tinto is in great shape and is getting stronger
7788183 there is no longer a case for taking 4 billion a year from the public to produce programmes they do not want or can obtain free elsewhere
7788184 the world has moved on since the days when the bbc was central to british life any modern government that fails to acknowledge this fact is quite simply defying the will of the people
7788185 corporate gigantism and belief in a unique moral mission have made the bbc what it is today and yet both are of vanishingly small concern to viewers and listeners
7788186 the bbc internally is not neutral about multiculturalism it believes in it and promotes diversity lets face up to that
7788187 it must seek respect not for what it is but for what it does
7788188 the bbcs remit is to produce a volume of high quality programmes with much reduced output its long tradition of producing fine programmes and a budget of 4 million a day it should be able to achieve it triumphantly
7788189 the english democrats are offering a fresh start and reject the clich ridden and spin politics of the past we offer the politics of a common national identity and common values our politics are riddled with spin and political correctness a vote for the english democrats is a vote for honest and plain speaking
7788190 there should be an immediate referendum on the eu lisbon treaty it is wholly wrong for labour to try to impose this treaty on us contrary to their own specific manifesto commitment that there should be a referendum the people of the republic of ireland have said no we want our say
7788191 there should be free residential car for the elderly as is available in scotland it is wrong that pensioners homes in england are being seized to pay for this
7788192 we also demand access to all nhs drugs not a
7788193 there should be an end to the unjustified subsidies to other parts of the uk we want a fair system for all
7788194 england can no longer sustain uncontrolled mass immigration it should be stopped it places an unacceptable strain on all our services all previous governments have allowed this situation to get out of control
7788195 the government should seek to protect society and not the criminals
7788196 there should be an english parliament with an english prime minister and government with at least the same powers as the scottish ones
7788197 the voters of haltemprice and howden have the chance to send a clear message to the government and the rest of the stale political establishment that the people of england are no longer prepared to be treated as second class citizens within the uk let us put englands interests first
7788198 i am convinced that standing still is not an option the present arrangements are producing growing resentment all over the united kingdom particularly in england
7788199 a vote for joanne and the english democrats is a positive vote for the people of haltemprice and howden it is a vote for england and for an english parliament first minister and government for england
7788200 i will impress upon them the need to avoid prejudicing the process which we must now undertake in ireland
7788201 accord us the time we need to play our part in understanding last weeks vote
7788202 one of the main goals will be to calm the europeans down and not inflame the situation either in the eu or back at home any further
7788203 it will be made clear to the eu partners that it is politically impossible for ireland to have a rerun
7788204 i think you have excellently designed institutions for the budget process in an independent state or a state with substantial fiscal autonomy
7788205 barnett is unsustainable in the long run it is neither efficient nor equitable
7788206 it gives perverse incentives to the devolved administrations their block grant is a function of a number they cannot control
7788207 in turn their decisions have consequences which the uk government cannot fully control
7788208 it probably derives not from greater need but from the more credible threat to the union of the united kingdom that they pose
7788209 prof mcleans evidence points to one of devolutions fundamental flaws that we are spending money without direct responsibility for raising it
7788210 it is time to look again at how we fund our policy priorities
7788211 we may have to say well look were not happy with this situation here are some of the powers wed like to have back but we cant give you that referendum on the lisbon treaty because its already been put in place across the rest of europe
7788212 mutterings about regime change used to be confined to the fringes of the party but now there is a more widespread view that gordon will have to go unless he can win back public support
7788213 tamsin delivers for crewe and nantwich you told tamsin your concerns she put them directly to the chancellor she stood up for you
7788214 i think you will find he is not the type of lawyer he claims to be
7788215 it would not surprise us if labour was stooping to this level its entire campaign has been marked by mean spirited stunts and dirty tricks
7788216 carter tells anyone who will listen that james is the best thing since sliced bread
7788217 one way of unseating him would be through a war of attrition with relentless carefully placed attacks laying the ground for a delegation of elder statesmen the men in suits
7788218 asked what he would be in another life it would be a salesman car dealer pr guy estate agent and worst of all a foxtons estate agent
7788219 government in the uk is now so large diverse and complex that it is impossible for anyone to manage effectively let alone by ministers with no prior experience of management and little in depth understanding of the work carried out by their departments government today tries to do too much and consequently fails the structure of government needs to change if we hope to see better value and significant improvements in our public services
7788220 do you think that regeneration is adding a new wing to your mansion
7788221 have you and your tory mates on the council been soft on yobs and failed to make our streets safer
7788222 flatters some of the most chauvinistic and backward looking parts of british society
7788223 is a small price to pay for saving the union
7788224 we are worried about the reports of ken drinking too much if we lost london it would be a political disaster and gordon knows that
7788225 in my view ken livingstone would do a better job if he drank less i fear we have an alcohol fuelled mayoralty
7788226 well im concerned about the amount im drinking because its nothing like enough
7788227 the english are awakening to the unfairness of the barnett formula and to the democratic deficit in the way in which we are governed
7788228 come the three corners of the world in arms and we shall shock them nought shall make us rue if england to itself do rest but true
7788229 look if england got its own parliament and the union broke up what would happen to all the scottish people living in england and all the english people living in scotland
7788230 the truth the whole truth and anything but the truth
7788231 in some of the more heavily populated urban areas of the country family life is quite frankly in meltdown or completely unrecognisable
7788232 in some areas of the country even including the more urban parts of the sleepy west in which i operate family life in the old sense no longer exists
7788233 so i suggest the general collapse of ordinary family life because of the breakdown of families in this country is on a scale depth and breadth which few of us could have imagined even a decade ago
7788234 what is certain is that almost all of societys social ills can be traced directly to the collapse of the family life
7788235 most children and young people in england today are safe healthy and achieve well
7788236 the new brownvilles will be the same old projects that developers have been trying to squeeze through planning for ages greenwashed to suit the zeitgeist commuter dormitories with low energy knobs on
7788237 immigration is responsible for at least 70 per cent of the uks projected population increase which will take the uk from 61 million today to 85 million by 2081
7788238 the environmental consequences of such a massive population rise are alarming they include loss of countryside and green space and all the psychological stresses that come with high population densities overcrowding and loss of tranquillity
7788239 the alternative vote has many attractions including the fact that you have to get 50 plus one in that constituency therefore you have a greater legitimacy
7788240 it should not be about parties choosing a system that will most advantage themselves its about a voting system that delivers democracy for all of us
7788241 i dont understand how it can cause offence it is our country after all
7788242 home office policy precludes applications with tattoos on lower arm hand face or neck that are prominent which may cause offence and or invite provocation from the public or colleagues
7788243 a family who arent of english origin who see england on your arm could feel you might discriminate against them
7788244 we live in a diverse society and try to ensure we give everybody equality
7788245 but im now looking at other options like the fire service or prison service
7788246 this tattoo was clearly visible as it does not meet our rigorous standards his application was rejected
7788247 i expect they will want to ensure that the same type of collateral for central bank loans is taken here as it is by the fed and european central bank
7788248 i think the issue here is much more about ensuring that as peaks and troughs hit central banks are prepared to act and provide liquidity if liquidity is required
7788249 the bank of england is very keen to ensure that we have good strong confidence in our market after all weve got good strong banks
7788250 make it clearer what it means to be a citizen
7788251 practical measures that may help enhance a sense of shared belonging
7788252 my report makes a range of proposals that touch every stage of an individuals life my proposals are intended to promote the meaning and significance of citizenship within modern britain
7788253 in terms of a british national day what may be beneficial is a new public holiday to celebration the bond of shared citizenship
7788254 it can be a pledge of commitment to the country it can be a statement of what the rights and responsibilities of citizens are
7788255 we already teach schoolchildren what citizenship means but it would make sense to have a coming of age ceremony which marks the moment they move from being a student of citizenship to being a real citizen in themselves
7788256 a half baked idea that should be left to go mouldy
7788257 i see this as an empty gesture to ask 16 year olds to troop into a hall and like americans put their hands on their heart and take an oath of allegiance is risible
7788258 we dont support it and neither do the vast majority of parents teachers and children in scotland
7788259 there is corruption in any government there is always corruption its bad when it is more than 15 per cent
7788260 only people in the world can read this can you
7788261 la inspecci n tendr a que ser m s rigurosa y exigente

7788270 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
7788271 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia

7788276 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
7788277 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
7788278 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
7788279 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido

7788282 la gran mayor a de las comunidades desea el d alogo
7788283 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

7788285 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
7788286 moderation in temper is always a virtue but moderation in principle is always a vice
7788287 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
7788288 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
7788289 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
7788290 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
7788291 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
7788292 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
7788293 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
7788294 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
7788295 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
7788296 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
7788297 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
7788298 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
7788299 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
7788300 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
7788301 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
7788302 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
7788303 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
7788304 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
7788305 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
7788306 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
7788307 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
7788308 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
7788309 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
7788310 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
7788311 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
7788312 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
7788313 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
7788314 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
7788315 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
7788316 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
7788317 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
7788318 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
7788319 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
7788320 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
7788321 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
7788322 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
7788323 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
7788324 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
7788325 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
7788326 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
7788327 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
7788328 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
7788329 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
7788330 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
7788331 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
7788332 the human race has improved everything except the human race adlai stephenson
7788333 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
7788334 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine
7788335 try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value

7788338 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7788339 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7788340 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7788341 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7788342 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7788343 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7788344 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7788345 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7788346 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7788347 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre

7788578 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7788579 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7788580 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7788581 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7788582 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7788583 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7788584 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7788585 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7788586 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7788587 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7788588 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7788589 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7788590 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7788591 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7788592 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7788593 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7788594 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7788595 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7788596 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7788597 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7788598 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7788599 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7788600 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7788601 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7788602 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7788603 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7788604 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7788605 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7788606 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7788607 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7788608 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7788609 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7788610 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7788611 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7788612 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7788613 a clear breach of the rules of filming from the gallery
7788614 the public has a right to see how their elected representatives behave and perform in parliament warts and all
7788615 mps have and often use all sorts of items and props in the debating chamber anyone sitting in the public galleries can see that so why cant other members of the public see that via television
7788616 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7788617 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7788618 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7788619 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7788620 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7788621 there was no warning we werent coming at them they were coming at us
7788622 we must remain nonviolent we must have the high moral ground
7788623 theres a powerful police presence here the chill of 1968 is in the air of denver
7788624 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7788625 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7788626 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7788627 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7788628 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7788629 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7788630 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7788631 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7788632 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7788633 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7788634 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7788635 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7788636 i think its no secret and i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think that settlement activity is helpful
7788637 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7788638 the peace process is not and should not be affected by any kind of settlement activities
7788639 i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together
7788640 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7788641 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7788642 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7788643 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7788644 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7788645 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7788646 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7788647 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done

7788661 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7788662 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7788663 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7788664 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years

7788672 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7788673 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7788674 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7788675 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7788676 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7788677 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7788678 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7788679 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7788680 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7788681 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
7788682 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7788683 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7788684 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7788685 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7788686 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7788687 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7788688 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7788689 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7788690 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7788691 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7788692 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7788693 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7788694 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7788695 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7788696 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7788697 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7788698 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers

7788700 wenn es sein muss f hren wir einen politischen kreuzzug
7788701 schreck lass nach haben wir was verpasst stehen lafontaines truppen unterst tzt von gr nen regimentern schon auf giesings h hen bereit zum marsch auf die bayerische staatskanzlei die csu jedenfalls ordnet generalmobilmachung an chef erwin huber ruft die seinen zum kreuzzug gegen die roten socken auf und g nther beckstein beschuldigt bayerns gr ne einen frontalen angriff auf die christliche leitkultur und die gl ubigen christen zu f hren die erregungszust nde auf dem tandem wirken merkw rdig aufgesetzt so als wolle die csu in den letzten tagen vor der wahl hastig die wertedebatte nachholen die sie seit stoibers sturz hat schleifen lassen
7788702 zwar haben huber und ministerpr sident g nther beckstein am montag im kampf gegen die linkspartei wieder einmal einigkeit demonstriert aber es war nicht zu berh ren dass beckstein die kreuzzug losung seines tandempartners f r einen auf gut bayerisch ausgemachten schmarrn h lt und zum herunterstufen des themas linke mahnt denn offensichtlich ist mit dem kreuzritter erwin der fr here generalsekret r und wadenbei er durchgegangen wenn man sich einmal in etwas hineingesteigert hat wird oft bersehen dass die probleme und anliegen der menschen ganz woanders liegen schlie lich d rften selbst gl hende csu anh nger schwierigkeiten haben zu glauben dass der kommunismus ausgerechnet im freistaat vor der t r steht
7788703 in bayern wird die csu auch ohne die spd regieren k nnen was aber wenn die bundestagswahl 2009 nur eine wiederauflage der gro en koalition zulie e das b ndnis w rde angesichts der aufgerissenen gr ben keine weitere legislaturperiode berleben aber auch die bayerischen christsozialen m ssen sich fragen ob die sozialdemokraten tats chlich nur n tzliche idioten f r die lafontaine und gysi j nger sind wie es ihre generalsekret rin behauptet es ist ja nicht so dass die spd wegen der linkspartei nicht mehr gebraucht w rde im gegenteil sie ist eine zwar wackelnde aber wichtige demokratische bastion gegen den sich breit machenden linken populismus
7788704 die warnung vor einem linksruck z hlt seit eh und je zum wahlkampfrepertoire der csu auch liefert der hessische wortbruch der spd ja jede menge stoff um die gefahr eines langfristigen rot roten b ndnisses an die wand malen zu k nnen die csu w re t richt wenn sie dieses megathema links liegen lie e dar ber muss auch in einem landtagswahlkampf gesprochen werden wer wei vielleicht geht die taktische rechnung hubers auf nur je h rter die csu austeilt je mehr sie sich auf dieses eine thema st rzt desto deutlicher kommen auch ihre nervosit t und der mangel an einer inhaltlichen wahlkampfbotschaft zum vorschein
7788705 nur noch drei von zehn b rgern sehen die spd als die partei der sozialen gerechtigkeit von den zur linken abgewanderten fr heren spd w hlern sind sogar fast 90 prozent der berzeugung dass die sozialdemokraten nicht mehr ausreichend f r soziale belange eintreten es ist dieses meinungsbild das die spd zur kehrtwende auf dem agendakurs veranlasst hat die sogkraft der linken geht jedoch ber die spd hinaus die linksdrift hat auch die union erfasst statt offensiv f r die nachweisbaren erfolge der agendapolitik zu werben ben sich union und spd in der kleinm tig opportunistischen anpassung an den linkspopulismus deutschland ist drauf und dran seine wieder erreichte st rke zu verspielen

7788712 man darf skeptisch sein ob die russische regierung die unabh ngigkeit wirklich will aber die situation hat sich so entwickelt dass medwedjew praktisch keine andere wahl hat
7788713 das liegt nicht unbedingt im russischen interesse russland h tte diesen konflikt weiter in seinen internationalen verhandlungen nutzen k nnen jetzt muss sich moskau wirklich positionieren und verantwortung bernehmen
7788714 die s dosseten haben zwei mal per referendum ihre eigene staatlichkeit bekr ftigt ein teil der ossetischen bev lkerung pl diert f r eine vereinigung mit der russischen republik nordossetien
7788715 bislang hatte putin immer gesagt die anerkennung einer sezession k me nicht infrage weil man nicht den fehler machen wolle den der westen mit der anerkennung des kosovos gemacht habe nach dem krieg hat sich die haltung jedoch auch innerhalb der russischen regierung deutlich verh rtet
7788716 this race will only be influenced by being hit in the pocket
7788717 the united states says jewish settlements in the occupied west bank threaten any peace between israel and the palestinians yet it also encourages americans to help support settlers by offering tax breaks on donations
7788718 operates in concert with the community there to assess their needs and respond in kind
7788719 dozens of new families can now come live in hebron only if we renovate this building quickly
7788720 thats true but the u s government has no right to use political considerations when judging humanitarian and non profit needs the right of jews to live in hebron or new york should be protected
7788721 tomorrow the president may be in favour of it settlements and that would put all the non profits at the mercy of politics
7788722 we are not a political organisation we are doing humanitarian work and were doing humanitarian work in judea and samaria
7788723 injecting extraneous political issues into what should be a purely humanitarian issue will open a pandoras box for every charitable organisation in the united states
7788724 government budgets would not suffice to create all the services and facilities that the pioneering residents of ariel would need
7788725 we dont deal with politics we deal only with the welfare of the people that is what the irs demands
7788726 the irs is not involved in politics let the state department deal with politics
7788727 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado

7788732 das ist ein herber r ckschlag wir haben nicht damit gerechnet dass der ifo index erneut so deutlich zur ckgeht
7788733 daraus ergeben sich keine guten aussichten f r das zweite halbjahr die wahrscheinlichkeit einer rezession ist gestiegen
7788734 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7788735 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7788736 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7788737 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7788738 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7788739 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power

7788756 this is the most sickening election they attack me saying i am pro jewish which is an act of desperation
7788757 we fear fraud we are not happy with the ballot list
7788758 its not anwar versus the other candidate its anwar versus the entire government machinery
7788759 most of the core supporters of keadilan are factory workers my concern is the turnout and its too low for comfort
7788760 from our exit poll figures and what we are tracking anwar is safely leading in the polls and i think that it is right to say about 61 percent
7788761 we are still not declaring victory as we will wait for the official election results from the election commission
7788762 we are expecting anwars win to be as big as when wan azizah contested but we think that it will be less in terms of absolute numbers due to it being a working day for many
7788763 i will vote for anwar he represents the voice of the people god willing he will win
7788764 i have no more faith in umno because theres corruption and abuse of power
7788765 did i know that people all over town were getting sick and dying
7788766 i told them now you know we dont deal in rumors around here
7788767 people come from all over the place to eat there
7788768 from tulsa from arkansas from missouri sometimes by the busload
7788769 to this minute i have not heard one word from the state not one word from the county
7788770 nobodys telling us anything and were the ones caught in the middle of all this
7788771 i walked into a waiting room full of familiar faces
7788772 i thought to myself this thing is about to blow up into a very big deal and now it has
7788773 there isnt any evidence that this is where this man got sick
7788774 its really been damaging for the family the family is devastated and their prayers are with this mans family
7788775 words cannot express how utterly devastated the family is that this gentleman has passed away i cant tell you how crushed and saddened they are by all of this
7788776 we have absolutely no reason whatsoever to suspect that anything is wrong with our drinking water
7788777 the last thing we want is for people to panic
7788778 the water is safe to drink in locust grove the food is safe to eat
7788779 this is a disaster for the whole town of locust grove
7788780 i would say the whole town is depressed everybody is in a daze
7788781 i think anybody that was up to speed on the dynamics of the trade that went through i mean i didnt really have a whole heap of say with what went on so if people sort of bear that in mind i think theyll go easy on me
7788782 they wouldnt want to be sitting next to my mum if they boo though because they could end up with a lap of chips or something
7788783 as ive sort of showed that i can be a consistent performer
7788784 around 700 800 houses have been damaged people are somehow managing to live on wooden logs and rooftops many rooftops are also damaged those people dont know where to go
7788785 no arrangements have been made we live here only near the river we drink its water when we feel thirsty even though people die because of this river

7788788 obama has proven hes willing to turn on anyone just to be president hes not black hes biracial and he wasnt even raised by black people barack doesnt embody the values and characteristics we as black people are raised with
7788789 one drop of black blood and youre black the truth is every african american is biracial go back far enough and youll find the massah was in the slave quarters
7788790 single parent households high school dropouts the statistics are there for everybody to see we have to confront that head on
7788791 biden was trying to be the nominee then if baracks cool with him then i am and joe biden can be the muscle guy
7788792 the stereotype is that all black men are angry that if hes not angry hes not passionate
7788793 then in the final analysis the piece that makes us a little different is our institutions being able to retain those local packages and the revenue that is generated by them in addition to the revenue generated by the cbs and espn packages took it over the top
7788794 avoids challenges of distribution that have been faced by startup networks such as the big ten network and the nfl network
7788795 plus the money is great for the schools and the conference it shows the value of what we sell and the affinity of whats clearly the most lucrative tv package
7788796 the bottom line here is that fans of sec football will have more access to more games and better distribution than theyve ever had in the past
7788797 it was just great to meet him and meet people you usually see on tv like tennis no1 rafael nadal and roger federer
7788798 for me michael phelps is a real inspiration and someone you really look up to
7788799 thats her business and now that were friends its not something i have to worry about
7788800 shes a mature girl and makes her own decisions and were just enjoying being friends and thats something you just cant take away
7788801 there is no way that a country of 63 million like thailand will let a group of five people form a street gang to seize control
7788802 i wont yield my cabinet wont yield the military and the police wont yield
7788803 i wont leave until there is a political change if you want me to leave you will have to kill me and take my body out of here
7788804 we need to have greater clarity that this government is going to be around next year
7788805 they shouted get out get out at us repeatedly all 150 of us were rounded up for a short while before police arrived and talked them down to the ground floor
7788806 the army will not launch a coup the people can be assured

7788809 lets face it weve had different candidates in this race its disappointing when your candidate doesnt win
7788810 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7788811 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7788812 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7788813 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7788814 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7788815 were in the age of modern communications and you cant find a half hour in that period of time to either sit down or talk by phone that isnt schedules not linking up that is a decision thats being made not to talk
7788816 there is no crisis except the one being manufactured by harper
7788817 weve never been told there was a time limit for this meeting other than it was to happen before the house reconvened as it was meant to be about this sitting of parliament
7788818 this is an invention by mr harper to try to trigger an election before he loses the by elections
7788819 this is full improvisation and it shows panic from the prime minister
7788820 itll be straightforward and the bill will not be open to misinterpretation
7788821 the government and the prime minister have been very clear on this that we are not reopening the debate on abortion
7788822 youre going off in a direction the olympics dont go
7788823 we chose athletes it didnt matter what language they spoke what religion they were what colour they were

7788827 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7788828 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself were we all there shed ask softly
7788829 watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it
7788830 she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 percent cast iron damage proof
7788831 a swim on part in the goldfish bowl a memoir
7788832 the fear is given our track record that the sailing will not be so smooth
7788833 we may return to the hoary days of the past which discredited the political class as a whole and prepared the ground for an extra constitutional intervention
7788834 this is a threat that looms over our heads permanently
7788835 it would be premature to think that the housing market will now start to recover because overall approval activity continues to be very low
7788836 disparar contra obama desde una posici n muy favorable con un fusil a una distancia de 750 metros
7788837 dado que este asunto est siendo investigado poco se puede decir por ahora pero s que estamos absolutamente seguros de que no hay ninguna amenaza cre ble sobre el candidato la convenci n o la poblaci n de colorado
7788838 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and south ossetia this is about getting russian troops out
7788839 i do not think one can separate politics and religion
7788840 i am an ecletic dyanic christo wiccan by religion and my religion permits a way of life for me
7788841 in my spare time i practise the wicca ritual from a book called inner magic a guide to witchcraft by ann marie gallagher it is probably undisputed that people who read this article will be shocked to be confronted with this reality because it is societys way that if people fail to put you in a box in terms of religion you are labelled a satanist which would be prejudiced and false in this regard
7788842 pagans at rhodes tend to hide who they are and just for interest sake hang out a lot at cow moon theory
7788843 they have accepted that now and today my religion is a way to understand myself as a pagan in the context of the world
7788844 i have a problem with the word religion because the word means nothing to me but faith is everything to me
7788845 there are a lot of stereotypes to people that belong to the jehovahs witness denomination
7788846 you hear crazy things like j ws bewitch people brainwash people that we dont pray or that we bury people like dogs all these are highly offensive and
7788847 although i am hindu i fall under the sanathan category
7788848 the sanathan dharma religion believes in the theory of karma which is the relationship of cause and effect they believe that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction karma is relative to religions like buddhism which also stems from hinduism i am a devout hindu or sanathan and keep to the rituals and practices of my religion i dont eat beef because in my religion we revere the cow as a source of life we see her as a mother now would you eat your mother
7788849 kinda screwed up my life back in the early 2000s
7788850 i loathe meg ryan loathe her naomi wolfs culture deserves meg ryan she is sandra dee reborn but without sandra dees talent for comedy she is so superficial she used to be on as the world turns i hated her on that and she has been doing the same goddamned act since then the woman has two facial expressions okay the fact that she is one of the great actresses of our culture right now is a testament to our poverty to our sexual poverty
7788851 evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt
7788852 trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
7788853 point blank black on black murder and the guy couldnt decide whether he was going to shoot us or not
7788854 i managed to flip out of my crib almost as soon as i learned to walk
7788855 i see cars over there going like 60 miles per hour and im sitting here doing maybe six miles an hour and i said no uh huh theres this huge grassy median between us im in a jeep and im going over so across i go and i realize ive done it right in front of a camera crew and i hear on the radio oh no what is she doing this is how accidents happen and i look in the rearview mirror and im the pied piper everybody behind me we all know that we need to get over there and so im leading hundreds of cars over the grass
7788856 what would happen to the world if all human beings disappeared how nature would come back and take over again
7788857 essentially writing short stories and then adding visuals to those stories
7788858 and i was the first victim he was a serial rapist i know of one woman who died im alive now only because i think he believed he succeeded in killing me he hit me in the back of the head with the butt of a gun then he strangled me to the point that my contact lenses popped out of my eyes
7788859 i had been bartending dating musicians leading a sort of random life i really felt after the attack like id been given a second chance that id better do more with my life than what i was doing so i went looking for an mfa program id been writing on my own on my days off from bartending writing in longhand in spiral notebooks a whole novel its a little harder than you first assume and i thought i could use some help with this i ended up at the university of new orleans
7788860 a good looking man who was going to be studying writing
7788861 they married in 1995 and she was happy to change her name from bueg which no one could pronounce or spell to boyden
7788862 i fell in love with the entire discipline of circus
7788863 i went down to harbourfront and trained got put in their performance troupe and when we returned to new orleans i started an all female trapeze troupe there
7788864 that ive had the chance to live life rather than just sit in an attic room somewhere and write about a writer writing

7788889 the nokia n79 packs cutting edge technology into a compact design a characteristic of the iconic nseries that allows people to discover create and share their passions with others
7788890 it has been designed for those who want a device that is as appealing as it is powerful and comes with interchangeable covers that have automatically matching screen themes this balance of performance and style means that it is a powerful and defining step forward from the popular and very successful nokia n72 and nokia n73
7788891 the risks of bidding without russian approval were obvious of course the indians took precautions before embarking on this
7788892 we joined the coalition with full sincerity for the restoration of democracy unfortunately all the promises were not honored
7788893 its old media meets new media its new media meets new media im just here to meet somebody
7788894 i just wonder if bloggers can have as much impact when they are in the same place as the big dogs
7788895 the bottom line is that people no longer want to be spectators technology allows us to essentially become participants
7788896 i just asked for free food free wifi and free beer
7788897 this time we have delegates uploading videos from the convention center
7788898 were losing our culture were losing our natural resources and were losing our health
7788899 so were kind of on a train thats going over a cliff and we just have to stop get out and find another way
7788900 the majority of americans are not in a position to engage in fine dining on a regular basis
7788901 very little substantive change has come to our poorest neighborhoods
7788902 i realized chez panisse has always been a slow food restaurant
7788903 i think that good pure affordable wholesome food should be available to everybody
7788904 and it should be a right and not a privilege
7788905 no sooner did we get the green revolution no sooner did the specter of mass starvation get pushed aside than we got this organic nonsense
7788906 i get a basic disdain for america and the american way of doing things from slow food
7788907 were building a stage on which a lot of organizations could bring their message and their hope for a more sustainable and more just food system
7788908 you see barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to
7788909 you see thats just not how he sees the world he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future he knows that that thread is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7788910 we say john mccain has the experience of being wrong
7788911 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7788912 and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7788913 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7788914 john mccain has spent more than 25 years in washington voting against womens freedom
7788915 and has pledged to appoint justices to the supreme court who will overturn roe v wade
7788916 know that this son of a single mom will stand up for the dreams of our daughters and i know that john mccain wont
7788917 a sturdy woman and an eternal optimist who understood that parents are our first and best teachers
7788918 in middle school your parents do more for you but in high school its all on you
7788919 to go from being big man on campus in middle school to little man on campus in high school is traumatic
7788920 at 14 students are right on the cusp some of them are still children you see girls carrying around stuffed animals and a lot of kids still watch cartoons but they are also in puberty and part of that means trying to assert themselves and forge an identity
7788921 theres a lot of pressure to figure out not only who you are but where you want to go in life
7788922 any point of transition in our lives is a major challenge if you think of marriage or divorce or having children going to college starting a new job any time we reach a point of transition we need support
7788923 the key to high school success is a strong ninth grade foundation
7788924 students who get off to a weak start easily get discouraged and have a lot of trouble in 10th and 11th grade its all about engagement and connection kids need to feel connected to school
7788925 they probably do like you but they are being tough on you because they want you to pass
7788926 you cant go to the counselors and say you want to switch a class because the teacher doesnt like you they wont buy that but dont be afraid to ask your teachers for help thats their job
7788927 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
7788928 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
7788929 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
7788930 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
7788931 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7788932 i couldnt believe it in front of me was reams of extremely confidential information about thousands and thousands of people

7788936 can i ask what sort of advice and help you are providing
7788937 ambassador khalilzad had planned to meet socially with zardari during his personal vacation
7788938 but because zardari is now a presidential candidate ambassador khalilzad postponed the meeting after consulting with senior state department officials and zardari himself
7788939 why do i have to learn about this from asif after its all set up
7788940 we have maintained a public line that we are not involved in the politics or the details we are merely keeping in touch with the parties can i say that honestly if youre providing advice and help please advise and help me so that i understand whats going on here
7788941 it is not possible to conduct coherent foreign policy if senior officials are freelancing
7788942 i know that zardaris interest in becoming president has been clear for quite some time
7788943 whoever our guy is isnt going to be the only guy in town and if we go into it with that view well bump up against a lot of other guys in a senior pakistani official said that the relationship between mr
7788944 mr khalilzad being a political animal understood the value of reaching out to s political leadership long before the bureaucrats at the state department realized this would be useful at a future date
7788945 did not make policy or change policy he just became an alternate channel
7788946 our very clear policy is that the pakistanis have to work out any domestic political questions for themselves
7788947 the pakistani elections are an internal matter for the pakistani people

7788951 pooling data on vocal imitation vocal convergence and compensation for noise suggests a wider cross species distribution of vocal production learning among mammals than has been generally appreciated
7788952 animal communication has been a major emphasis in animal behaviour and comparative psychology for many decades
7788953 however in recent years we have gone beyond the straightforward analysis of dyadic interactions between two individuals we now consider the role of eavesdropping deception and noisy environments in shaping signals and investigate how animals deploy them in various contexts
7788954 bojans father is my great friend i have spoken to him before about the possibility that bojan plays for serbia because that would be a great honour for us
7788955 he is a boy with a huge talent he is not only a great player though but also a good person that is well education and knows his culture
7788956 any player would want to play for arsenal of course but for inler this may be perhaps a little early maybe a season too early
7788957 certain pieces of it equipment have been removed from a secure area we are seeking to recover this equipment which apparently contained customer data we take customer privacy and data security very seriously
7788958 darwin strongly encouraged the search for fossils but it proved disappointing
7788959 although geological research have undoubtedly revealed the existence of a past many links that have already moved closer to each other many forms of life they do not between species present and past species all infinite gradations and insensitive that calls my theory and this is without doubt the most serious objection that one can oppose him
7788960 it is undoubtedly difficult to speculate on what many gradations structures have been perfected
7788961 were fortunate to not only have found this gene but to be able to do something about it
7788962 there is nothing i would like more than to compete at a home olympics
7788963 it is a huge motivational factor to compete at london
7788964 ill have two months off to relax and switch off and spend some time discussing my future with the coaching staff i am sure i will keep going i will make an announcement soon in terms of what i will definitely do
7788965 unless you fall off it is not a high impact sport
7788966 if you look after yourself and you have good health no injuries and are motivated you can continue
7788967 it is going to take a long time at home and in the peace and quiet for the whole experience to sink in
7788968 it has been an amazing three or four days since the finish line in my last event it has just been mad and i think ive had about 10 hours sleep in that time
7788969 it is not often we get this kind of attention and i am loving it
7788970 i will have some time off but will then think what is going to motivate me what is going to be the real challenge

7789033 enough is enough as the police know amy is a drug addict and she has now been caught twice on film taking illegal drugs they should arrest her and put her behind bars

7789044 this guy is a complete clown stupid injury prone bad investment
7789045 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
7789046 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
7789047 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
7789048 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
7789049 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
7789050 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
7789051 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them
7789052 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
7789053 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party

7789059 hes had a slight hamstring strain so it would be unfair to

7789061 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
7789062 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
7789063 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
7789064 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
7789065 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
7789066 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
7789067 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
7789068 robinhos cycle in spain has come to an end and he is looking forward to a new project
7789069 clearly such details should never have been included in the hard drive of the computer offered for sale on ebay we fully expect mr chapman to hand it back to graphic data as soon as possible
7789070 we will of course work with graphic data to establish how it came to be available for sale on our site
7789071 graphic data has confirmed to us that one of their machines appears to have been inappropriately sold on via a third party as a result historical data relating to credit card applications from some of our customers and data from other banks were not removed
7789072 we take this issue extremely seriously and are working to resolve this regrettable loss with graphic data as a matter of urgency
7789073 we were arrested and taken to a university for questioning we were held for nearly 24 hours without any sleep and having interrogation of up to about eight hours
7789074 then we were moved to a detention centre and before we were allowed any sleep we had another 12 hours of interrogation
7789075 they seemed to have decided to really clamp down on protesters

7789078 i had a loving husband i had a loving son and they loved each other they were friends they were buddies its just this horrible illness i dont know what goes through peoples heads

7789095 he venido a unirme a ustedes para cambiar estados unidos recuperar su futuro elevarnos hacia nuestros mejores ideales y elegir a barack obama
7789096 con barack obama el mundo comienza de nuevo la esperanza vuelve a alzarse y el sue o sigue con vida
7789097 ha hecho la vida mejor para todos aqu y en todo el mundo
7789098 hasta ahora no hab a tenido a nadie que me inspirara del modo en que la gente me dice que mi padre les inspir a ellos pero ahora s lo tengo barack obama
7789099 why the keyword stuffed page is still there in the ranking
7789100 jest nadzieja na to e w nied ugiej przysz o ci b dzie lepiej nie chc teraz o tym m wi ale nied ugo przypomnicie sobie moje s owa
7789101 ja jako trener jestem po raz pierwszy w takiej sytuacji e dochodz do zespo u zawodnicy b d cy w r nym okresie przygotowania do sezonu szczeg lnie e s to kluczowi dla zespo u pi karze
7789102 saya memintanya untuk pergi ke sana dan mengumpulkan banyak uang di jerman dan kemudian kembali bergabung bersama kami untuk beberapa musim
7789103 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
7789104 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
7789105 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
7789106 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
7789107 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
7789108 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
7789109 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
7789110 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
7789111 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
7789112 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
7789113 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture
7789114 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7789115 since 1945 the median house price in the united states has risen by an average of 6 23 per year
7789116 im a property owner we own a lot of property but we live in one or two
7789117 weve reached a point in our civilization where counterculture has mutated into a self obsessed aesthetic vacuum so while countercultures its been stripped of its subversion and originality and is leaving a generation pointlessly commodities of style we are a lost generation desperately clinging to anything that feels real but too afraid to become it ourselves we are a defeated generation resigned to the hypocrisy of those before us who once sang songs or rebellion and now sell them back to us we are the last generation a culmination of all previous things destroyed by the vapidity that surrounds us the hipster represents the end of western civilization a culture so detached and disconnected that it has stopped giving birth to anything new
7789118 i kept the television off and didnt discuss war with the kids around if they had questions or worries i reminded them that he was going to be as safe as possible and that it was our job to pray for all the soldiers not just daddy i set up individual e mail accounts for each child as they got older but dad was the only one who e mailed them they loved that they always got to talk to him individually whenever he called and as long as it wasnt a school night id wake them even if he called late it was worth the loss of a few minutes of sleep
7789119 consider having daddy say goodbye to the kids at home and then you and only you go with him to the airport its very tough on kids when they see mommy and daddy crying
7789120 i think its no secret and i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think that settlement activity is helpful
7789121 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7789122 i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together
7789123 saya melihat indonesia akan melaju ke final sejauh ini saya menilai indonesia a adalah tim terbaik dalam turnamen ini makanya saya sangat senang jika bertemu indonesia a di final
7789124 saya akan menginstruksikan pemain untuk tampil fight hanya dengan begitu mereka akan mendapat sesuatu dari turnamen ini saya juga berharap tim senior tampil fight agar pertandingan menarik dan kedua tim sama sama mendapat pengalaman

7789130 untuk itu perlu dicari solusi untuk memenuhi tim direct selling yang masih ada di beberapa kecamatan
7789131 saya puas dengan permainan tim hari ini saya memang inginkan tim saya bermain ofensif sekaligus pressing ketat terhadap lawan bukan soal menang kalah
7789132 namun saya belum puas karena permainan seperti itu cepat hilang saya harus berteriak dulu baru para pemain kembali bermain seperti skema yang saya inginkan
7789133 indonesia bermain sangat baik saya memang sudah tahu sejak awal bahwa pemain pemain indonesia sangat berpengalaman mereka juga unggul dalam kecepatan dan kekuatan fisik
7789134 kami akan tetap bermain normal prinsipnya setiap pertandingan harus dimenangkan jadi melawan tim indonesia b pun harus fight bukan soal menang atau kalah tapi cara bermain yang diutamakan
7789135 bisa jadi motivasi tim indonesia b yang berisi pemain pemain muda berlipat ketika menghadapi senior mereka itu tidak masalah kami harus mengantisipasi hal itu
7789136 itu justru kesempatan bagus tim indonesia u 21 untuk belajar dari senior mereka kalau memang harus menang menanglah kalau memang kalah pengalaman tentu saja kalah

7789147 the bottom line is that this critically endangered species needs our help
7789148 noaas decision on these measures is based on the best data and scientific understanding available
7789149 what we have seen over and over again where economics and partisanship and political interests bump up against the science science loses
7789150 where the science is the weakest and the economic impact is the greatest
7789151 we still have an active fire but we think we have it contained

7789153 i think that it is no secret and ive said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think the settlement activity is helpful to the process
7789154 what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7789155 in the end of the day the role of the leaders is to try to find a way to live in peace in the future and not to let any kind of noises that relate to the situation on the ground these days to enter the negotiation room
7789156 use it as an excuse and i know they are not using it as an excuse but i understand their frustration sometimes

7789166 but put me in a fancy hotel to search for the prime minister i m ok
7789167 he s already got an indoor dog kennel a heated indoor kennel
7789168 what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name and even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
7789169 he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did
7789170 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the centre of my world
7789171 i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes

7789182 they are using flimsy grounds to ensure the meeting is held outside the heart of the city and using arm twisting tactics to demoralise party workers
7789183 initially we had plans to hold the public meeting at p g tandon grounds but the administration denied permission on grounds that since it was a crowded area a public meeting there was not advisable they are using flimsy grounds to create problems
7789184 for rahul venue is not an issue he can attract followers anywhere
7789185 we had to manage with 237 and there was some worry when we used a fifth bowler but yuvraj bowled well
7789186 he turned the ball and that really worked for us the conditions are slow here and your part timers will have an effect but we dont have a virender sehwag or sachin tendulkar who turn the ball consistently we have to see who is bowling well on a particular day and use him hopefully there wont be a day when none of them work out
7789187 it is time we told the president that he must tell the people the truth at all times

7789197 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians
7789198 natos mission is based on a un mandate and carried upon the invitation of the afghan government
7789199 take every precaution to try to avoid innocent civilian casualties
7789200 the government of afghanistan has repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7789201 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids
7789202 there is always fear of something like this but with these raids we know now its real
7789203 these raids have really highlighted the difficulties towns face in this situation
7789204 im not sure all of these towns have an ability to cope and provide the crisis intervention
7789205 its a different community than when i was growing up for sure
7789206 we have zero tolerance for employing people who are not authorized to work in the u s and use all available tools provided by the u s government to verify the documents of the people we hire
7789207 you can see that people are more scared in general
7789208 some of them they dont even tell you directly but people dont go outside like they used to and things like that
7789209 it would be a huge hit to our community culturally economically our businesses our people a huge hit

7789283 esta es una bola de nieve que el movimiento feminista tenemos a nivel internacional porque no vamos a permitir que ortega llegue a cualquier parte del mundo sin escuchar nuestras propuestas
7789284 ortega no fue juzgado porque se protegi con su inmunidad entonces esto es un acto de repudio
7789285 y otras veinte organizaciones que de manera pac fica e indeterminada van a mantener esta lucha hasta que el presidente zelaya rectifique su posici n

7789295 si la ignoran deber an darse a la tarea de leer

7789300 este es un d a hist rico para los pueblos de am rica latina y el caribe que viva el alba la unidad de los pueblos la unidad centroamericana
7789301 ya perdieron la lucha nuestros enemigos porque honduras no pidi permiso a ning n imperialismo para suscribir el acuerdo de alba y el pueblo ha demostrado que es valiente generoso revolucionario y entregado a causas justas y nobles
7789302 el alba no nos obliga a nada nos abre una puerta de esperanzas para resolver los graves problemas generados por el capitalismo universal que nos ha heredado pobreza y miseria y nos ha tenido sometidos y enga ados los pueblos de am rica hemos sufrido por siglos los ataques de los intereses particulares que han oprimido a nuestras naciones y sin alcanzar la independencia econ mica energ tica y alimentaria

7789310 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7789311 when ted kennedy comes here to ask us all to pull together as a party not many people in this hall are not going to take that next step
7789312 it never stopped him he didnt go in a corner and weep he just started something else and now here he is tonight so tenacious
7789313 anyone whos advanced for him knows he likes a stool
7789314 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7789315 i have a headache from the altitude today i cant imagine what its like for someone whos got radiation chemotherapy and has to take a battery of drugs
7789316 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7789317 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7789318 id heard it from a pretty good source last night but everyone was thrilled to hear about it at our breakfast this is the kind of moment that sen kennedy lives for
7789319 id heard something over the weekend but his health is such an issue it wasnt clear if hed be able to come
7789320 im a cancer survivor and i know how draining this kind of thing can be
7789321 it pushes the focus back on the challenge ahead and on obama and the race it gives people something positive to talk about
7789322 this may be ted kennedys final gift to the party
7789323 this says that he feels this is the democrats year and the party is not as unified as hed like it to be his appearance takes the headlines away from the clinton faction
7789324 happens to be somebody who i love to death hes just a good man and obviously hes going through a difficult time but im glad that we can use this convention to remind people of the contributions hes made to this country
7789325 just charges the atmosphere here the emotion is enormous its just what you want to start off the convention
7789326 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
7789327 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
7789328 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
7789329 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
7789330 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
7789331 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
7789332 nice car but itd be really nice with a gm ls7
7789333 the m3 coupe doesnt quite do it for me but the sedan just oozes rightness

7789346 it has been designed for those who want a device that is as appealing as it is powerful and comes with interchangeable covers that have automatically matching screen themes this balance of performance and style means that it is a powerful and defining step forward from the popular and very successful nokia n72 and nokia n73

7789350 pollack seems oddly unaware of historys motivating forces to assert that what triggers revolutions civil wars and other internal unrest is psychological factors particularly feelings of extreme despair is plain silly the boston tea party could not have been prevented by prozac what is troubling about pollacks view which is fairly representative of his fellow liberal interventionists who are likely to be in power soon is its lack of clarity no matter what good will americas policy community proclaims toward the middle east this mix of blinkered indulgence of israel and disdain for the rest of the region as well as a predilection for wilsonian dreams over achievable goals suggests we will remain in the wilderness for some time to come
7789351 by restoring the colonel to what now seems his rightful position as a courageous principled radical who was dickinsons chosen reader admirer and advocate wineapple throws what she describes as a small considered beam upon the work and life of these two seemingly incompatible friends the recluse and the activist that beam when directed by a writer as thorough and intuitive as wineapple brightens not only the pale figures of the poet and the hitherto elusive colonel but the poems for which upon occasion dickinson drew inspiration from higginsons more active life
7789352 certain writers have a style that can be best likened to body odor irresistible to some obnoxious to many and apparently imperceptible to the writer himself therouxs lack of self awareness his failure to observe the basic hygiene of modesty is compelling in its way after reading the auto hagiography of the turkmen leader niyazov theroux summarizes it as pages and pages most of it self reverential he could be writing a press release for his own book

7789355 all fears to the contrary however american wife is no hatchet job no gossipy kitty kelley bio in disguise nor is it hagiography or the sort of seamy political pulp fiction in which denizens of the capitol have been known to dabble rather it is an intelligent well crafted psychologically astute novel that granted will anger the overly literal and the easily outraged but such people are unlikely to be eager readers of contemporary fiction this book is for those of us who are
7789356 murray bail plays a laconic self concealing game cunningly luring the reader in to his interlinked stories the pages is not an easy or open book but it is an oddly compelling one the spell is most powerfully cast in which can make the world come alive on the page after all perhaps it is fiction that does best what this philosopher is trying for to grasp what he saw before him ordinary objects to fit words only to what can be seen

7789367 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
7789368 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
7789369 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
7789370 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
7789371 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
7789372 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
7789373 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
7789374 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
7789375 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
7789376 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
7789377 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that

7789406 just as we are determined to grow the economy to get to a middle income status simultaneously there is the need to grow the manpower base of the economy so as to be able to rise to the challenges of the new ghana that we are all building without a trained disciplined and dedicated workforce ghana cannot move forward
7789407 to achieve a middle income status by 2015 as envisaged we need a dedicated workforce with the spirit of enquiry and challenge to develop innovative products and the spirit of perseverance and good maintenance culture we also need a motivated workforce that celebrates success with teams and does not promote pull him down tendencies in its ranks

7789411 unfortunately however some of the maize about 250 bags were already going mouldy so the authorities at the time decided to put them aside but no disposal instructions were given so the unwholesome maize continued to be there for some time

7789422 no shia vip or layman has been arrested since the launch of the security plan
7789423 we all know that shia militias in baquba are a source of instability
7789424 influential shia members in the provincial office or in the ruling council were behind the bad security situation in this province it cannot be that all of them are innocent

7789441 back then before the internet it meant to manipulate something to do something it wasnt intended for
7789442 you would find solutions to problems with things you had available we used to say we made furniture with an axe and when youd finished you called the end product a good hack
7789443 it was different back then you would contact people like ibm and ask if you could use their computing power or phone lines linking other computers after office hours the community was so small that no one abused it it was self policing and it worked it was a privilege
7789444 first we did a bit of dumpster diving looking in their trash to find out who their computer company was
7789445 then i paid a visit posing as one of their technicians and got access to the companys servers i secretly installed a wireless network behind a desk while i was there which allowed ryan who was in a car outside to begin hacking into their computer system remotely
7789446 the owner was pissed off when he came in the next morning but then he realised that he ought to take better advice over his security
7789447 when i was a kid i used to do some dark stuff mostly trying to get free phone or internet time and i was charged over it twice although i have no record the thing is today a black hat hacker could do so much damage to a company or to an individual if they didnt have their computer security up to date there is so much money to be made out there these days for me i think growing up and having two sons changed me and made me more responsible i still get to face tough hacking challenges but now i do it for good reasons
7789448 then they just said it was a bug then they began to realise just how potentially damaging this could all be after that it was amazing to see how everyone worked together to find a temporary solution to the problem it isnt completely fixed yet but it will be and a year or so down the line the internet will be more secure than it has ever been i feel very proud to have played a part in that
7789449 when defcon started we used to see it as a nuisance sixteen years on our view has changed once a year all the knowledge out there is pooled and it allows us to see where the next threats are coming from these guys have become our eyes and ears

7789462 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7789463 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7789464 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

7789479 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7789480 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7789481 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7789482 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7789483 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7789484 although the cockroaches will always be fine humans may not
7789485 what people are really looking for is hope if people knew what to do they would do it we need the science to tell us what to do
7789486 we need the will and the heart to enable us to do it
7789487 i really havent thought about brad in years i know he used to be a janitor do you think hes gay what are you basing this on
7789488 well i was just talking to his grandmother and she kept going on about brad and his
7789489 brad is a gay man and a little bit fabulous also he asked about you said you were sassy
7789490 he has grown up to be the nicest young man
7789491 especially considering what he grew up with he is thoughtful and polite and im pretty sure hes gay
7789492 but we can confirm that all resident local families with young children are eligible for certain benefits

7789527 everything we are attract and have is a result of what we have thought
7789528 victory amp liberty comes not by chance but by choice
7789529 youve got more of the concerns weve seen about credit and the financials lehmans down because of the speculation that the bid is not happening and theres a negative report on aig
7789530 the credit crisis is more than a year old and still there are lots and lots of issues
7789531 investor psychology is certainly suffering from credit crisis fatigue people are disappointed that the situation is not visibly improving
7789532 clearly there is no light at the end of the housing tunnel yet
7789533 the supply of unsold homes is still very high suggesting theres going to be downward pressure on prices well into 2009
7789534 whose experience in the civil rights movement was a loss of face and the humiliation of being seen as an immoral people and that doesnt go away
7789535 it has been forgotten that the reason why he king is a hero and a great american is because he weathered the status of being the most hated man in america thats not how we choose to remember it
7789536 if someone had told me 45 years ago that this would be happening i would have said are you crazy are you out of your mind for me this is unreal this is unbelievable
7789537 the u s constitution promises life liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all people we have not always been able to attain that but we are on the way
7789538 thats what my brother was all about that we african americans have something to offer
7789539 some may be able to offer longer hours on four days of the week and potentially improve the access to patients
7789540 it wont damage the building or contents but it will make it uncomfortable
7789541 the truth is im just bitter that clinton didnt get the nomination once again the black man has got something before any woman did sexism is alive and well in this country
7789542 im going to change my affiliation from democrat to independent until i decide
7789543 there will be people who leave this convention saying they will vote for mccain and thats what the media is going to focus on
7789544 but the majority is putting aside the personalities of this convention and well focus on winning the election
7789545 to not honor the 18 million people who voted for clinton in the democratic nominating contests would be a disservice
7789546 but then i will work very hard for senator obama and we will elect a democratic president
7789547 there was bound to be some lingering feelings after such a tough primary and news that she was not vetted for the vp position
7789548 i think they will support obama in the end its still early and there is no real consequence to saying they are supporting mccain as the stakes get higher and the election approaches well see more of a switch to obama
7789549 the ball is in her court shes the only one who can convince them
7789550 i know im cutting off my nose to spite my face but i want mccain to win
7789551 that way hillary can have another chance at the presidency in 2012
7789552 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7789553 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7789554 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7789555 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7789556 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7789557 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7789558 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7789559 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7789560 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7789561 police will use all means to restore normalcy as soon as possible
7789562 the military will not allow them to take control of the country however it is not the time yet for military force
7789563 i will not resign i will stay to protect this country
7789564 the government has given them a lot of time and now government restraint is almost over
7789565 i ask all the protesters who have been blockading or occupying government offices that you still have a chance to withdraw and go back to your homes
7789566 certain reproductive factors may have a greater impact on risk of certain molecular subtypes of disease compared to others
7789567 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
7789568 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7789569 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7789570 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7789571 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7789572 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7789573 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7789574 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7789575 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7789576 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7789577 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7789578 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7789579 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7789580 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7789581 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7789582 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7789583 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7789584 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7789585 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7789586 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7789587 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7789588 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7789589 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7789590 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7789591 luckily ive always been a cricket fan but then i think every indian is born loving cricket playing against some of the worlds most famous cricketers was an intimidating experience it helps that they are all going easy on me
7789592 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7789593 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7789594 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7789595 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7789596 its a good decision for cricket and we are pleased it was unanimous we look forward to dealing with our international colleagues over the details of when the tournament will be postponed to
7789597 every team needs to fit the schedule its a great result for all the players to find out whether were going or not going all the guys are happy now
7789598 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7789599 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7789600 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7789601 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7789602 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7789603 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7789604 we are pushing this material to uk media channels eg a bbc radio programme exposing tensions between al qaeda leadership and supporters and a restricted working group will communicate niche messages through media and non media
7789605 they are not heroes and dont have answers and that they harm you your country and your livelihood
7789606 we dont understand the purpose of sleep but it must be important because all animals do it
7789607 the very fact that dolphins have developed the remarkable specialization rather than merely getting rid of sleep altogether should count as evidence that sleep must serve some essential function and cannot be eliminated
7789608 sleep may be the price you pay so your brain can be plastic the next day
7789609 but under the basic law criminal prosecutions are controlled by the department of justice without interference from anyone so in conducting the ordinances review we need to ensure we abide by the basic law
7789610 we are still apart we are enjoying being good friends we have spent two years together you dont lose that
7789611 thats her business now that we are friends it is not something i have to worry about
7789612 for me michael phelps is a huge inspiration and someone i really look up to
7789613 precise weather forecasting is of crucial significance to groups such as farmers fishermen transporters traffic controllers public and emergency service providers indeed to anyone whose profession is dependent on or affected by the weather we see our automatic weather stations as an enabler for india at large
7789614 a massive operation is on to track down the militants as the bsf the army and the police have cordoned off the entire belt and tracker dogs have been pressed into the operation
7789615 wills has been given a complex about his dancing by his brother and his mates so he has just stopped doing it
7789616 kate loves dancing on a night out and keeps trying to drag will up but hes having none of it
7789617 he doesnt mind a slow dance at the end of a night but he reckons kate is too good for him
7789618 hes told kate he will take lessons and he always keeps a promise
7789619 the lessons are bound to help on his wedding day too
7789620 the only prehistoric human settlement found in darestan was telle atashi pre pottery neolithic village near the city of bam in kerman province
7789621 i dont think we need to beg countries to play against especially during ramadan i mean we have international cricket coming up later this year and then there is the series against india early next year
7789622 in any case we would only be preferring player to represent the national team who are fully committed to the teams cause
7789623 there can be no question of simply putting the same proposition to the people once again there is no basis for believing that a second referendum would produce a different outcome to the one we got on june 12
7789624 minister roches comments may simply have the effect of driving even more people into the no camp
7789625 concerns over social and moral issues taxation and representation on the european commission
7789626 rather than threatening to ram another referendum down peoples throats
7789627 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7789628 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7789629 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7789630 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7789631 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7789632 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7789633 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7789634 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7789635 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7789636 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7789637 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7789638 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7789639 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
7789640 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7789641 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7789642 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7789643 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7789644 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7789645 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7789646 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7789647 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7789648 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
7789649 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
7789650 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off
7789651 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7789652 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban

7789688 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual

7789698 the quality of the training shines through in what the children are taught
7789699 a key factor in the education system of the future
7789700 germany has a long way to go when it comes to weighting the different professions and occupations
7789701 we are by no means talking about an education crisis but we have yet to use all our resources we can still draw on reserves
7789702 we need less fragmentation more networking and better transitions from one system to another
7789703 what is still possible at the interfaces between nursery school and primary school
7789704 move on from learning through play to making childs play of learning
7789705 we have the chance to move into good jobs into recognised occupations
7789706 with intensive practical training it is possible to give every child a good start
7789707 hes working on it right now and says it will be done by the end of the day he thinks
7789708 tests for perfect pitch have always demanded that subjects already have some musical training or at least familiarity with a particular piece of music which really limits the pool of candidates you can test

7789710 despite my initial attempt back in 1988 to free the world from the domination and brainwashing by the evil pc empire here we are now in 2007 trying to make you all into apple drones complete with the same bland taste in clothes a tee and a pair of jeans

7789714 so there is a good feeling within the community but we need to front each week to really get buy in from people in palmie

7789716 they are a bloody good bunch to work with they have a great attitude they work hard and they are a pretty tight unit together
7789717 we just need to see that more consistently on the field
7789718 that is three of our first fives out now we are a little bit thin in that area
7789719 we attacked at the breakdown we knew that auckland spread their numbers so we would have opportunities to create turnovers

7789723 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7789724 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7789725 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7789726 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7789727 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7789728 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7789729 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7789730 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7789731 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7789732 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7789733 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7789734 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7789735 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7789736 no one works for someone we all just work together
7789737 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7789738 in government policies and plans rural youth is also being included so that every section of the society can get equal opportunity for higher education
7789739 this early investment in higher education is paying off today as we move higher and higher up the value chain in the global knowledge economy our tasks and challenges are daunting but so are the opportunities
7789740 we are one of youngest nations in the world and according to observers india has the potential to create over 500 million trained people by the year 2020 that would be over a fourth of the global workforce this big and unique opportunity for india will come from an education revolution that we must undertake as our most important national endeavour
7789741 our governments effort has been to create the next big wave of investment in higher education and the 11th five year plan now under implementation is basically a knowledge investment plan we have significantly increased allocations to the education sector with a five fold increase to an unprecedented rs 2 75 000 crore
7789742 we are putting in place an integrated national knowledge network that would have nodes to all major institutions of higher education and learning this network would help our institutions of higher learning to connect with each other and carry on the relevant interdisciplinary dialogue
7789743 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7789744 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7789745 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7789746 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7789747 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7789748 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful

7789750 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers

7789775 we suffer with not one but two blinding diseases river blindness onchocerciasis and trachoma
7789776 in many places such as in west africa river blindness has been completely eradicated
7789777 but the years of war have meant that its not been possible to do that in south sudan
7789778 we just dont have the surgeons or the clinical officers
7789779 the problem in south sudan is not only disease itself its the problem of how to build the capacity of the local people to help them cater for their own people

7789812 daarbij valt op dat de lonen van mannen sneller groeien dan die van vrouwen waardoor de loonkloof weer groeit
7789813 een randvoorwaarde om meer en meer mensen langer te laten werken
7789814 werknemers hebben er behoefte aan en werkgevers en daarmee de nederlandse economie als geheel plukken de vruchten van investeringen op dit terrein in de vorm van een hogere productiviteit
7789815 werkgevers zullen de komende jaren flink hun best moeten doen om werknemers te boeien en te binden en dan bij voorkeur zonder dat daarbij de arbeidskosten uit de hand lopen

7789879 we cant seem to get rid of that question if we do nothing this will get steadily worse
7789880 there is an arms race here between people who trying to ask obscure questions about us and people who are trying to answer obscure questions about us
7789881 if you think about it 10 years ago this didnt seem like horrible idea to ask for someones personal information
7789882 you could say its probably unlikely that someone will know all of this information about me or spent the time necessary to gather it but now its really easy for someone whos never met you to know all this about you
7789883 in some cases its easier for an attacker with good data mining skills than the real person to answer these questions
7789884 its not so easy to match up a pet name from facebook with another database of login names and another database of social security numbers

7789911 we found in data mining sample last fall a trojan dropper that had downloaded seven different binaries among them was storm and srizbi
7789912 what is confusing people is that youre seeing rustock bots sending out emails that essentially infect people with srizbi so they think it must be srizbi thats sending it but its not
7789913 srizbi is not just one big model its rented out to lots of different spammers
7789914 it could be because they want to separate their malware seeding operation from their spamming operation
7789915 maybe their bots are getting blacklisted faster when theyre sending out urls with fake video files because theyre easy to spot so their spam doesnt get through so they send malware from this botnet and spam from this one to keep out of the blacklists longer

7789965 i think weve done more today with one bucket of water for each person than the politicians have done in the last two years to try to save this river and this town
7789966 our governments effort has been to create the next wave of investment in higher education and the 11th five year plan which is now under implementation is basically a knowledge investment plan
7789967 we have significantly increased allocation to the education sector with a five fold increase to an unprecedented rs 275 000 crore
7789968 india has the potential to create over 500 million trained people by the year 2020 that would be over a fourth of the global workforce this big and unique opportunity for india will come from an education revolution that we must undertake as our most important national endeavour
7789969 we need to work in close partnership with the corporate sector non governmental entities and community organisations we need to facilitate creative partnerships between the public and private sectors in the field of education including higher education

7789974 there were a a couple things we couldnt do in transformers 1 due to budget but also because they seemed too
7789975 yes we do get a bit more dough expect an upgrade and we also know better what we can do this time to maximize the mighty buck and we have the secret weapon that is ian bryce
7789976 going by the length of the script can be tricky because the action is longer in reality than on the page were trying to keep it to two hours but i get a feeling itll be about the same as movie 1
7789977 transformers had 3 plot lines a boy and his car soldiers behind enemy lines and defense policy people all reacting to transformers in a somewhat multiple point of view disaster movie paradigm and structure part two will be a different paradigm more like parallel stories
7789978 the story for part 2 is more global for sure
7789979 back to the future jurassic park close encounters and terminator 2
7789980 we were emulating the style of movie from the old amblin days like back to the future and gremlins which if you watch today are still very funny also the cartoon itself was quite funny also comedy makes things more accessible to a larger audience
7789981 we knew the names of most but michael bay was so upset by leak that he put out a bit of disinformation even claiming that we the writers had no idea which characters we were writing which as i hope is painfully obvious is absurd on its face
7789982 the first movie is all about the mystery and reveal of the transformers as a concept and a species which means we had to hide them a lot in the first hour in the second movie now that everyone believes in the universe we can jump right into the world of the transformers
7789983 the hardest aspect is that you lose the element of surprise we got away with a lot in the first movies because for a long time no one thought it would work or that it was just a silly cartoon and simply proving that wrong is all we had to do the first movie was meant to be somewhat of a mystery for the sequel we need an entirely different structure and paradigm for the movie and we cant rely on it being the first
7789984 one of the themes is about the responsibilities you face when being away from home reflected by sam going to college and by the fact that the transformers themselves are of course far from cybertron
7789985 rumors are not exactly true he came he read for a while and he left then days later we had a meeting with him to talk about his concerns all of which were simple to deal with he wanted to make sure it wasnt too close to the characters hed been playing and we told him it would be our pleasure to differentiate him we all left the meeting smiling and laughing and his agents and the studio started negotiating we just couldnt come up with a mutually satisfactory deal sometimes its s scheduling conflict sometimes its that an actor only wants to agree to be in one movie at a time etc so all i can figure is some one who doesnt know much saw him leave the read early and assumed the rest no hard feelings here
7789986 teaser will surely come out before the end of the year
