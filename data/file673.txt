6730006 chinas success in fighting those terrorists at home has made it impossible for them to survive underground and many are now training abroad
6730007 in 2001 it may have been premature to say that the east turkestan islamic movement was part of the global jihad but by now many of its elements have spent so much time in the tribal border areas of pakistan that we cant really say for sure what cause they stand for
6730008 they are trying to show that their actions are aimed at whom they view as their main opponent the chinese government
6730009 wir freuen uns dass unsere technologie am markt so erfolgreich ist

6730018 shes picking up her spoon why is she holding her hand that way ooh she glared at our cameraman what does she have to be angry about do you think delaney mcgowan is losing her mind take our online poll
6730019 aaahhh okay okay okay i dont want to be that kind of famous
6730020 i want to do something famous but nobody knows im the person who did it
6730021 i will sprinkle clean water upon you to cleanse you
6730022 i will open your graves and have you rise from them
6730023 i will put my spirit in you that you may live
6730024 at present both services are provided from different places making it less convenient for service users to take advantage of all the sexual health services we provide
6730025 providing a one stop service will also allow healthcare professionals to work more closely together in line with the scottish governments scottish sexual health strategy
6730026 anything that makes it easier for people to get advice and treatment is welcome in our eyes
6730027 it is hugely important that everyone has good access to high quality sexual health services
6730028 one thing that she did was to make us aware that we couldnt just sit in our comfortable morningside location and assume that in morningside everybodys all right she made us very aware of the people who were not all right people who had problems who had disabilities people who needed help
6730029 she was just amazing its a tremendous loss for the community she was absolutely tireless in fighting for the rights of people who werent very good at fighting for their own rights
6730030 she was constantly available on the phone for other people and i think thats one of the things that people who remember susie remember most her constant availability to let people have their moans and their laughs and cries together
6730031 she would talk to anybody she loved listening to people
6730032 considering her disabilities she was incredible she was a very strong minded person
6730033 i hope to sort it out over the weekend and next week we will be handing the supplies over
6730034 im glad he seems to have found another way of getting the supplies in but it shouldnt have to come to this
6730035 it behooves every man who values liberty of conscience for himself to resist invasions of it in the case of others or their case may by change of circumstances become his own
6730036 the idea was put to me and i liked it discussions then took place with the school and the council and eventually two years later here we are
6730037 i am absolutely delighted to house the station and to be the only school in the uk to have one
6730038 i think there is so much more to come as well particularly when we hit fm i am sure we will gain confidence and people will come forward with ideas for how the station can develop
6730039 being involved has been a great learning experience for me and presenting live on air has boosted my confidence
6730040 i will continue to present and improve my skills and hopefully training will allow me to take broadcasting further in the future
6730041 vehicles had to manoeuvre at right angles across the pavement
6730042 during the day the operative in charge of the roadworks was instructing people to mount the pavement but as night fell and with the failing light there was a number of angry exchanges with pedestrians shouting at motorists following a number of near misses
6730043 theres a railway line nearby and a family of foxes breeding there theres been a lot of food waste from our recent functions spilling out into the road and the foxes are having a rare old time
6730044 this would involve our solicitor going into court to argue that the council is acting illegally by preventing access to the premises this is obviously going to cost a couple of thousand pounds but we will certainly go down that road if we have to
6730045 tie previously gave us assurance that we would be able to gain access to our premises 24 7
6730046 we strive to accommodate the access needs of local residents and businesses wherever possible
6730047 the excavation in question has now been filled and is currently being fully reinstated we are confident that all necessary health and safety measures were taken during this phase of the work
6730048 the latest round of post office closures are another painful cut on services which have a great and detrimental impact on all our communities
6730049 we are making it clear to royal mail that we would like these closures reversed
6730050 local edinburgh mps nigel griffiths and mark lazarowicz all voted for this
6730051 as you know i was very impressed by your plans for the area and the work which has already been undertaken our boat trip provided an excellent vantage point and i look forward to seeing the project completed
6730052 it sounds like the first minister has trumped the planning committee
6730053 as head of the body which is the final arbiter on the application this is an unusual declaration of support for proposals yet to be decided by the planning committee never mind the scottish government
6730054 it is another example of the first minister treading on dangerous waters
6730055 generally speaking it is not prudent for any government minister to comment on planning applications until the process is completed alex salmond might have been better advised to hold his tongue until then
6730056 obviously when a scheme is approved it is appropriate for a first minister to say he is delighted it has got to that point but for him to intervene at this stage is a little bit previous
6730057 restrictions on public comment apply only to the planning minister or ministers engaged in the planning process while the application is before ministers
6730058 this is a very complex situation im of the view that parents with prams should move if a person with a wheelchair gets on board we have to have a public education campaign that makes it clear wheelchair users come first
6730059 a lot of parents would like to go to a meeting we think it would be more effective to speak to them face to face some of the letters lothian buses has sent back have been ridiculous comparing babies to dogs
6730060 any exclusion of prams from lothian buses services is likely to impact worst on poor families with no access to other forms of transport
6730061 i would like to see lothian buses looking at its fleet and seeing if the buses can be adapted to accommodate two spaces one for prams and one for wheelchairs
6730062 i do have sympathy with lothian buses because they are just trying to comply with the legislation but i would like to see the mothers and disability groups join up to fight together for better access for all
6730063 sometimes we see too much of each other and get bored of each other so im glad weve been put in different classes
6730064 instead of spending 100 on you they only spend 50 each on you its shocking also if you want to be alone you cant because its their bedroom as well
6730065 you get a lot of privileges theres always someone to stick up for you at school and youre never lonely
6730066 you always have something to stick up for you when youre triplets im used to them sitting next to me but im looking forward to making new friends
6730067 we dont want them to be seen as the twins and triplets of the school we wanted them to be independent and make new friends
6730068 it will be easier for them to make new friends if theyre in different classes
6730069 in the fourth year thats just left we had three sets of twins so i dont know if theres something in the water round here
6730070 jon was the type of guy who would help anyone in need rab was in so much pain with toothache that he was unable to go out on patrol jon being the great friend and soldier he was said he would take his place
6730071 its incredible to think that a few minutes later he was shot dead it is an absolute tragedy but it shows the courage that jon had
6730072 we have no problem with this and in fact we are very happy with the level of support we get from nhs lothian
6730073 we are actively engaged in working with nhs lothian to develop an improved funding model for services we provide
6730074 when you come back to edinburgh you will see big changes
6730075 but in terms of architecture he says he is a fan of allan murray and allan murray has done a lot of the architecture so i think theres a mixed message
6730076 i remember when the plans were explained to me and my first reaction was to think it wouldnt be possible to get through the planning hurdles however richard invited me down to see the model and it did move my opinion
6730077 theres no question that we need a new filmhouse and the council needs to play a central part in that
6730078 sir sean connery is the most famous scotsman and there should be a permanent marker to him in the city
6730079 this play has been a total challenge for the kids as were used to doing bright happy clappy musical numbers but this year we wanted to explore something more dark
6730080 amateur dramatics is where most of us start out i was about 12 when i did my first amateur shows with the mcmasters stage school and music theatre for youth
6730081 its my first time at the festival and ive seen a whole range of shows but i honestly couldnt tell you which were amateur and which were professional they were all so good
6730082 i am absolutely delighted and surprised in a way because we were doing a play that wasnt an obvious box office draw
6730083 potter is most well known as a tv screenwriter but when i saw the play i always thought that it would be better performed on stage and i think weve just been proved right
6730084 i started in am dram myself we never had any of the encouragement on offer here today which is why awards like this are so important
6730085 ive read toms reviews for many years and i must say its an honour to receive his commendation but my fiercest critic is still my mother so i was even more delighted when she found our play enthralling
6730086 they were absolutely tiny about the size of my hand the box was lined with a towel and theyd been cleaned and fed they were obviously just away from their mother they still had their umbilical cords attached
6730087 we reckon they were a day old they are very fortunate not to have fallen prey to scavengers because they are so small they could have been eaten by seagulls
6730088 we still have to wait and see whether they are all right they were taken from their mother so young they could be vulnerable to infections
6730089 the first milk they get from their mother is crucial as it contains a substance called colostrum which builds their immune systems a critical time for them will be when they are about 14 days old
6730090 this was a very callous act were keen to hear from anyone who knows who owned them were also very concerned about the mother who will be distraught given the puppies were dumped in this way its likely she is not being well cared for
6730091 theyre doing fine at the moment their eyes are still shut they wont open till they are ten or 14 days old
6730092 theyve now got a foster mum in the form of a teddy bear theyre getting bottle fed a special powdered milk for puppies if someone hadnt found them they wouldnt have survived long there will be a very distressed female dog somewhere
6730093 the owners have been extremely irresponsible if they cant cope with puppies they should have approached someone for help
6730094 the effect on grapefruit juice on some medicines is well established and where this applies it is clearly detailed in patient information leaflets
6730095 all quotes attributed to me on imao are made up including this one
6730096 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and he did despair for in his omniscience he did know that his creations had but three fifths of the splendor of that which would be imao
6730097 this wasnt a shooting that was a random act it was an individual directing his aggression toward another individual not the school or the students inside the school
6730098 he got shot and started walking and he was holding his chest there was blood everywhere and then he fell and his arm hit me
6730099 though festival goers may be tightening their belt at the end of the month the edinburgh mela has plenty to offer those on a budget
6730100 extending the mela to a full week and moving to the new leith site has enabled us to showcase many more acts than in previous years
6730101 the british taxpayer will be absolutely outraged if they are made to pick up the bill for compensation to serious criminals
6730102 davids wealth of knowledge of the criminal justice system makes him an ideal choice for the role i am confident that he will work well with the experienced and committed staff in edinburgh
6730103 i am looking forward to leading the strong dedicated teams serving the people of edinburgh and haddington i know my predecessor established excellent relationships across the local criminal justice system and i intend to build on those
6730104 this means we can join the league confident that we can improve our training routines which then allows us to take stronger squads down to these away games recruiting new members will be easier as we will be able to offer better facilities and regimes where maybe we have been unable to provide these in the past
6730105 all we have to do now is to perform to our very best and do everything we can to bring the league title back to scotland
6730106 tough on seagulls and tough on the causes of seagulls
6730107 seagulls are a menace to scottish towns and cities they thrive on litter and their aggressive behaviour towards other birds pets and even people is increasingly problematic
6730108 i even read this week about a young paperboy who has had to abandon his deliveries due to constant attacks from the birds
6730109 it will provide governments industry and other stakeholders in the planned events field with much needed resources for advancing study in this rapidly growing field of professional practice
6730110 this new centre will be led by a world renowned academic researcher and practitioner responsible for producing hundreds of events for luminaries
6730111 dr goldblatt will be supported by an impressive team of academic researchers in the field of tourism hospitality and events
6730112 it will assist the festival and events industry to identify predictable reliable and sustainable funding
6730113 the savings target of 1 5 per cent was applied to all schools in these circumstances it is my view that it would be inappropriate to exclude one individual school from a savings target implemented in every other departmental service
6730114 i cant believe amy winehouse self harms shes so irritating she must be able to find someone to do it for her
6730115 i am absolutely delighted to have won the award i know self harming is not funny but its just a joke so im not going to beat myself up about it
6730116 most of us have a skeleton in the cupboard david beckham takes his out in public
6730117 we are always challenged in the best possible way when staging this important festival for edinburgh and we are particularly pleased this time to have done additional work with the organisers encouraging delegates to extend their stay in scotland
6730118 my company last came to the edinburgh festival in 1992 and it is so rewarding and exciting that after such a long time there is so much interest in our new show dorian gray
6730119 i am delighted that it dorian gray is proving so popular though it doesnt come as a surprise
6730120 he has been thrilling dance fans and bringing new audiences to dance successfully for years now i am very pleased that we are able to present the world premiere of his new work

6730128 the company has been mandated with the responsibility of supplying the african market outside south africa with rand refinery products namely the kruggerrand coins and small ounce bars ingots
6730129 the bullion products that mih has the capacity to transact in are potential economic stabilisers and inflation fighters as they have a strong hedge effect that can substitute other investment vehicles yet at the same time are able to build dynamic financial muscle
6730130 considering the zero effect that bullion is exposed to in such hostile economic climates it is strange to note why there is no movement on the zimbabwean bullion let alone why there is no gold coin or bar on the market it is also strange why zimbabwe is losing this export revenue
6730131 independence of the central bank and the adoption of a credibly fixed exchange rate are crucial for the success of a currency reform
6730132 the success of currency reforms to end great inflations an empirical analysis of 34 high inflations
6730133 it is a lifetime opportunity for a country such as zimbabwe to be a neighbour of the hosting nation
6730134 there is great need to map out effective business strategies in order to take advantage of tourists that will soon start to descend on the african continent
6730135 the duty remains that of the proponent for insurance to answer questions correctly and truthfully and to disclose all material information
6730136 or that a joint supervisor be appointed in consultation with trade unions
6730137 insufficient pre emptive measures being put into place to counter the very real possibility of their so called independence being compromised
6730138 we are working out modalities of screening people that want to get loans to build houses
6730139 the silver lining on this dark cloud is that the current political happenings may well bring in a new and better dispensation where all zimbabweans work together for the good of our nation
6730140 are we psychologically prepared to work in an environment where everything is available and we are spoilt for choice do we need retraining after years of cutting corners and making ends meet to finally practice proper medicine again
6730141 amid all turmoil it is our belief as zimbabweans that we have the capacity and the stamina to ensure that our healthcare delivery system is second to none once more if we remain united for this purpose
6730142 if one is found charging in foreign currency law enforcement agents can take over as zima we charge in local currency
6730143 a maior festa ol mpica amigos a maior festa ol mpica da hist ria
6730144 a computer memory stick containing the personal information of tens of thousands of criminals has been lost who should be responsible for keeping our personal information secure
6730145 i am pleased to report another quarter during which we have grown revenues improved margins and strengthened our balance sheet the important steps we have taken over the past year to improve operational efficiency and develop market leading products are beginning to show genuine improvements to our bottom line and this gives me confidence that we are better positioned than ever for future growth
6730146 although we managed to improve margins during the first half of the year we still face a number of potential challenges in the second half in particular wafer costs and wafer quality
6730147 despite these challenges i am confident that our improving supply pipeline declining wafer costs and higher conversion efficiencies will strengthen our gross margin from the end of this year and into 2009
6730148 we are now in a far more stable financial position and are better placed to secure long term supply agreements to expand production and to fund r amp d enhancement in a cost effective manner our contract with rec will help us to reduce overall wafer costs from 2009 we remain cautious about the overall market outlook for wafer prices in the second half of this year however the expected increase in high efficiency cell production will enable us to at least partially offset any increase in wafer cost
6730149 severstal resources believes that the high demand for primary raw materials for steel production including coking coal and iron ore will continue due to the strong industrial fundamentals in global metals and mining
6730150 gregory mason ceo of severstal international and coo of oao severstal added
6730151 always when championship teams come into the premier league they fight for everything
6730152 we have to be prepared they have already lost one game and so have we we have to get the three points
6730153 it isnt easy to beat any team in the premier league
6730154 the entire community of beechtree is designed to look and feel like a prestigious lakefront resort
6730155 early on we committed to developing over 30 million worth of amenities at beechtree including a pga quality championship golf course and a 30 acre lake additionally it was important to ryko development to choose prince georges countys premier homebuilders capable of building the finest new homes in upper marlboro
6730156 was to set a higher standard for luxury communities in prince georges county so great care and consideration was given to ensuring our new homes and amenities complement one another to create an atmosphere of luxury and prestige throughout beechtree
6730157 smooth jazz 105 9 has definitely been a friend to the community
6730158 in addition to co hosting beechtree live in our models theyre continuing to help us tell the beechtree story through a special radio campaign heard exclusively on their station

6730161 the erongo region of namibia is renowned for its richness in fisheries and agricultural products among others these remain some of the potential areas of collaboration with our province
6730162 south africa and namibia share a special historical bond which dates back many decades when both of us were involved in the protracted struggle against apartheid and colonialism
6730163 undertake comprehensive analysis of the transitioning to a 4 day work week for all possible federal employees and inform me by august 31 of any additional actions congress would need to take to implement such a policy by the end of fiscal year 2008
6730164 federal employers will have to offer employees more flexibility in their work lives if they are to successfully recruit and retain qualified workers
6730165 use of flexible and compressed work schedules helped agencies recruit for some hard to fill jobs and helped agencies retain employees who otherwise would have resigned or been terminated
6730166 the centre will primarily serve the informal trading sector and the taxi drivers at the mall
6730167 it will serve as a platform from which the informal sector will improve their businesses and also provide hiv aids advisory services to both informal traders and the taxi industry
6730168 the mtc was established in 1999 to basically run trader markets and public transport facilities
6730169 but this mandate has grown and become wider and wider as we came to understand our customers better and better
6730170 it represents a new exciting and far reaching concept our vision is to see the centre providing health services to more than 500 000 people yearly

6730184 everything we are attract and have is a result of what we have thought
6730185 victory amp liberty comes not by chance but by choice
6730186 limiting the charges paid to the national grid by renewables generators on the scottish islands is vital if their vast potential is to be realised
6730187 the government continues to believe that cost reflective transmission charging is a sensible basis for charging
6730188 cost reflective transmission charging is where the users of the transmission system pay according to the cost of transmitting the electricity
6730189 in this way the operators take account of the true cost of transmitting electricity
6730190 we need a level playing field and this is utterly the wrong signal
6730191 its the wrong signal from a climate change standpoint from creating further downward pressure on energy prices and for economic recovery in scotland
6730192 we know that developers of wind farms in scotland dont even take projects beyond the drawing board because they know the transmission charges in the north of scotland and the islands are so severe
6730193 so its undermining investment in renewables in scotland i think particularly worrying is that fledgling technologies like wave and tidal will have to also pay these types of charges
6730194 i am today able to announce that a 5 000 reward is being offered for information which leads to the arrest and conviction of those responsible
6730195 it is important to the investigation to understand who is involved in this process and how it operates
6730196 i understand people may be concerned that the police will look to prosecute those involved my only objective is to solve this murder inquiry and information can be passed anonymously to assist in this process
6730197 myself and colleagues are doing all we can to bring those responsible for this brutal murder to justice and we want to work with the chinese community in the uk
6730198 we are currently going through the bank accounts and financial state of things we dont think these people were making a huge amount of money out of whatever has been taking place
6730199 whether thats the sole motive of this attack we dont know at this stage we want to find out whether the two victims figured in the chain of command
6730200 it makes him a person who is very important that we need to speak to whether hes a prime suspect or not im not really sure at this stage
6730201 there may well be a perfectly innocent explanation for the lodger disappearing but what we want to do is speak to this individual because he may be able to tell us about the last movements of the victims
6730202 the closure of the 53 branches will generate cost savings for the business so too will reductions in central support for the branches that are closing
6730203 the changes reflect a significant decline in the level of housing transactions in the last 12 months
6730204 they didnt do one of the most absolute minimum things to do implement password protection
6730205 if theyd been thinking of this information as an asset and were considering the risks around it they wouldve applied that minimum level of protection and probably quite a bit more
6730206 we devote a lot of attention to the security of our data and have extensive procedures in place to manage this process on monday we were advised that some information which had been kept safe and secure may have inadvertently been accessible to highly sophisticated computer users
6730207 a preliminary investigation launched as soon as we were made aware of this problem suggests that this occurred due to a breakdown in our normal data security protocols when web hosting was recently migrated to a new provider
6730208 at this point it does not appear the data was ever widely available nonetheless we have apologized to our customers for this situation and assured them that access to the information has been closed and that we are working diligently to put in place any needed remedies to make certain this problem does not recur
6730209 we see this time and time again in universities colleges and corporations
6730210 if you have data in a regular file and its not encrypted which protects you against this type of errors its just a matter of time before you get an error like this where large amounts of data are exposed to people who are not supposed to have access to it
6730211 they should have monitored their network and their access logs
6730212 if they had this problem would have been caught after one or two days it certainly shouldnt have gone on for seven weeks
6730213 data is as critical to business as water is to humans
6730214 most organizations dont know what data they can and cannot expose and to whom
6730215 so asking it to protect that is like asking a security guard to look out for somebody without specifying who
6730216 an unknown and unauthorized third party between november 2007 and february 2008
6730217 secured all our systems implemented enhanced website and database security measures contacted law enforcement and notified all the individuals who may have been affected
6730218 must think strategically about security and how it is critical to their business and how it relates to their core business functions
6730219 the princeton review were probably following conventional wisdom around security and werent focused on this information or aware of the acute risks they faced if it was exposed

6730255 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6730256 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6730257 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
6730258 the us has gone very far in this agreement it is a very advanced agreement
6730259 its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification or anything like that
6730260 all the evidence is that the economy is still slowing dragged down by the falling housing market and sky high food and fuel prices this high inflation will make it very difficult for the bank of england to cut rates in the near future

6730330 how did gabbert handle the promotion about what youd expect from a true freshman quarterback some good some shaky but he put together a few methodical series including the lone touchdown drive of the day he connected with gahn mcgaffie on a 40 yard rope that the freshman receiver took down to the 1 yard line it was either a brilliant adjustment on mcgaffies part or uncanny timing between the two because when the ball left his hand it had interception written all over it gabbert also threw an interception to trey hobson that might have been returned for a touchdown in a live game
6730331 one question that lingers from the two a day period of practice concerns which unit of this team is ahead of the other

6730337 the large sized lcd panel market has been mired in a state of severe oversupply since the start of june because of the lower than expected panel demand and high inventory levels throughout the supply chain
6730338 conditions have worsened in august with poor economic circumstances causing prices to decline at an even faster pace than before however panel production cuts combined with the clearance of inventory and a recovery in demand from tvs desktop pc monitors and notebook pcs are expected to shift the supply and demand equation back to balance in september
6730339 reacting to weak sales and declining profitability panel suppliers began to slash their utilization rates starting in july
6730340 lcd tv and desktop pc monitor manufacturers also are starting to cut their prices to reduce inventories and boost end user demand these developments along with recovering demand from the notebook segment will bring stabilization to large sized lcd panel pricing in september some panel prices may even increase by 1 to 3 percent especially those that reach at par or below the cost levels

6730351 i grew up catholic and heard about these kinds of things happening faces appearing on objects and how they affected people in certain communities i started to think about what kind of person who would be the worst person for something like this to happen to and that was the starting point

6730368 i have always found that the greatest gift in life is to help others pulling a plane along a runway with my team members is going to be a challenge but nowhere near as difficult as the challenges that some people face every day living with a disability
6730369 i feel events such as these are important to raise awareness and change perceptions and attitudes towards people in our communities who have disabilities i think that it is particularly important that children see that having a disability does not have to hold them back from living a full and exciting life
6730370 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6730371 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6730372 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this

6730393 the government will no doubt seek to blame private contractors but the rash of data losses over the last two years confirm that there is something much more worrying at stake this government cannot keep any information safe
6730394 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
6730395 if you hand out memory sticks almost like confetti to companies and ask them to do research for you then you have to be absolutely certain that the company concerned has put in practice procedures which will be just as robust as the procedures that i hope the government has followed
6730396 a full investigation is being conducted police and the information commissioner have been informed
6730397 what has concerned us is the violence the disruptions that has led us to be concerned about the safety of our employees our equipment and investment and of the viability of the process

6730426 tutti ci dicevano giusto esserci ora penso di aver partecipato a un teatrino
6730427 invito gli atleti che sono ancora a pechino a fare la loro gara e dopo soltanto dopo manifestare a favore del popolo tibetano
6730428 c stato un tam tam incredibile prima dei giochi ma appena arrivati sembrava messo tutto sotto silenzio nessuno ci faceva pi domande abbiamo fatto bene a venire mi dicevo mi sentivo tranquilla finalmente
6730429 mi sono ricordata del dramma del popolo tibetano mi sono sentita quasi in colpa per aver gioito per le mie due medaglie mentre nello stesso paese si reprimono le manifestazioni di gente innocente
6730430 ma io mi fido delle parole che vengono dal dalai lama indipendentemente dallattendibilit di quest ultima notizia sui morti nellest del tibet anche se non fosse vera da quanti anni lui denuncia la repressione vogliamo dubitare della sua sincerit
6730431 la colpa di tutti quelli che dimenticano anche se in cina sembrava tutto migliorato ma quanto migliorato vogliamo parlare dellepisodio demenziale che ha visto protagoniste noi fiorettiste durante la cerimonia inaugurale
6730432 da jesi a frascati a trieste vi conciamo per le feste
6730433 la tv cinese ci ha censurate se applicano queste misure per una sciocchezza cosa potranno fare per altri tipi di manifestazioni siamo stati protagonisti di un simpatico teatrino
6730434 a questo punto credo che le olimpiadi siano state inutili lorganizzazione impeccabile lo splendore esibito in questi giorni nasconde altre verit come le medaglie coniate per questa edizione davanti loro largento il bronzo dietro la giada che mi risulta provenire dallo sfruttamento di molti lavoratori
6730435 ripeto il boicottaggio cambia poco la storia lo dimostra il problema a monte risale al momento in cui stata scelta pechino come sede olimpica in questo scenario cinese anche il cio si sta dimostrando troppo severo come dimostra lepisodio del divieto di esporre la bandiera spagnola a mezz asta o di indossare un braccialetto nero per la tragedia di madrid

6730443 theres a huge boom in alternative therapies but the evidence is not there and the public dont realise about the lack of evidence but you have lots of websites and newspaper articles lifestyle magazines and clever marketing and if people knew the truth then there wouldnt be such a boom in these therapies
6730444 my wife got sick in 2007 for 9 months went to colombo and spent more than 300 000 rupees one doctor said we cant do anything because the brain has problems and you must pray i couldnt believe it and came to an ayurvedic clinic and the doctor there said it was not a big problem the treatment was very hard every morning and afternoon you have a massage the medicine is cheap and fortunately my wife is now 90 percent fit and she can walk and go to the market and go to school with my son and she seems very well
6730445 my attitude would be that the sri lankan government should really examine it properly and thoroughly because if elements of it do work then its great we should embrace them and exploit them further but if other bits are hazardous or of no impact whatsoever then they should be put to one side regardless of how natural they feel or regardless of how many thousands of years theyve been used

6730491 i am a doctor but not a good typist and i have found that dragon naturallyspeaking dns is indispensable in making entries into my electronic medical record emr program dns has saved me literally thousands of hours in the last few years in updating my patients records but i purchased a copy of dns version 10 as soon as it was available and tried to begin dictating into my emr dns stopped dead a dialog box appeared stating that the only version of naturally speaking 10 that would dictate into an emr was the medical version of dragon which costs 10 times the price very sad that nuance has chosen to take the low road in dealing with its new and established customers
6730492 you are correct that we decided to remove emr support from the non medical versions of dragon
6730493 having said that please note that along with the launch of dragon medical 10 in september we will announce attractive upgrade offers for customers who have been using non medical dragon versions in medical settings

6730531 although yeast can derive energy from a lot of different carbon sources such as fatty acids and different kinds of sugars yeast really really like glucose the sugar found in honey
6730532 thats what they will use if its there even if its there only in trace amounts
6730533 how do you get yeast to give up their habit of using only glucose no matter what else is around
6730534 yeast essentially care about glucose because they are genetically programmed that way not because there is any physiological reason they have to care about glucose
6730535 we can genetically change that program we are using genetics to modify yeast strains so that they will use other sugars just as well as glucose

6730539 thirty seven percent of the colleges fleet runs on some form of renewable energy including biodiesel
6730540 using the butter sculpture is a unique way to fuel the esf fleet
6730541 this separates out the triglycerides which will be split in our reactor at esf a process known as transesterification that creates the biodiesel
6730542 dairy farmers are the original environmentalists recycling nutrients and water on their land so it makes sense that this annual tribute to them is itself finding new life in fuel rather than being discarded
6730543 this is a fitting way to mark the sculptures 40th anniversary
6730544 as onondaga countys local recycling agency ocrra is thrilled with this innovative project
6730545 turning butter art into fuel for their vehicles is a great demonstration of esf turning knowledge into practice what a terrific way to reuse what was a waste in the past

6730551 right now the challenge for photovoltaics is to make the technology less expensive
6730552 therefore the objective is find new materials and novel device structures for cost effective photovoltaic devices
6730553 the beauty of organic photovoltaics and organic leds is low cost and flexibility
6730554 these devices can be fabricated by inexpensive solution based processing techniques similar to painting or printing
6730555 the ease of production brings costs down while the mechanical flexibility of the materials opens up a wide range of applications
6730556 the research at sdsu is focused on new materials with variable band gaps
6730557 the band gap determines how much solar energy the photovoltaic device can absorb and convert into electricity
6730558 were working on synthesizing novel polymers with variable band gaps including high medium and low band gap varieties to absorb the full spectrum of sunlight by this we can double the light harvesting or absorption
6730559 we are working to develop these new light emitting and efficient charge transporting materials to improve the light emitting efficiency of full color displays

6730623 we asinganians appreciate the gilas initiative through the ayala foundation to provide computers and internet service to the toboy high school such a magnanimous act is a rarity that when the idea was brought to me it struck a nerve of the ny nj pa friends of asingan inc s mission the desire to improve the quality of life of needy asinganians there was no hesitation from the officers and members when presented to them to embrace the project it got jumpstarted with the 1 000 donation of our vice president dr bernard cruz and his wife nita in late december
6730624 it is our belief that these young students should not be deprived of this once in a lifetime opportunity to enhance their hands on knowledge of the latest information technology which will enable them to be creative and be competitive in the 21
6730625 the speakers were prepared with their topics anthony introduced a new concept of donation which i believe if explained to prospective donors can generate more donations to gilas vicky as usual is eloquent with the topic speaking from her heart i am thinking of some fil am organizations gatherings where gilas representatives can possibly present short talk like the one we had in the philippine center

6730628 we have had to alternate our work force in order to cut down on our costs its a national problem and we are not spared
6730629 i believe in the gilas project and i felt that the projects goals were consistent with the type of projects that lehman supported
6730630 corporations have an inordinate amount of funds that they can give back to the global community gilas is a project that is focused on helping the youth the consumers and producers of the future it is their best interest to support projects that will directly or indirectly increase the size of their market and assist their future human resources
6730631 i am very interested in what the foundation is doing in bringing computers to the schools
6730632 i wanted to give back to the philippines especially in education

6730642 the main reason we were in dc was mainly to announce the official launch of our youtube competition for gilas it was find weekend at the at college park
6730643 in our experience its always been a great event where we are able to meet countless people who continue to inspire us to this day and because it is the biggest gathering of filipino college kids across the east coast its also a great time to party and represent for your school and organization
6730644 after years of attending as delegates we are now on the other side of the spectrum attending as vendors running the gilas information table at the event we were able to discuss many points of the gilas project and were able to build upon our growing volunteer base
6730645 the workshop given by benjamin de la pena of the gilas group in dc inspired several students and their respective schools to pledge some funds and volunteer time to gilas
6730646 the gilas volunteers did such a great job at the table they were the most enthusiastic representatives at the event and are the most memorable they were definitely faces not to be forgotten as their presence was made known gilas was well exposed to our target segment many people collected information and there were even some potential donations already we will be following up in the weeks to come
6730647 im very enthusiastic about the relationship that find inc and gilas have started i think its a great beginning that will hopefully eventually bridge the students here in the and help to solve the problems of education i certainly look forward to seeing this partnership flourish in the days months and years to come
6730648 the principal and teacher were both very thankful to gilas for the computers because it has vastly improved the quality of the students research
6730649 it has benefited the more underprivileged students since they wont have to pay to use a computer at an internet cafe it has also increased internet usage among the students schedules are posted online and homeworks are also submitted online mr suguilon also showed us one email from a relatively underprivileged student wherein the student confided to him her problems via email

6730689 quedarme en el real madrid no es mi objetivo para la pr xima temporada respeto mucho al club a los jugadores y principalmente a la afici n que siempre me ha tratado bien pero no es mi objetivo tengo una propuesta buena para mi y para el club tambi n y mi objetivo la pr xima temporada no es seguir en el real madrid
6730690 el principal motivo es que tengo la ilusi n de jugar la liga inglesa el chelsea tiene una gran plantilla un gran equipo tengo el objetivo de jugar all no tengo nada en contra del real madrid estoy muy agradecido porque me ha dado muchas cosas me ha dado una proyecci n muy grande pero en este momento mi objetivo es salir del real madrid espero que se pueda resolver lo m s r pido posible
6730691 no es por dinero simplemente porque tengo el objetivo de salir mi objetivo personal es ser el mejor jugador del mundo y en el real madrid eso no va a ser posible entonces tengo el objetivo de jugar la pr xima temporada en la liga inglesa
6730692 he cumplido un ciclo he jugado tres temporadas en el real madrid he dado el m ximo de m he hecho goles he ganado dos ligas que no es f cil creo que mi etapa en el real madrid ha llegado al final espero que los directivos lleguen a un acuerdo con el chelsea para solventar mi situaci n lo m s r pido posible
6730693 ha habido muchos casos similares a la inversa con el real madrid de protagonista sin ir m s lejos su salida del santos o recientemente el caso de cristiano ronaldo
6730694 ya le dije eso al presidente a los directivos y al entrenador tambi n que no es mi objetivo seguir en el real madrid cada jugador tiene una personalidad yo tengo la m a y no lo hab a hablado con la prensa para evitar pol micas
6730695 ahora estoy diciendo la verdad quiero salir y tengo la personalidad de decir por la prensa que no tengo el objetivo de quedarme en el real madrid agradezco a la afici n su cari o a los jugadores con los que tengo una amistad para toda la vida pero mi objetivo la pr xima temporada es jugar la premier league
6730696 mi relaci n con el entrenador y los jugadores es la mejor posible tuve la suerte de tener unos compa eros buenos que siempre me han tratado bien tengo un cari o enorme por todos los jugadores sin excepci n ninguna extranjeros y espa oles por schuster tambi n me parece un entrenador excelente con quien nunca tuve un problema no tengo nada malo que hablar de los jugadores ni del entrenador
6730697 sino que quiero resolver mi situaci n lo m s r pido posible
6730698 a partir del momento que el entrenador me pone a jugar lo hago al cien por cien primero porque llevo una camiseta por detr s una afici n que exige mucho segundo porque en el campo es mi imagen que transmito a los dem s y tercero por toda la plantilla porque si voy flojo a un bal n est perjudicando a toda la plantilla y eso no me gusta cuando entro para jugar lo hago a tope unas veces me sale y otras no pero juego a tope siempre
6730699 es que los directivos entiendan mi situaci n resolverla lo m s r pido posible pero yo voy a seguir como profesional que soy nunca he faltado a ning n entrenamiento del real madrid he entrenado todos los d as y voy a seguir haci ndolo sobre jugar no s si voy a jugar o no principalmente porque si las cosas no me salen bien la gente puede decir que no me salen porque estoy con la cabeza all para evitar ese tipo de comentario es mejor que schuster ponga a otros jugadores
6730700 intent dar el m ximo de m claro que estoy pensativo y quiero que se resuelva todo lo m s r pido posible pero cuando entro al campo me intento olvidar de todo lo que pasa fuera e intento dar el m ximo
6730701 por la calle caminando tambi n me puedo doblar el tobillo y lesionarme lo que me preocupa es el pensamiento de la afici n que piensen que no juego bien porque tengo la cabeza en el chelsea en este momento es mejor que no juegue y que resuelvan mi situaci n lo m s r pido posible

6730751 it is unacceptable that black students should have to put up with blatant racist stereotypes at nus events it is unacceptable that slavery can be treated as a joke
6730752 it is unacceptable that nothing was done about this by the senior nus nec members present and it was only when i was involved that action was taken this only happened because a distressed black student who felt it hadnt been dealt with immediately contacted me
6730753 this whole process took nearly three hours and included me having to contact the nus president incidents of racism should be dealt with immediately
6730754 it goes without saying that nus takes the issues of equal opportunities and safe space very seriously and i am thus determined that the allegations are handled properly
6730755 it is important in both instances that we do not tolerate racism or a failure to deal with it it is however also important that we do not pre judge the outcome of any investigation

6730762 seit mitte der 70er jahre haben zweitakt motoren die 500er klasse dominiert bevor die viertakt maschinen ende 2001 einzug gehalten haben was sind die charakteristiken und unterschiede dieser zwei technologien
6730763 die unterschiede zwischen diesen beiden motortypen liegen im konstruktiven und mechanischen bereich aber auch in der fahrbarkeit und der kostenfaktor spielt eine rolle
6730764 der viertakter komplexer und schwerer als sein zweitakt gegenst ck
6730765 im vergleich dazu ist der viertakter komplexer und schwerer als sein zweitakt gegenst ck der obere teil des aggregats ist der kopf der die ventile durch nockenwellen steuert der motor bekommt durch die einspritzung des treibstoffes zus tzliche kraft die schmierung der zweitakt maschine der kurbelwellen und der verbindungsteile wird durch den treibstoff besorgt
6730766 die leistung wird durch den vergaser gesteuert der seinerseits durch druck der kolbenbewegung gesteuert wird die schmierung der verschiedenen mechanismen bei einem viertakt motor basiert auf l welches in einem ganz unten am motor befestigten beh lter der sogenannten lwanne aufbewahrt wird diese kann entweder trocken oder nass sein je nach dem ob l in einem zus tzlichem tank mitgef hrt wird oder nicht
6730767 wie haben diese ver nderungen ihre arbeitsweise in der box ver ndert
6730768 die instandhaltung und einstellung einer zweitakt maschine unterscheidet sich sehr von einem viertakter und erfordert keine allzu gro en bedingungen dies ist bedingt durch die einfache konstruktion des motors in der vergangenheit konnten mechaniker eines teams selbst am motor arbeiten auch bei kunden teams der umgang mit einer viertakt maschine ist sehr kompliziert und nur noch werkstechniker d rfen an den antriebseinheiten arbeiten w hrend die mechaniker der kunden teams nur soweit an den motoren t fteln d rfen sofern es die ffnung des aggregats nicht erfordert
6730769 in der modernen motogp ist die entfaltung von drehmoment und leistung wesentlich linearer und progressiver
6730770 nachdem die motoren so unterschiedlich sind inwiefern unterscheiden sich die eindr cke der fahrer wenn sie die motoren fahren
6730771 die besonderheit bei den zweitaktern ist im prinzip dass sie in niedrigen drehzahlen ein sehr niedriges drehmoment produzieren aber in hohen drehzahlen ein entsprechend hohes drehmoment in der 500er klasse war das maximale drehmoment sehr nahe der maximalen drehzahl aber in der modernen motogp ist die entfaltung von drehmoment und leistung wesentlich linearer und progressiver er kann also besser genutzt werden und hat ein breiteres leistungsfenster als ein zweitaktmotor
6730772 um den zweitaktern eine h here flexibilit t zu verpassen wurden die auspuffventile verbreitert der unterschied auf der strecke bestand darin dass sie zweitakter auf dem gas absolut unsensibel waren die bikes hatten nahezu keine motorbremse und leichter waren sie auch in der motogp macht es nicht so viel aus wenn man die ideallinie verl sst weil man wesentlich mehr drehmoment und leistung zur verf gung hat man kann von berall gut heraus beschleunigen
6730773 mit einer 500er maschnie war die beschleunigungsphase der komplizierteste abschnitt weil die kraft sich so leistung sich so brutal entfaltete das bedeutete dass ein fahrfehler sofort in einen pl tzlichen verlust der hinterradtraktion und in einem klassischen highsider f hrte die zweitaktmaschinen erforderten vom fahrer sehr viel feingef hl besonders auf dem gas
6730774 bei den viertaktern wird die recht hohe leistung vom elektronischen motormanagement und die traktionskontrolle gedrosselt dieses jahr zum beispiel hatten die anf nger die frisch von der 250er zweitakt weltmeisterschaft kamen es leicht recht schnell gute ergebnisse in den rennen einzufahren weil sie schon in der kategorie die sie gerade verlassen haben die besten waren
6730775 bei viertaktern macht man sachen oder arbeitet man an parametern die bei den zweitaktern weniger wichtig waren
6730776 2002 feierten die viertakter in der motogp ihr deb t die zweifel an dieser technologie sind nun weggewischt aber was sind die genauen unterschiede wenn man in der boxen garage mit diesen motoren arbeitet
6730777 es war ein unbekanntes abenteuer nicht nur die entwicklung des motorrads als auch seine neue technologie erforderten eine andere arbeitsweise vom team vom operativen standpunkt aus haben sich die dinge in der garage sehr ver ndert bei viertaktern macht man sachen oder arbeitet man an parametern die bei den zweitaktern weniger wichtig waren
6730778 das typische beispiel daf r ist das elektronische motormanagement welches bei den viertaktern ein sehr wichtiger punkt ist bei den zweitaktern hat man die zeit damit verbracht die maschinen zu ffnen und zylinder und kolben zu tauschen heutzutage konzentrieren sich die techniker und mechaniker eher darauf das setup und die reifen eines bikes zu entwickeln
6730779 es scheint als h tte die arbeit in den boxen abgenommen und nun alles zu elektronik spezialisten deligiert worden ist stimmt das
6730780 wir arbeiten nicht weniger als vorher seit wir mit dem neuen motor zu tun haben vielmehr haben sich die aufgabengebiete ge ndert wir arbeiten hart und die f higkeiten der mechaniker und die wettbewerbsnatur unserer aufgabe bedeutet dass die nur kleinste bruchteile einer sekunde auseinander liegen und wir uns die kleinsten details ansehen m ssen es ist selbst wichtig auch nur ein zehntel herauszukitzeln das ist ein gro er wettbewerb und der findet auch in den garagen statt
6730781 lo considero un fatto del tutto nuovo da valutare positivamente perch credo non si possa auspicare un clima di conflitto sui temi istituzionali il paese non pu permetterselo in una democrazia matura non si confondono i ruoli normale che ci sia convergenza sulle regole del gioco ma nessuna melassa sul piano programmatico
6730782 ho visto pubblicare sui giornali con una sorpresa la foto di una stretta di mano tra il presidente del consiglio e il leader dellopposizione dovrebbe essere normale
6730783 differenza su temi e ricette e il via libera del pd condizionato allesame dei testi
6730784 no a riforme costituzionali a maggioranza conflitti permanenti non riconoscendo la legittimazione dellavversario e avere magari sul piano programmatico confini imperscrutabili
6730785 sono urgenti e vanno fatte insieme lo avrei fatto se fossi stato capo del governo lo faccio leader dellopposizione ho detto a berlusconi che si deve ricominciare da subito perch litalia ha bisogno di andare pi veloce
6730786 altrimenti il paese va a gambe allaria per questo si devono cercare convergenze
6730787 i grandi temi di politica estera sono uno di quei terreni sui quali il paese pi unito e pi forte un tema che non deve far parte del confronto con il capo del governo ma la cui sede sono le aule parlamentari un tema sul quale bisogna cercare convergenze al netto delle diversit
6730788 sarebbe necessario fare una nuova normativa questa una di quelle materie su cui ci sono stati grandissimi problemi serve una nuova norma che vada nella direzione di una fuoriuscita dei partiti il cda della rai deve essere eletto sulla base di nuove norme
6730789 la legge elettorale per le europee va cambiata alzando la soglia di sbarramento ma non va impedito a quelle forze politiche che non sono rappresentate nel parlamento italiano di essere presenti a strasburgo
6730790 mi aspetto che il governo presenti delle proposte per far fronte alla vera emergenza la condizione sociale ed economica delle famiglie italiane labolizione dellici sar valutata quando verr varata e soprattutto se ne valuter la copertura economica
6730791 se ci sono risorse vanno destinate ad aumentare salari stipendi pensioni e a far usicre tanti giovani dal precariato
6730792 anche un conflitto tutto nellottica di aiutare lavoratori e azienda mi auguro di comune intento resto dellidea che aver fatto andar via air france e aver annunciato una cordata che al momento ancora non esiste stato un grave errore e normale ha detto alla fine che si cerchi la convergenza sulle regole del gioco e al tempo stesso ci sia il confronto pi aspro e serrato necessario sui programmi
6730793 veltroni nel pomeriggio ha telefonato a pierferdinando casini leader delludc e al capogruppo dellitalia dei valori massimo donadi
6730794 o il governo cambia o non ci sar pi il dialogo il governo nato da un mese e la sequenza di strappi ripetuti inaccettabile
6730795 prima la norma salva rete 4 stoppata in parlamento poi lintroduzione del reato dimmigrazione clandestina lassenza di proposte su alitalia il disegno di legge sulle intercettazioni presentato senza discutere n con le opposizioni n con i magistrati poi la proposta di inviare 2 500 militari nelle strade e infine linserimento del lodo schifani nel decreto sicurezza e ancora pi grave gli atteggiamenti di un ministro contro leuropa il riferimento a calderoli ndr che definisce il trattato di lisbona un documento da pompe funebri noi siamo di fronte ad una sequenza di fatti che finisce per conformarsi come una linea politica da parte del governo
6730796 non si pu attribuire alla responsabilit dellopposizione questa serie di misure che rischiano di pregiudicare il dialogo si deve decidere che clima avere gli stappi strappano anche il dialogo non una zona dove trovare riparo dalle tensioni questa sar una settimana decisiva e decider quale sar il segno di questa legislatura se sar improntata al dialogo oppure no venerd allassemblea del pd tireremo le conclusioni ha spiegato veltroni ma il dialogo per farlo bisogna essere in due e se si confermer questo atteggiamento da parte del governo venerd tireremo le fila di questo e non si potr dire che sar stata lopposizione a impedire il dialogo si pu benissimo fare opposizione anche in assenza di dialogo senza comunque arrivare alla demonizzazione dellavversario
6730797 deve diventare istituzionale il clima civile nei rapporti tra maggioranza e opposizione che stiamo provando a instaurare in italia si passa dalla demonizzazione allinciucio ma di questo spirito sono eticamente convinto le regole vanno scritte insieme non pu esserci un atteggiamento unidirezionale la cosa peggiore per chi vince le elezioni pensare di avere in mano il paese ma le lune di miele in politica si interrompono bruscamente
6730798 un anno fa sembrava invincibile poi le amministrative lo hanno ridimensionato e oggi lopinione pubblica la pensa diversamente la politica veloce
6730799 decidete che ruolo ha litalia ieri cera lintervista di un ministro che parlava di trattato da stracciare roba da pompe funebri in passato per molto meno dallopposizione facevano un gran discutere secondo me questo un tema identitario questa persona pu essere ministro che segnale venti giorni dopo linizio della vicenda di governo
6730800 sono stupito dalla protervia con cui alcune cose vengono introdotte surrettiziamente inserire la normetta nel decreto con un emendamento non va bene preferisco un confronto parlamentare alto
6730801 il governo ombra avr il ruolo non solo di dire no ma di formulare proposte alternative come accade nei paesi dove previsto costituzionalmente come in gran bretagna
6730802 avevamo detto 48 ore ma abbiamo anticipato a 46 c stata la massima disponibilit di tutti e sono molto contento e soddisfatto non ci sar il ministero per i rapporti con il parlamento ruolo ricoperto dai capigruppo ma abbiamo deciso di avere un ministero delle comunicazioni a presidio della libert di informazione con giovanna melandri as proposito le donne sono nove su ventuno il 43 quasi quanto il governo spagnolo di zapatero
6730803 abbiamo informato il capo dello stato della nostra iniziativa politica per organizzare lattivit di opposizione attraverso il modello anglosassone
6730804 il pd non aspira ad essere autosufficiente ma a raggiungere comunque delle dimensioni tali a far si che esso sia il perno riformista di una possibile alleanza noi non siamo su una posizione di autosufficienza ha spiegato o su una che nega le alleanze ma qualsiasi alleanza deve avere un perno riformista che possa proporre un accordo programmatico poi potranno nascere delle alleanze sia a livello locale che a livello nazionale
6730805 non saranno pi alleanze contro ma alleanze su un programma sancito da un partito delle dimensioni del 33 34
6730806 si dimostra che il pd non intende arroccarsi in una opposizione sorda o cieca ma incalzare ogni giorno il governo con progetti e proposte che partano dai problemi del paese e offrano risposte alle aspettative degli italiani
6730807 auguriamo al governo ombra di poter svolgere al meglio il proprio lavoro
6730808 ricominciato afare hanno vinto le elezioni facendo leva sulla paura e su sicurezza ora fanno norme che per sal vare lo psico nano sospendono per un hanno i processi per reati che ora sono diventati poco importanti
6730809 chi interpreta il voto come unonda che tutto travolge sbaglia sia perch ci sar una opposizione robusta sia perch dimentica che il paese diviso a met visto che il 46 ha votato per altri e poi questa met ha le sue articolazioni e soprattutto deve considerare che il 47 degli elettori non ha votato per chi poi sar al governo
6730810 il pd ha dichiarato veltroni deve essere aperto alla societ e radicato sul territorio valorizzando gli eletti negli enti locali e deve prendere le sue decisioni non facendo riferimento alle sedi e ai luoghi tradizionali
6730811 solo se il pd continuer sulla strada di forte innovazione riformista a vocazione maggioritaria ha dichiarato nel corso del suo intervento potr costruire scenari di collaborazione anche pi intensi
6730812 given a suitable set of one to one and one to many agreements between the stakeholders in scientific research then the benefits of sharing could come to outweigh any conceivable advantage derived from secrecy perhaps open science could be defined for the moment as the quest to design and optimize these agreements along with the quest to design the best tools and licenses to empower scientists as they move from the status quo into the next system because and this is very important if it is to ever succeed open science has to work not because of governmental fiat or because a large number of people suddenly start marching in lockstep to an unnatural tune but because it works better than competing models

6730827 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6730828 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6730829 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this

6730927 evoluci n de las computadoras parece ser una transici n y ello se debe a que a n no cumplen con los paradigmas de esta nueva sociedad la movilidad la posibilidad de acceder y usarse en cualquier lugar inclusive caminando en un bar en el tren o en el subte

6731006 were looking at budget cuts next year 75 to 120 million if we could offset some or all of the cost of our fuel increase with something like this thats hard not to look at

6731008 6 when the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye and also desirable for gaining wisdom she took some and ate it
6731009 i heard you in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked so i hid
6731010 who told you that you were naked have you eaten from the tree that i commanded you not to eat from
6731011 the woman you put here with me she gave me some fruit from the tree and i ate it

6731017 susanna is in the roman catholic canon it is daniel 13
6731018 apocrypha that is books which are not regarded as equal to the holy scriputres and yet are profitable and good to read
6731019 as to the apocriphe bookes i omit them because i am no papist as i said before
6731020 as the church reads the books of judith and tobit and maccabees but does not receive them among the canonical scriptures so also it reads wisdom and ecclesiasticus for the edification of the people not for the authoritative confirmation of doctrine
6731021 that sounds a bit steep what can i get for a rib

6731030 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6731031 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6731032 observers from osce have been notified from tbilisi about invasion beginning but have not informed peacemakers of the russian federation as it is necessary
6731033 will not be capricious and obstruct work of observers from osce
6731034 a phrase in the three sentence draft statement that would have required both sides to renounce the use of force
6731035 despite the fact that he is adored in the west as an architect of democracy and credited with ending the cold war georgians cannot bear their president
6731036 get out of georgia we dont want trouble here shevardnadze is our friend
6731037 loudly proclaiming its support for georgias territorial integrity in the battle with russia over georgias separatist enclaves
6731038 may have felt that his military after several years of u s sponsored training and rearmament was now capable of routing the ossetian separatists bandits in the official parlance and neutralizing the russian peacekeepers
6731039 immediately transform the conflict into a direct confrontation between a democratic david and an autocratic goliath making sure the sympathy of the western world would be mobilized for georgia
6731040 at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
6731041 we have received formal notification via military channels that russia has decided to halt international military cooperation events until further notice
6731042 everything depends on nato priorities the priority is for unconditional support of georgian president mikheil saakashvili then we wont be to blame for the bankrupting of the alliances relations with russia
6731043 russia no less than nato relies on this mutual cooperation nato is much more in need of russias support of its military actions in afghanistan where natos fate appears to be in the balance
6731044 the pullback of russian forces is taking place at such a tempo that by the end of august 22 they will be in the zones of responsibility of russian peacekeepers
6731045 i didnt think it likely that a member of the un security council and the osce would react like this

6731054 its now clear that the economy will be the tipping point in this election
6731055 and the candidate who has the best answer to getting america growing again without inflation is going to tap the winning segment of this electorate
6731056 i like johns ideas but he has more to do in terms of making his case and connecting with voters on the economy
6731057 but has he effectively conveyed those policies in a way that votes will understand thats the challenge for his campaign
6731058 wir sind alle euphorisch das ist eine ganz herausragende leistung
6731059 ich war nach der h lfte des rennens schon total fertig aber dann dachte ich nur noch es reicht es reicht
6731060 das ist fantastisch und ein sensationeller erfolg f r so eine kleine stadt
6731061 wir haben es alle gehofft aber f r uns fachleute waren die ungarn ein ebenb rtiges boot

6731070 nobody on our side of the family had any clue the pair were facing problems within the marriage
6731071 as far as our family is concerned they portrayed a loving couple who wanted to spend the rest of their lives together
6731072 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6731073 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6731074 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6731075 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6731076 the starting salary for new cops will jump from approximately 36 000 to 42 000
6731077 the contract provides stability to a key labor force in our city
6731078 ive never been shy to stand on the steps of city hall and say when something is wrong

6731083 its the only dry way to get around its not like you can go jogging or anything
6731084 its so far so good im working on my thigh slowly but surely in the next two weeks i hope to start running
6731085 if you are out injured it takes a few weeks to regain your fitness i dont want to suffer the same injury again
6731086 im very very frustrated with whats happening all the teams strikers are out
6731087 were only left with two young strikers and while they are good they need some strikers with experience to help them along
6731088 he pulled a thigh muscle quite badly and the medical staff reckon he wont be available until into the new season
6731089 they have to wait for the muscle to heal and then for the strength to come back and that will need a lot of work
6731090 its a big disappointment for me but also for the lad himself because he was hoping to hit the ground running
6731091 benjani ended last season quite well and it is a shame but these things happen you will always pick up injuries in pre season you hope that they will be slight ones that players can get over but unfortunately this is a little bit more than that
6731092 the captain is injured but the technical committee are saying that he should come and give his teammates morale support in this big game
6731093 so we are trying to get him here but you need the clearance from his club for that and we will be engaging them shortly
6731094 weve entered a period of quite acute weakness thats unlikely to be short lived

6731097 the acquisition is expected to enhance aons capabilities in the significant florida and south east us property catastrophe markets as well as in the rapidly growing asia pacific and latin american regions
6731098 in addition the combination offers the opportunity to capitalize on the significant investment both businesses have made in risk modeling and analytics to create a global market leading capability in this key area
6731099 i have decided to leave shabanie mine for professional reasons
6731100 as a coach i have tried my best to produce good results and i think being second on the log is something credible because the club is still in the championship race
6731101 but it seems some people are still not happy with my performance
6731102 there is a lot of interference from some members of the executive and even some people from within the community
6731103 as a coach i am responsible for the results at the end of the day and cannot allow some people to dictate the way i select my team for the day
6731104 i would have liked to stay here but i cannot continue to work where some people who are supposed to be part of the team are hostile
6731105 we lost and i was questioned over the team selection for that game
6731106 the same team played and won 7 1 and still there were people who questioned the selection
6731107 maybe they wanted us to win 12 0 its funny that i am blamed for all the poor results but why does the executives interference be allowed to come in
6731108 if i cannot exercise my power as head coach then i would rather quit
6731109 when he came here mabika was advised to listen to all the people with an interest in the team and then take the best advice
6731110 there are certain ways of operating here at shabanie mine but mabika chose to be his own man and created enemies a lot of talk began to circulate that he had brought nothing new but in fact was destroying a good base built by chitembwe
6731111 if you didnt work full time you could take him to soccer yourself and he wouldnt have to carry all of his stuff all day like a pack mule
6731112 part of the reason he gets to do all of this great stuff is because you do work and i havent noticed any of your stay at home mom friends taking it all that easy
6731113 we were very busy last year so this jump in orders on the back of a good 12 months trading is seen as significant
6731114 i think the world is in for a surprise from these nigerian lads everything is working out the training is going on well and i think the boys will deliver that gold they can do so
6731115 we have worked on how they can do it argentines play with seven to eight men behind the ball they build up their attack slowly from behind with short passes they knock the ball to themselves deep in their half but suddenly they explode into such a speed that can beat any defense
6731116 the best way to play argentina would be to check their build up and try as much as possible to frustrate their acceleration since they start building from the rear the people to do that will be our attackers
6731117 the respondent be and is hereby interdicted from interfering with the applicants occupation of the premises as being number 18 buckingham drive eastlea harare
6731118 when we arrived here at the offices today yesterday we found that the invaders had already left
6731119 but what is worrying is that they vandalised the place damaging doors leading to the accounts offices and i suspect they have stolen some vital accounts books
6731120 it appears the safe has not been opened but we have to make a formal report to the police first and then undertake an audit
6731121 just by looking at the cabinet i can see that some of the trophies are not there
6731122 the door to the board of trustees offices has not been tampered with yet this war is about the boards and not information or whatever they want from the accounts department
6731123 it gives me the impression that these people are after money only
6731124 we cannot say what is missing and what is not because the bookkeeper is not here
6731125 so until we take stock we cannot tell you what is missing but it appears some accounts books are not here
6731126 they came on friday around 3pm and told me that they were the new owners of the club
6731127 i counted about seven of them with zhakata being their leader
6731128 they chased away the girls at the reception and ordered everyone out
6731129 during the day kamba and shaya would come to hold meetings with the young men who had camped in the offices
6731130 they assaulted me and took over most of the keys to the buildings and i saw them breaking down the doors at the accounts offices before they left
6731131 we are not taking any sides anyone who would be caught inciting violence over the issue will be arrested
6731132 we want them to disseminate the call for zero tolerance on violence to their respective supporters
6731133 if the violence persists we will arrest anyone who would be caught offside
6731134 the way things are going i dont think that should be the route that dynamos issues should take
6731135 why cant people sit down and iron out their problems in terms of the clubs constitution
6731136 i think with dialogue they can achieve better things but it seems the other faction led by shaya wants to be in power at all costs
6731137 i dont understand what it is that they want so urgently that they cannot use proper means to take over
6731138 i dont think chiminya wants to stay in office forever but people have to use proper means of removing him if they dont want him instead of violence and resorting to people who were suspended
6731139 all this should not be allowed to affect the team we should never get to a situation where this is left to affect a team that has shown so much promise
6731140 we are still talking to the authorities at raylton and we are also trying to get permission from the police as is required by the law of this country when it comes to such a gathering
6731141 but we are at an advanced stage and we are saying the voice of the true supporters not those who get free beers to cause trouble has not been heard and we want it to be heard
6731142 we cant understand this madness especially given the national assignments that the team faces and the challenge to retain the league championship and the big trophies
6731143 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011 said mr hammoud
6731144 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this he added
6731145 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders

6731155 the state will feel good about itself for offering something and the person of size will end up paying 300 a year for the bad luck of having a chronic disease his her state sponsored insurance program failed to cover in an appropriate and meaningful fashion
6731156 limiting the charges paid to the national grid by renewables generators on the scottish islands is vital if their vast potential is to be realised
6731157 the government continues to believe that cost reflective transmission charging is a sensible basis for charging
6731158 cost reflective transmission charging is where the users of the transmission system pay according to the cost of transmitting the electricity
6731159 in this way the operators take account of the true cost of transmitting electricity
6731160 we need a level playing field and this is utterly the wrong signal
6731161 its the wrong signal from a climate change standpoint from creating further downward pressure on energy prices and for economic recovery in scotland
6731162 we know that developers of wind farms in scotland dont even take projects beyond the drawing board because they know the transmission charges in the north of scotland and the islands are so severe
6731163 so its undermining investment in renewables in scotland i think particularly worrying is that fledgling technologies like wave and tidal will have to also pay these types of charges

6731170 demonstrated his desire to avoid the jurisdiction of this court
6731171 i will be making a submission to the court that this was a conviction obtained in the most appalling of circumstances
6731172 my client feels it was an unfair trial and a travesty of justice
6731173 we need to inquire whether this conviction should be recognised by this court
6731174 far far below what is acceptable in western european standards
6731175 therefore i decline to make an interim order as mr gadd has demonstrated his desire to avoid the jurisdiction of this court
6731176 mr gadd is pleased to be back in this country the last few days as you know he has been travelling around asia and that time was not wasted it enabled mr gadd and others to put into practice a plan for his proper and safe arrival
6731177 mr gadd is not a well man he needs medical attention and is also unsurprisingly concerned about his safety and these past few days have enabled the metropolitan police and i on his behalf to put into plan a proper procedure for his protection and his well being
6731178 mr gadd is pleased to be back for another reason because there is the possibility that for the first time he can appear before a court of justice
6731179 martin is the captain here i didnt say it officially to him but he is the captain of the side at the moment and i wouldnt see that changing
6731180 he leads by example im not saying he is running around shouting all over the place but then neither did gareth
6731181 he had this long term knee problem and it could have led to him giving up football but he showed his strength of character to battle back
6731182 he came back into the side for the final stretch of the season before last when we had a long unbeaten finish and since then has not looked back he has been excellent for us

6731186 its an incredible feeling to be olympic champion its been a long time coming
6731187 it was a fantastic race probably the most enjoyable race i have ever had and i am really pleased not just for me but for my coach friends and family who have given me so much support
6731188 im hurting i think i might have broken my hand and im cut all over

6731233 executives from rogers wireless are downplaying reports of reception issues with apple inc s iphone and research in motion ltd s new blackberry bold
6731234 patrick spence a vice president at rim didnt deny the reports of 3 g reception issues outright but cautioned that there are several possible reasons why individual users experience problems with any wireless device ranging from signal strength inside particular buildings to overcast skies
6731235 3 g is a relatively new technology and wireless in general isnt easy
6731236 rogers is now apparently trying to defuse the pr disaster with a 30 a month data deal subscribers can add to their voice plans
6731237 rogers communications has caved into consumer pressure and is offering a limited rollback of rates for the new apple iphone 3g being launched friday
6731238 the new rogers rate available only for subscribers who activate their phones before aug 31 is 30 a month for a six gigabyte data plan that can be added to new or existing voice plans with rogers but only if they sign up for a three year contract
6731239 customers around the globe have complained about dropped calls and other connection issues
6731240 such drops apparently occur when calls are handed off from the 3g network to a slower network such as at amp ts edge when 3g isnt available

6731254 to move into the next phase one of the issues were facing is to do the work how do we access the waters edge
6731255 the environmentalist will say no you dont stop erosion if you want the cathedral bluffs you dont construct erosion works but this is in the face of the people who have been allowed to build homes along those zones
6731256 so right now im sort of teetering on the edge of the bluffs

6731285 she will be missed by all who knew her and myself deeply as we shared so much in common our likes and dislikes
6731286 it is very sad that her life has been so short
6731287 she had a lot of hidden talent musically but was shy and lacked confidence in her abilities it was a secret that we shared and were working on
6731288 although her life was short she had more than a normal share of burdens and problems to contend with
6731289 she started every morning with a happy smile and a cheerful good morning
6731290 that morning greeting that she would give will always be remembered

6731361 i was very happy at liverpool and had no desire to leave but charles roberts his agent told me i should not dismiss the opportunity outright
6731362 when charles told me what napoli were offering it made my eyes water i was to receive 1m as a signing on fee
6731363 i was aware of my knees trembling and i nearly fainted when charles told me the bones of the deal
6731364 in addition to the signing on fee napoli was willing to pay me another 1m over a three year contract it was a thursday and the italian transfer deadline was 48 hours off charles told me that if i did not sign by saturday all bets were off
6731365 liverpool chairman john smith was in london watching the tennis at wimbledon and in the days before mobile phones charles didnt manage to get in touch until friday
6731366 mr smith told him he needed time to think and refused to discuss the matter until the monday morning which of course was two days after the italian transfer deadline
6731367 i managed to contact mr smith asked if i could come down to london to discuss the matter only for him to refuse point blank
6731368 though still not 100 per cent sure about whether i wanted to move or not i was angered by mr smiths reaction given the urgency of the impending deadline
6731369 the deadline came and went as a consequence the deal collapsed i then received a call from charles to say napoli had been in touch having been unable to speak to mr smith theyd had no alternative but to look elsewhere and had signed diego maradona
6731370 i was so upset with the chairmans belligerence and rudeness in not even returning napolis calls that for a long time afterwards i refused to acknowledge him
6731371 ironically when i eventually did go to italy three years later i did so for a fee of 3 2m without even taking inflation into account the club had let 1m slip away as to all intents and purposes had i
6731372 it had been some time since i had been in the managers office
6731373 the flock wallpaper had gone as had the flying ducks and the picture of the scrambling pigs fings werent what they used to be sitting alongside kenny was our secretary peter robinson
6731374 there are stories in the newspapers about you moving said peter well thats the newspapers for you i said dismissively its the close season you know how it is peter its the silly season for newspapers they havent got any news to write about
6731375 thats as maybe ian but those stories theyre true i literally flopped back in my chair i was totally flabbergasted i was being moved on my mind went blank with the shock news
6731376 peter went on to say that reluctantly the club were prepared to sell me
6731377 the european ban was having a severe effect on club finances and after much deliberation the club had agreed to sell me as a solution to a cash flow problem that would only get worse unless a sizeable injection of capital was generated
6731378 when platini retires at the end of 1986 87 we will recall you mr boniperti concluded
6731379 from where i asked becoming confused and not a little concerned
6731380 lazio replied mr boniperti we will sign you now and loan you out to lazio for the season then when platini retires you come back here
6731381 with all due respect no i said and i meant it lazio were at the time in serie b to me such a move would be akin to me leaving liverpool to spend a season at sheffield united or sunderland
6731382 ok if i have to go on loan what about this i suggested i sign for juventus and i go back to liverpool on loan for the season
6731383 the lawyer raised his eyebrows but i could tell by the slight sideways nod of his head he thought this a possible solution to the impasse peter robinson practically grazed his jaw on his shirt buttons at the thought of liverpool receiving over 3m but still having me for another season
6731384 i was immediately admitted to flint cottage hospital where i spent two weeks in a coma in an oxygen tent
6731385 obviously my recollection of this traumatic event in my life is very vague mum told me at one point it was touch and go whether i would survive or not i spent over a month in hospital
6731386 seemingly while on the road to recovery doctors feared i might suffer permanent brain damage fortunately that never happened though try telling kenny dalglish that
6731387 ironically there was a positive result from my being close to deaths door
6731388 before my illness i was a small but chubby lad having spent over a month at the cottage hospital during which time i hardly ate a thing i lost a lot of weight
6731389 when i was discharged i was very lithe and though i regained my appetite in no time and settled back to eating mums regular meals i never did put the lost weight back on again which was to serve me well later in life
6731390 throughout the 1970s my great musical hero was david bowie
6731391 he retired ziggy stardust only to become aladdin sane and i have to say i followed suit
6731392 at one stage i too dyed my hair orange then followed aladdin sane by changing it to purple on occasions i even sported the aladdin sane lightning flash across my face the only thing i didnt try to adopt was bowies bisexuality
6731393 i just did it to avoid getting a real job
6731394 the avp is not exactly thriving so anything that makes a difference would be good
6731395 it is up to the avp to capitalize on this
6731396 i dont know what they are planning but there is a lot of media attention on beach volleyball right now and they have to use it to better the sport
6731397 there is just not much incentive for those guys to move over
6731398 if i was asked i would tell them to play indoor set themselves up for life buy a nice house
6731399 then if they want they can retire to beach volleyball for a few years
6731400 his blocking was phenomenal and i just led the cheering and tried not to make mistakes
6731401 these guys have played at an incredibly high level for many years i still feel a little new to it
6731402 when steve mcclaren was appointed he rang me and asked me to return he also came down to training and asked if i fancied it
6731403 that meant a lot to me but i dont think i was ever that close that i would have said yes
6731404 yes it wasnt about thinking it was too much or i wasnt capable it was just that when i was playing i was not enjoying it one little bit
6731405 i am 34 in november and hope to still be playing when i am 35
6731406 whatever about the hats we dont want to see the anorak back
6731407 it is an operational matter and you need to contact the prison service
6731408 the incident is under investigation and we will not be commenting any further than that at the moment
6731409 the fact that one of the states most notorious knife criminals can be photographed in such a way makes a mockery of prison security
6731410 it was taken on a phone that should not be in prison i am concerned at the fact that she would be cleared as suitable to work with cleavers and knives in the kitchen
6731411 i would wonder at the nature of the assessment that cleared her it would appear by her demeanour that she is giving the two fingers to the prison authorities and the minister for justice dermot ahern
6731412 it must be hugely embarrassing for the minister whose government only last week spoke of an increased crackdown on mobiles
6731413 the acquisition is expected to enhance aons capabilities in the significant florida and south east us property catastrophe markets as well as in the rapidly growing asia pacific and latin american regions
6731414 in addition the combination offers the opportunity to capitalize on the significant investment both businesses have made in risk modeling and analytics to create a global market leading capability in this key area
6731415 were planning a big one man a real big one
6731416 were trying to get all the people we know that weve played with to come and sit in and play weve got confirmation on a bunch of em now youre gonna ask me who that is right
6731417 just think about all the people weve played with were shooting to get all of them of course people are on tour but not usually so much in march as they would be say in august
6731418 and had it not been a total emergency i wouldnt have done it this time but i just flat couldnt make it man they make you take this medication you might as well plan on staying home for half a year
6731419 its hell man its really hell but it worked i dont have all my strength back yet but im getting totally back up on my feet again and the shows have been wonderful

6731424 hes not going to be able to afford to stay in the sport
6731425 i get calls every day asking about the price if they dont like mine they go down the road and call the next guy
6731426 for a while more people brought in cars but the regulations are tough
6731427 i just like to see the cars crashing the excitement of whos gonna stop and have to sit there and wait whether theyre gonna get squished or not
6731428 its kill or be killed and you destroy him or he destroys you
6731429 at the end of the day any medal was beyond my wildest dreams i just came here to perform and stay true to my values and get stuck in and fight and thats what i was trying to do
6731430 unfortunately he didnt want to get involved he wanted to use the tactics that he did you might say a win is a win but at the end of the day everyone knows who theyre going to pay to watch
6731431 i couldnt have done anything more my preparation coming into this tournament was spot on
6731432 and im absolutely thrilled to be standing here not only an olympian but an olympic medallist
6731433 i dont like to know the score even in my corner i just like to get in there and fight and if i win i win
6731434 they negotiated in their own self interest not the communitys interest
6731435 whose resource center is it evans whose grocery is it evans this is a travesty we got screwed talk about a slave mentality
6731436 we are supporting pakistan i think everything depends on pakistan and on what are the concerns about security if they say everything is ok and the tournament can be held as per the schedule then we are with them
6731437 at the moment i can not answer this question let this situation come first there is a meeting via teleconference on august 24 in which everything will be decided
6731438 we take it therefore that tiago will stay with us
6731439 the market remains closed to us regarding players coming in like we already said some time ago now
6731440 i expect to catch that ball ive got to catch that
6731441 id been playing punto to pull all night and he hit it right where i was supposed to be
6731442 i could have buried that split finger a little bit better than i did
6731443 i could have bounced it a little bit more and gone for the strikeout and if i did who knows what would have happened i do everything to prepare myself to pitch but im not getting the results i want its frustrating
6731444 nicky ripped it pretty good and torii had a long ways to go
6731445 weve seen him make plenty of catches like that and im glad he didnt make it but hes as good as they get out there we got a little lucky there
6731446 it all starts with pitching and scott baker was really really good going up against mr lackey whos always really good against us
6731447 we knew we were going to be in for a battle and it was its a nice start to a road trip
6731448 lackey can bear down and make pitches in situations like that as good as anybody in the game
6731449 we missed some opportunities but in those opportunities you look over at the other side and you see whos pitching he didnt miss too many spots
6731450 when you hit it good you kind of have that look
6731451 but i know this park and the ball doesnt really travel at night i hit it good enough but at 387 feet its a little deep i guess that was tough to swallow

6731467 ive been there at blizzard since we started on wow and its been a very long and arduous journey
6731468 and to think about taking that journey again with the starcraft franchise is a little scary it makes an rts like starcraft 2 seem very achievable laughs
6731469 the thing you have to remember about the mmo genre especially now that the bar is set by games like world of warcraft wow has been in development since in some shape or form 1999
6731470 theres people on the wow team that have been on that team for nine years so theres nine years of technology and story and content that are created so the bar for entry into the mmo genre whether its blizzard or someone else is very high as a result
6731471 hey you with the training wheels have you been working on a resume
6731472 it looks like this dell mp3 player is backed by some pretty smart minds though i think it will fail nothing has really put a dent in apples market share and their have been some attempts that havent gone so well a k a the zune
6731473 when the only embodiment of this grand scheme is a story that was planted in the wall street journal and a story in businessweek anything is possible
6731474 the reality of it is dell has some really cool software in zing the middleware so thats promising but running an online music or media store is not like selling printers or notebooks or pcs at the lowest possible price but maybe im wrong maybe it doesnt matter about the experience and songs are just commodities for the people who pay for them
6731475 certainly apple could use some real competition but it would seem to me to be an extremely steep uphill battle that will be very expensive but then again i dont know
6731476 maybe the pc trolls will finally understand being an apple customer in most cases means being a happy customer
6731477 i think the fact that a lot of pc manufactures sell cheap computers affects these results after all i think many users are disappointed in their 400 laptop running vista of course apple sells at a level that brings more satisfaction another possible reason is all the bloatware and anti virus suites forced on pc users from the get go this in itself slows a perfectly good pc down
6731478 the companies that drop in acsi are all windows based it is very likely that vista contributed to it
6731479 not only is apple the beneficiary of this vista dissatisfaction the synergy between ipods iphones and its computer products has helped has well
6731480 nice gesture but not really worth much they should stop billing altogether and give a bonus three months starting from when they actually get working three free months of a crippled poorly functioning service is hardly worth being excited about
6731481 wow that is a great pr move apple really i havent ever had any problems but i gladly take the extra 60 days in addition to the 30 you already gave me and smacklin the service has worked great for the majority of us
6731482 its very rare unless theres some kind of systemic problem like the computer battery thing from a couple of years ago but even then youre still talking about events that are relatively infrequent its like getting struck by lighting
6731483 i wont hesitate no more no more it cannot wait im sure theres no need to complicate our time is short this is our fate im yours
6731484 wala naman its just that ugh is claudia rivera your mom

6731509 i felt manchester united had made up their mind to let him go before we were interested to maybe manchester city or to france so it was not necessarily us going in there and buying a player
6731510 its a good move for him and a good move for the club we are always looking to improve and he is another good player
6731511 we have a good squad as it is now and we know shaun can play in a number of positions
6731512 he had a good spell at celtic the first time so im sure he will do well again

6731527 you always find out whos been swimming naked when the tide goes out we found out that wall street has been kind of a nudist beach
6731528 what were seeing in business in our retail businesses or anything having to do with housing is even a further slowing down in june and july both in terms of credit experience where people first got in trouble with house payments and now credit card payments
6731529 in my judgment it wont be any better five months from now
6731530 that doesnt mean that the equity cant get wiped out and it almost has in a practical sense as institutions they dont have any net worth people who own their insured mortgages or own their debt nothing is going to happen to them the equity and preferred stock is another question
6731531 keep your eye on that building itll be coming down soon
6731532 the first known instance of fire causing the total collapse of a tall building
6731533 tons of molten metal was found 21 days after the attack
6731534 steel doesnt begin to melt until 2 700 degrees which is much hotter than what these fires could have caused
6731535 there are holes in this story that you can drive a truck through
6731536 dr steven jones found it in the dust that landed in the entire area of lower manhattan and he finds it in the chunks of previously molten metal from the towers
6731537 nist said that wtc 7 fell at 40 slower than free fall speed but it collapsed a lot faster than it would have if the structural supports were not all blown away at the same instant 40 slower isnt very impressive thats like arguing that a rock falling through concrete 40 slower than a rock falling through the air is perfectly normal
6731538 i wish that there would be a peer review of this
6731539 i think all the records that nist has assembled should be archived i would really like to see someone else take a look at what theyve done both structurally and from a fire point of view i think the official conclusion that nist arrived at is questionable
6731540 photos of the steel evidence about how the buildings collapsed the unexplainable collapse of wtc 7 evidence of thermite in the debris as well as several other red flags are quite troubling indications of well planned and controlled demolition
6731541 why would all 47 stories of wtc 7 fall straight down to the ground in about seven seconds it was not struck by any aircraft or engulfed in any fire an independent investigation is justified for all three collapses including the surviving steel samples and the composition of the dust
6731542 wtc 7 building could not have collapsed as a result of internal fire and external debris no plane hit this building this is the only case of a steel frame building collapsing through fire in the world the fire on this building was small amp localized therefore what is the cause
6731543 weve gotten no response at all to e mails phone calls or visits to the mayors office
6731544 we might not always agree but i think we want the same thing
6731545 theyve been reducing capacity without increasing capacity at other shelters
6731546 and not one person has moved into the citys permanent housing yet
6731547 its really hard to get homeless guys to organize when they began taking the beds apart we had to get serious

6731549 lengthy discussion covering climate change non proliferation and asia pacific relations
6731550 both mr rudd and senator obama agreed that australia and the united states would need to work closely to help shape the future global agenda in each of these areas he said
6731551 the shutdown will take 27 days starting from aug 21 theproduct import programme is under consideration
6731552 i cant confirm the figure 27 days because it will take ustwo to three days to wait for the system to cool down we willexamine the system on sunday
6731553 by monday we should know how serious the leaks are
6731554 the films address a number of themes in and around the area of hiv and aids including stigma discrimination gender violence multiple and concurrent partnerships
6731555 the power in these films is in the fact that the nature of hiv and aids is that it does not pick and choose according to race religion ethnic or language group and that in order for us to achieve an aids free generation we need to understand its nature and know that every single individual in this region has to be involved
6731556 the sadc region is the most affected by hiv globally according to unaids 40 percent of all people living with hiv reside in this region
6731557 in 2005 1 6 million of the 4 3 million new hiv infections occurred in the region
6731558 the adult hiv prevalence rate is estimated at almost 11 percent compared to the global average of just 1 percent confirming that this region remains the worst affected
6731559 we see this as an important development in our march towards complementing the efforts of government ministries and several organisations in the fight against hiv and aids which is impacting greatly on the family unit
6731560 the need for this development is based on the fact that about 19 percent of the child population in zimbabwe are orphans and a large percentage of these children have lost their parents to hiv and aids
6731561 our government launched the national plan of action for orphans and other vulnerable children which is being spearheaded by the ministry of public service labour and social welfare

6731575 no it is not possible because we have a full series in pakistan later this year

6731580 i remember looking at my right seeing a vehicle in the slip road
6731581 then i looked at the road and it was clear the next thing i saw the headlight and the grill in front of my windscreen and that was it
6731582 all i remember was the cars on the slip road but nothing more i definitely looked i would never cross the road if anything was coming
6731583 i would never risk my childrens lives i would never risk the children in the car

6731613 the achievement overcomes one of the major obstacles to the approved use of stem cell therapies
6731614 traditional culture of human embryonic stem cells requires the presence of animal or human serum derived products in the growth media for the embryonic stem cells to survive and grow

6731776 they are going to have to tell me to go away because its just not in me to quit

6731795 a violent education corporal punishment of children in u s public schools
6731796 more than 200 000 u s public school students were punished by beatings during the 2006 2007 school year
6731797 the other kids were watching and laughing it made me want to fight them when you get a paddling and you see everyone laugh at you it make you mad and you want to do something about it
6731798 all corporal punishment whether or not it causes significant physical injury represents a violation of each students rights to physical integrity and human dignity it is degrading and humiliating damaging the students self esteem and making him or her feel helpless
6731799 in the 13 southern states where corporal punishment is most prevalent african american students are punished at 1 4 times the rate that would be expected given their numbers in the student population and african american girls are 2 1 times more likely to be paddled than might be expected
6731800 i think people will be edgy about flying that aircraft because so much of the coverage focused on the aircraft type
6731801 the spanish may issue a factual summary with no interpretation it may take a month or so

6731807 suddenly the plane started to shake it was going from one side to the other untilit fell
6731808 later i just remember people on the ground smoke explosions and then i lost consciousness
6731809 i was saved by the paramedics its thanks to them that im alive i feel like ive been born again
6731810 the failure of one motor does not cause an accident im not so sure the engine failed the combination of causes will have to be determined
6731811 the pilot detected something when he took the plane off the runway he believed it was resolved if he decided to take off
6731812 the problem was located it was resolved and the plane was dispatched
6731813 the technician who inspected the plane was not able to repair the system
6731814 the solution was to disconnect it not to repair it
6731815 the accident may have been impossible to predict or there might have been negligence
6731816 if the take off was authorised without the fault being properly repaired there is clearly a legal responsibility
6731817 but that must all be cleared up before any decisions are taken
6731818 it will have to be seen which company did the inspection whether it is a company with staff from the same company spanair or from a subcontractor
6731819 and if it was the same company what official controls took place

6731898 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6731899 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6731900 i was informed that the leakage may have gone undeteced for over a five month period and that the leak was discovered may have during a scheduled overhaul
6731901 well see if the notices go out and well act accordingly
6731902 ich dachte mir es w re doch interessant einen comic ber jemanden zu machen der vorgibt jemand anderes zu sein und dann nach und nach nicht mehr unterscheiden kann zwischen sich selbst und der rolle die er spielt
6731903 one of my intentions with this series was to create a book that could handle any and every story i wanted to tell the cast of the book is a loose knit gang of crooks a pickpocket a hit man and a crooked cop for starters who each take center stage at different times this way i can do a heist story follow that with a revenge drama and then a prison breakout all while using the same characters and as each story unfolds the mysterious past that connects these characters is revealed so readers can watch the puzzle of their twisted history being put together
6731904 nur wenige leute wissen was eine gute kriminal story ausmacht man denke nur an die alten batman filme und so ziemlich jeden versuch in sachen film noir seit das kino farbig wurde das dunkle und das schmutzige ist nur fassade aber die innere finsternis die jede gute kriminal story enth llt und befreit findet nie statt deine geschichten sind haargenau richtig und wunderbar unerbittlich und das beste sie nehmen sich ernst und das mit erhobenen haupt
6731905 i think he will bend over backward not to give markets much to go on just ask yourself what has happened since the last federal open market committee meeting
6731906 inflation has picked up but some of the underlying components of inflation have moderated particularly oil what can he say
6731907 we have reviewed the health and safety arrangements at the county sites to protect the staff and residents using them the guidance given to mr wheeler reflects this
6731908 the access road is used by 32 tonne lorries servicing the site who are forced into the line of on coming traffic if they need to pass a pedestrian
6731909 im upset because it seems so ridiculous that youve got to use a car using petrol when youre trying to save the planet
6731910 it is so easy to go with my wheelbarrow across the footpath as it takes 20 minutes but it is a 40 minute drive in the car
6731911 there is a 5mph speed limit and if you keep to one side there is no problem i have never had a problem in the eight years i have been using the site
6731912 it is by the grace of the lord that we are able to speak to you
6731913 but there are some people who have access to the gmb who come and try to sell us maize at exorbitant prices
6731914 we are now surviving on umtopi alternatively we engage in barter trade a big goat can get you two 20 kilogrammes of maize
6731915 i have been coming here daily for a week and a half and they keep telling us that wagons bringing maize from south africa are coming today
6731916 when a few do arrive the grain is given to the same people who seem to be enjoying preferential treatment
6731917 the situation back at home is dire and our people are surviving on fruit and roots like wild animals
6731918 starvation is no longer confined to rural areas and it could be even worse here in town
6731919 some households are now going for days without a full meal because they have no access to the foreign currency needed to buy maize from the black market
6731920 last week a former zanu pf councillor from enyandeni collected 200 bags from the gmb and gave ten bags to each zanu pf official in the area for their own consumption
6731921 when the new councillor went to collect maize for the ward only 150 bags which are hardly enough for the community remained
6731922 i have since written to the governor angeline masuku to protest against this corruption which has become endemic but i have not received a satisfactory answer
6731923 there is no food it is a fact that the rural population especially in southern zimbabwe is in dire straits some of us with rural constituencies are afraid to visit some villages as people have not eaten for days
6731924 there can never be an explanation as to why there is no food when the country has the experience of mobilising and moving food into areas with acute shortages someone is not doing his or her job for political reasons
6731925 zimbabwe has become one of the worst man made humanitarian disasters of a new and hopeful century an estimated half a million zimbabweans have already died of starvation malnutrition and preventable diseases
6731926 a la fin de 2011 les troupes am ricaines se retireront dirak
6731927 il existe toutefois une clause stipulant que le retrait peut avoir lieu avant 2011 et que la pr sence peut tre aussi prolong e apr s 2011 en fonction de la situation cest sur quoi les deux parties se sont mises daccord
6731928 i would never dream of giving away the ending but i can give away what happened after the ending today i went to
6731929 i would never dream of revealing the ending of this movie but i do know for a fact that two years after they get married the couple in question gets a divorce

6731936 the precise contours of the network management practices at issue here including what equipment has been utilized when it began to be employed when and under what circumstances it has been used how it has been configured what protocols have been affected and where it has been deployed
6731937 by monday i fully expect comcast will go into federal court to block the fccs enforcement of its order
6731938 the basis will be that the fcc isnt a proper agency for court discovery
6731939 the fcc does not have the authority it is claiming with this order
6731940 when first confronted with these press reports comcast the nations second largest provider of broadband internet access services misleadingly disclaimed any responsibility for the customers problems
6731941 comcast later changed its account and admitted that it targets peer to peer traffic for interference
6731942 if the fcc had done nothing it would have provoked a stronger reaction from net neutrality advocates and given them real ammunition to lobby for a law
6731943 what it has done is just say to comcast you cant do this try again
6731944 we dont know what the fccs reasoning is here how it is deciding whether a company is violating net neutrality principals or not
6731945 this ruling has created a lot of regulatory uncertainty it appears to be saying that a network practice is reasonable if it is disclosed to the customer but then where does that leave which does disclose that it limits p2p access on its wireless network
6731946 comcast and several other commenters maintain a continual refrain that all network providers must manage bandwidth in some manner and that providers need flexibility to engage in the reasonable network management practices we do not disagree which is precisely why we do not adopt here an inflexible framework micromanaging providers network management practices
6731947 we will decide this on a case by case basis
6731948 been honest with its customers and the fcc and explained upfront how it was managing its network they are basically being slammed for their failure to truthfully disclose
6731949 these days there are fewer jobs due to stricter building regulations and the rising cost of materials
6731950 there have always been peaks and troughs in the construction industry but the peaks are much lower than they used to be and the troughs much deeper
6731951 we are trying to create a sense of community here its not all bad news
6731952 its a mans world all they have to look forward to is an evening meal of cheap grilled meat and plenty to drink and the freedom to sleep it off where they drop
6731953 i dont drink or smoke and the clothes im standing in cost less than 800
6731954 ive never had a pair of shoes worth more than 1 000
6731955 some people are working out of town but a lot have decided to sleep rough tonight
6731956 we dont allow any alcohol here so on a hot evening like this they prefer to drink outside and sleep in the park

6731963 these days the points standings theres going to be so much moving around with the points
6731964 im just going to play it one hole one shot at a time
6731965 i played well today i thought the scores werent going to be as low as they were
6731966 so my one under par round is not as good as i thought it would be but i thought i played well and ill take it i obviously need to make up some ground tomorrow and have a good day
6731967 youre just trying to get into the round and kind of build some momentum on your side
6731968 i hit two really good shots i hit it and i hit it exactly the way i wanted to and it went in that rarely happens i was surprised and excited
6731969 i was surprised to shoot so low i didnt have any idea what was going to be a good score out here
6731970 its definitely not that easy its perfect conditions youve got great weather the course is in perfect shape right now

6731997 as far as nato and isaf natos international security assistance force are concerned the allegations in le monde are completely unfounded
6731998 we deny the report we have no information whatsoever that would indicate that the french soldiers were killed by nato planes
6731999 is accounted for and none has been compromised a thorough inventory will be a part of this stand down
6732000 the issue of properly safeguarding biological agents and toxins has become a concern following recent developments in the 2001 anthrax case
6732001 while navy standards already meet or exceed those of civilian laboratories that handle the same materials the navy is taking proactive steps to critically self assess its programs
6732002 we put the last 25 000 mtvs on hold and i asked how is it that we got to this point
6732003 we are currently gathering data and information from marines returning from oif and oef
6732004 once all the data is collected and analyzed we will approach industry for possible new designs and or changes to the current body armor
6732005 would allow greater mobility with reduced thermal stress in high elevations thick vegetation and tropical environments
6732006 now the marines who are wearing the mtv repetitively dont like it so much
6732007 it is heavier it gives a little more protection that is one of the net positives with it we still need a lighter vest that gives us the same amount of protection
6732008 for the most part we think the vest has particular application in afghanistan because once again if youre climbing up and down mountains you want to be protected but you dont want to be weighed down so much that youre just going to be sapped
6732009 i like the idea of modularization as long as you had some pieces that you could add or subtract
6732010 personal protection should be just that its a personal choice at some point
6732011 a lot has to be left to the commander threats will vary in different locations
6732012 you may have a sniper threat in one place and a shrapnel threat in another you may have a commander whose force mainly rides to the fight and another one that has to climb up the side of mountains
6732013 that weve got these various types of armor vest is marvelous

6732018 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6732019 its not about our fear its about the people waiting in gaza you cant think about anything else
6732020 we need to relieve the burden on the va from routine health care
6732021 if you have a routine health care need take it wherever you want whatever doctor or health care provider and get the treatment you need while we at the va focus our attention our care our love on these grievous wounds of war
6732022 received consistently better care across the board including screening diagnosis treatment and follow up
6732023 ideologues like john mccain and george bush hate the fact that the va exists
6732024 they hate the fact that theres a functional example out there of the government providing better care at a lower cost than the private sector
6732025 the problem that the va faces now is that the bush administration failed to hire enough doctors and disability claims adjusters when they chose to go to war with iraq if these doctors had been hired the va would be an example of the government doing good work bush and mccain dont want the public to see that
6732026 if im driving a humvee in iraq and a roadside bomb explodes and i veer off the road and crush my arm and end up losing it and needing a prosthetic is that a combat wound according to sen mccain
6732027 if mccain would work to properly fund va care there would be no issue about a va card
6732028 mccain by wanting to give vets private care is walking away from the va and ignoring the problem
6732029 for every vet who would get a va card that would be one less vet using the va
6732030 would mean in a short period of time a smaller budget fewer locations and the eventual dismantling of the best health care system in the country

6732035 alright class may i have your attention we have a transferred student today and her name is yoshizawa hitomi please be nice to her
6732036 just call me yossie and the thing i hate the most is annoying people so dont bug me or ask any silly questions when its not needed
6732037 didnt i just say not to ask silly question and to answer your question its because i hate skirts
6732038 ok class settle down yossie please take a seat next to ishikawa rika shes sitting next to the window first row fourth seat
6732039 we heard that youre a talented detective and can break any case without a sweat in tokyo theres this ishikawa gang that has been smuggling in illegal cocaine and weapons and they made money through any illegal means
6732040 its easy to say that but we dont have any evidence everytime we sent spies they always end up missing or being killed so we want you to take this case
6732041 well if i say that this case is related to your sisters death
6732042 your sister died in a car accident however a witness saw ishikawa crews in that car so they might be involved with your sisters death
6732043 even though ishikawa kazuko is a dangerous man but he has a daughter named rika and he loves her a lot she goes to an all school girl named gakuhou high school we want you to get close to her and if you have a chance then investigate her father
6732044 ill accept this case but i dont want to wear a skirt
6732045 dont worry about that we can ask a permission for you to wear pants by the way change your name to hitomi to hide your idenity
6732046 so thats rika behind a scary father theres a cute daughter how ironic
6732047 we have a great deal of concern with what was put before us
6732048 why didnt they show some interest in completing that discussion months ago the whole purpose of that piece was to help them through these tough times and save jobs
6732049 we will go back to the table if abitibi can succeed and be successful and provide employment
6732050 when the people of this province offers up money to this company there has to be something in there for the people of the region
6732051 we have to look seriously at how much we pour into it
6732052 in the last two years there have been over 20 million in subsidies in one form or another weve been very proactive in our support we have been there but the question now becomes how much do you provide
6732053 theyre going to allow their membership to enjoy their last undisturbed weekend

6732056 we hopen dat er weinig bezwaren binnenkomen want dan kunnen we sneller onze winkels heropenen
6732057 while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of bio fuel
6732058 but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic
6732059 i would hope manx gas can continue to absorb what costs they can and that this remains the case at the end of the winter heating period
6732060 we have been assured by the company that the fuel cost adjustment will be reduced or removed if the amount they pay for gas falls
6732061 this could still be feasible but i am able to confirm that i am satisfied that the companys profits for the last accounting period are within an acceptable range
6732062 it is our job to ensure that consumers are being charged a fair price and that although gas is currently expensive there is no excessive profiteering
6732063 people need an escape from their daily troubles in times of economic woe
6732064 the flyers we distribute help get the word out and advertise the small rewards program a lot better than soldiers going out and telling the people about it
6732065 these munitions getting taken off the street is a good thing
6732066 it means that they cant be used against us later on
6732067 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
6732068 die is hier vroeger gemaakt en hoort echt bij deze werf vertelt peter trots
6732069 hij is weer teruggekomen en nu gaan we hem opknappen
6732070 vroeger werden deze schepen gebruikt om bloemen fruit en groenten naar de veilingen in poeldijk en honselersdijk te brengen
6732071 in de jaren vijftig was het een werktuig maar vlak daarna kwam het transport over de weg opzetten de schuit werd toen al snel verbannen naar de opslag
6732072 mensen willen wat nieuws vertelt de schipperszoon met zijn zwarte nagels en het vet nog aan zijn handen
6732073 met zon lage schuit kun je prima onder lage bruggetjes door
6732074 een veilingschuit is een uniek stuk zon boot maak je niet zomaar dat spreekt mensen op een of andere manier aan
6732075 dat ging namelijk aan de hand van een schets op schaal die vervolgens helemaal met de hand werd overgezet op het staal dat de body van de schuit vormt
6732076 wouldnt it be funny if i was next to him
6732077 ive been up since 6am may as well have a snooze
6732078 people come out and tell us that they appreciate us being there and they appreciate what were trying to do
6732079 and the ones who dont appreciate what were trying to do are usually the guys we are detaining at 2 in the morning
6732080 any murderer is going to have clout with a potential victim but the extremists are losing that with the people to a certain extent
6732081 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
6732082 they deny the holocaust where thousands of lgbt people trade unionists and disabled people were slaughtered
6732083 when you go there all your dreams will come true it is like a second switzerland on earth
6732084 my name is bharat singh he was a famous freedom fighter the british hang him
6732085 i looked over and the five man on their kickoff team was star running back tim hightower
6732086 we kind of came to the conclusion that your best players need to be on those units
6732087 i think after the richmond game we were close to being one of the best special teams teams in the conference
6732088 its an honor to be named but ultimately its preseason
6732089 but im excited for the season last year i did well and a lot of it goes to the team that i was on we didnt have any blocked punts going into the last couple weeks of the season
6732090 he should be a starter on every special team for us
6732091 im just trying to get on the field as much as possible
6732092 i got on the field last year after i recovered from injury and im hoping to stay that way
6732093 we have a lot of experience but we still have to go out and do it
6732094 vindicated i feel great i feel amazing i just won a gold medal
6732095 it was hard and this win wasnt just down to my goal
6732096 it was only achievable with the team we have and that we played for each other
6732097 but i feel stronger in the end i know it sounds crazy but im glad i went though it i learned a lot about myself
6732098 i asked two questions do you want to win yes do you need goalkeepers to win yes
6732099 we had to move on and this day you could see that we did it
6732100 this is such a reward for nine months of hard hard work and soul searching after the world cup
6732101 i have no idea why we cant win a final
6732102 its something im gonna keep asking myself for a long time you keep asking what you did wrong
6732103 again we had a chance to win the gold and again we let it slip away its hard to say why that keeps happening to us
6732104 we are not looking at the results but on how we play
6732105 soccer is not a matter of 1 0 or 2 0 its the way to find out the rhythm the match against norway is our key point in the tournament we found out our weak points and improved it thats why we stand here with the gold medal
6732106 i think i was leaning to my left waiting to dive to the left because the whole goal was open
6732107 and she ended up going right and i luckily kept some of my weight on the right
6732108 i dont understand why the ball wouldnt go in in so many games before we were able to score easily but today it wasnt the case
6732109 i just knew that i had to keep it low strike it hard and it went in
6732110 we said dont worry about making mistakes just go out there and play with confidence and be brave you could feel it every minute of that second half and in overtime we felt strong
6732111 brazil is a fantastic team and they have many great individuals
6732112 but they didnt put away their chances tonight we had one
6732113 the last seven to eight years its been pretty rough
6732114 i can pull in but i cant get out of the car
6732115 sometimes there is 10 piles out there and in the summer it is just abhorrent
6732116 not that i think the dog would hurt anyone but you dont know
6732117 she is nasty to me and shes nasty to the cops
6732118 part of the reason we took this apartment was because we were told we would have parking
6732119 they told me for a while that they were going to paint a line then all of a sudden this fence goes up
6732120 i feel that because they are an organization that helps the poor they knew that it was cruel to do this
6732121 i know it is their property but why couldnt they have put the fence in so that i could park and get out of my car
6732122 you go out there and you want to prove people wrong and get better
6732123 hes a smart quarterback and we believe if hes out there that he can make the right reads and do what tom does out there
6732124 youve got to react and thats part of playing the position and its part of being a good offense
6732125 i would say everything he would probably be doing hes done before it is just a question of fine tuning it working on timing and all those kinds of things
6732126 some of the practices that he hasnt participated in are still things that he has done before not new things
6732127 but to the extent if there are new things and the player misses those then we will need to catch him up on it because the rest of the team has got it
6732128 any time you can get into game situations and get out there and be in game speed its great for the development process
6732129 the more you do it obviously the more comfortable you become
6732130 hes always very supportive and points out things that he thinks that i could get better on and also points out the things that i did really well

6732156 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011
6732157 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6732158 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6732159 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6732160 the number of us military bases would depend on the size and the needs of the troops
6732161 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
6732162 the us has gone very far in this agreement it is a very advanced agreement
6732163 its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification or anything like that
6732164 a reinforcement of links between damascus and moscow amount to a very negative development
6732165 it would push syria to adopt an irresponsible and adventurist policy
6732166 would endanger peace in the world not only in the middle east
6732167 forceful return on the international stage doesnt guarantee in any way it will have a constructive role in the future of the middle east
6732168 it is difficult to believe in the good faith of moscow when it emerges despite all of moscows denials that russian weapons sold to syria have reached hezbollah
6732169 the only new element is that the israeli military aid given to georgia has given russia an argument to sell weapons to syria
6732170 has taken into account russian demands that it limit its military aid to georgia
6732171 is less important than that of the united states or france

6732182 dont get me started on the mozzarella stick she said
6732183 he worked extremely hard to put himself in this position to get back and help this club
6732184 and hes really excited about the opportunity and hes up to the challenge
6732185 i think our hope is that it is successful and that new holland and other major manufacturers begin to make them available to farmers so that a farmer can choose whether he wants to burn petroleum to make food or whether he wants to use his own crops to power production
6732186 and that journey if we do our part if we lend our hearts and heads to the campaign that lies before us that journey will lead us back to the white house
6732187 i am confident we will have a very strong party come out of denver
6732188 little gti youre so much fun i love to drive you
6732189 this is an exciting time for the group and with the huge expansion of the market we feel it is the right time to enter the publishing business
6732190 our unique distribution method means that platforms like the sony playstation 2 has at least another three years left in its lifecycle and we are in a position to benefit from this
6732191 i really like the combination of analysis behind the news that gamesindustry biz provides it taps into the brains and emotions of so many industry constituencies developers and publishers of course but also manufacturers government and financial players with so much volatility these days its important to be fully advised as well as informed highly recommended
6732192 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6732193 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people
6732194 the average household has its tv on for eight hours and 14 minutes daily thats a record
6732195 two of the silliest pieces i have read on ya literature in ages
6732196 heres an idea why doesnt everyone just grow up and stop talking about this and let teens read what they want whether a publisher designates it ya or not
6732197 i really have a problem with this book it shouldnt be on the shortlist let alone win
6732198 college guys talk about what theyre reading what they read in high school and what books are important to them now
6732199 this really does put a rate cut firmly on the agenda although it is unlikely to come until we have seen the peak in inflation

6732201 results were slightly ahead of our forecasts due to better than expected performance of the uk bus division
6732202 results were boosted by the contribution of the cross country rail franchise which started last year and the absence of rail bid costs
6732203 fuel costs are a challenge for us and the industry as a whole but they could cause more people to utilize public transport in the future
6732204 this wasnt a shooting that was a random act it was an individual directing his aggression toward another individual not the school or the students inside the school
6732205 he got shot and started walking and he was holding his chest there was blood everywhere and then he fell and his arm hit me
6732206 well weve established that the vanagon isnt exactly a race car
6732207 ruby dont drive your air cooled vanagon westfalia to town

6732209 i mean how cool is it when your everyday transportation can double as an apartment
6732210 t he case raises the broader policy and constitutional considerations that argue against using civil liability to control the behavior of pregnant women
6732211 expanded access to prenatal education and heath care facilities will far more likely serve the very real state interest in preventing increasing numbers of children from being born in to lives of pain and despair
6732212 as the president of the law review obama didnt write articles he edited and reviewed them
6732213 they probably dont want to have you reporters going back
6732214 like most second year law students on the harvard law review wrote an unsigned student case comment that summarized a recent decision by a state or lower federal court the piece analyzed a case in which a mother was sued by her child for injuries caused by the mothers negligent driving during her pregnancy senator obama concluded that in such cases the was correct not to allow lawsuits by children against their mothers
6732215 he wrote that the best way to protect the health of fetuses was to provide prenatal education and health care to pregnant women issues he remains committed to today and which he has worked to advance as a legislator and in this campaign
6732216 student obama was acutely attuned to the limits of the judiciary and of suits between children and their mother in this sensitive area
6732217 this is a modest and balanced piece that fits easily within the framework of the law at the time
6732218 involving maternal activities that might be considered intentional or reckless infliction of prenatal injuries on the fetus
6732219 imposing civil liability on mothers may be as likely to deter the carrying of pregnancies to term as to deter maternal negligence during pregnancy
6732220 fetal maternal tort suits might entail far more intrusive scrutiny of a womans behavior than the scrutiny involved in the discrete regulation of the abortion decision
6732221 on the other hand the state may also have a more compelling interest in ensuring that fetuses carried to term do not suffer from debilitating injuries than it does in ensuring that any particular fetus is born
6732222 when will silicon run out of gas can it fuel this exponential growth for 40 years to come
6732223 we got very close to the limit at 45 nanometers we were able to innovate our way out of what seemed an unsolvable problem weve got some challenges ahead of us it looks like 32 nanometers is on track but you go beyond that and it looks a little bit iffy
6732224 we think cmos will continue to be the workhorse for many years in the future

6732231 i am sure that any doonhamers travelling to the match will be a great advantage to the team and a great advert for the dumfries area
6732232 theres a whole generation of youngsters out there who have no idea what it is like to reach an all ireland final but the 17 and 18 year olds realise they are experiencing something very special
6732233 the tickets are distributed to the county boards and then they allocate them to their clubs
6732234 no concession will be made for the fact that waterford havent been in the final in 45 years
6732235 if we got 25 000 tickets wed sell them but we wont get anywhere near that
6732236 eventually were going to see a tremendous amount of waste heat recovery applications but thats 5 to 10 years off
6732237 we have to get to that 10 percent efficiency threshold to start making it viable
6732238 the market is a lot of wasted energy and that is by definition a zero cost feedstock
6732239 if energy prices keep going up the economics keep getting better

6732249 i went back in 1959 and never returned again until last sunday when i was guest of the gaa president nicky brennan
6732250 its the only way to go to croke park now i hardly had to walk a step i had a lovely lunch and i was able to watch the game in great comfort
6732251 the only change is at the two ends of the pitch the davin stand and the famed hill 16
6732252 in my day you couldnt put a hand on an opponent without being penalised and if you got hit youd be very slow to go down
6732253 i just dont understand why they do that instead of doubling on the ball
6732254 going around with bottles of water even for people just going for a walk is mental
6732255 id come home to marymount have my tea pack my kit and my pyjamas in the saddlebag of the bike and head off the 22 miles to stradbally where i would spend the night the following morning id head to mass then cycle the other 10 miles to dungarvan to play a match
6732256 because i came from the city id be the only member of the team to get my tea in lawlors then id join the team in the bar for a large bottle of guinness before cycling home
6732257 often i would head out to a dance at the olympia and dance until 2 30 in the morning now they are talking about hamstrings
6732258 we just went out and played until it got dark
6732259 we never spoke to each other on the pitch but off it we were the best of friends
6732260 but well see how it affects him in his head
6732261 i heard the bang and for a minute i thought it was something being dropped
6732262 he was shot at five to three but by the time the guards and the ambulance arrived and saw to him it was nearly four oclock before they left the estate id say we were waiting over half an hour for the ambulance
6732263 but what can they do when people dont want to give evidence it isnt bringing anything good to the town either and soon it will be like moyross down here
6732264 it is a terrible thing to shoot a child there were troubles before but they were settled among men women and children were left out of it this is something different
6732265 it is an awful strain on everyone around here on the settled community too

6732267 it is very humbling to be elected as the youngest ever master of the holy ghost hospital and i am very conscious of the huge responsibility involved
6732268 niall did tremendous work as master and was wholly committed to the role contributing very significantly to planning how best to manage the facility from the end of this year when the sisters of st john of god retire after almost 100 years of day to day involvement by the order
6732269 we are currently in the recruitment process for a lay manager who will oversee the 58 bed residential care facility from january next with the three remaining sisters who work there retiring at the end of this year niall had a clear vision for where we need to go next and i now take up the baton to deliver on that vision

6732273 nadie puede considerar que se encuentre cerca de la zona de conflicto

6732307 its a game thats big for the fans i guess its for a little braggin well they have the ultimate braggin rights they won the super bowl
6732308 they accomplished something that a lot of teams werent able to do they played a great team that had a lot at stake also to see them actually be the underdogs they were and go out and perform they way they performed was eye opening i was amazed by how they played
6732309 i watched all of that they achieved something that every player wants
6732310 to be able to watch it not be a part of it but be a witness of it that was a good thing
6732311 brett favre brings an added dimension of his own as far as his notoriety and his fame he has a lot of fans
6732312 so this game will be big itll be a good lead up game to the start of the regular season
6732313 they got us last year in the regular season pretty good
6732314 we jumped out on them pretty quick and they came back on us it was a difference from preseason to regular season
6732315 they have great players out there theyre a great team now theyre just like every other super bowl winning team trying to get it again this year trying to repeat but i dont see any cockiness on their side

6732322 ik had gehoopt dat er elke dag een viering zou zijn dit is tenslotte het olympisch dorp religie is belangrijk voor atleten en ik ben ook verbaasd dat het zo in een achterafhoekje zit
6732323 de eerste preek die ik voor een dienst in het olympisch dorp had voorbereid ging over coaching in veel opzichten voel ik me verwant met coaches de preek ging erover hoe jezus een coach was voor zijn discipelen
6732324 het is fijn om hier een kerk te hebben ik had gedacht dat het centrum wat groter zou zijn maar het was goed zo intiem
6732325 ik wist eigenlijk niet dat er christenen waren in china ik dacht dat het een communistisch land was en dat is het natuurlijk ook maar het was een interessante ervaring

6732365 by failing to hold a public presentation before submitting the applications as is the norm when dealing with a project affecting maltas premier national monument the foundation clearly looked upon the publics interest as unwelcome and uncalled for trespassing on the hallowed grounds of
6732366 far from being based on speculation faas stand on the st johns case has been arrived at after researching the information available attending the foundations presentation widespread consultation and studying the mepa file and plans three times just as faa committee members are not experts in the matter neither are the members of the foundation on this subject faa is also echoing the views of other entities including mepa the superintendence of cultural heritage the valletta local council and the church cultural heritage commission
6732367 by preparing communal objections to the project faa makes it possible for the public to participate in the planning process a right established by the eu directive on public participation as well as the aarhus convention which the foundation is obliged to respect being partly appointed by the state submitting identical objections does not make them any less valid however the foundations dismissal of the voice of the public is downright patronising and arrogant a totally inappropriate response coming from an entity that is partly church run
6732368 the foundations disdain of their committed objections is an insult to the maltese public

6732395 thats one of the things jerricho did early in his career
6732396 talking about him with people who were here you could put jerricho where you needed him and he did it well thats one of the positives about marcus

6732403 los familiares se cuestionan la decisi n de volar tras un despegue fallido
6732404 a primer vista todo cuadra las im genes de los restos humeantes de un avi n siniestrado y las noticias sobre un fallo en el motor durante el despegue tras el siniestro de un avi n de spanair en madrid para muchos parece claro que la compa a ha ahorrado donde no deb a es decir en seguridad en efecto dos d as despu s del accidente resultar a muy precipitado desechar esta explicaci n pero tambi n es demasiado pronto para considerando los hechos llegar a la conclusi n prematura de que los programas de recorte de gastos en el sector a reo siempre suponen consecuencias peligrosas para la seguridad
6732405 pero a pesar de lo urgente que pueda ser la necesidad de ahorrar las l neas a reas que como spanair pertenecen a la alianza de tr fico a reo star alliance no cuentan con un margen de maniobra en el mbito de la seguridad los socios de star alliance est n sujetos a un sistema de control especialmente meticuloso tambi n spanair se someti a principios de 2007 a un escrupuloso an lisis seg n los criterios de la asociaci n de transporte a reo internacional iata cuando se recortan gastos esto se lleva acabo en mbitos completamente distintos la semana pasada los espa oles dieron a conocer su intenci n de tachar una serie de conexiones con diversos destinos as como de recortar dr sticamente su flota y de despedir a una tercera parte de sus empleados esto no es ninguna garant a de que spanair no sea responsable del accidente pero a n es muy pronto como para condenar a esta compa a
6732406 volar es hoy m s seguro que nunca pero cada fallo puede suponer una cat strofe
6732407 cuando una pesadilla se vuelve realidad las personas buscan explicaciones si un avi n se estrella como ha ocurrido ahora con un modelo del socio de lufthansa spanair en madrid los observadores suelen tener a mano r pidamente una posible explicaci n la compa a a rea habr ahorrado en mantenimiento y seguridad en el caso de los aviones ch rter en apuros econ micos cr nicos esto tampoco puede ser de otra manera las ansias de obtener respuestas sencillas son compresibles sin embargo a menudo estas ansias no se ven satisfechas
6732408 en la mayor a de los casos las primeras hip tesis en casos de accidente a reo suelen acabar desvel ndose como err neas los responsables del an lisis de estos siniestros suelen encontrar los aut nticos motivos tras a os de trabajo minucioso y en ocasiones los familiares de las v ctimas se ven obligados a vivir con la incertidumbre de no conocer la raz n del accidente tampoco en el caso de spanair hay nada claro por el momento una maniobra de reparaci n antes del despegue tal y como se llev a cabo en madrid no es nada ins lito
6732409 madrid el d a despu s el accidente ha costado tantas vidas que solo caben en una nave de un recinto ferial a n no est n todos identificados y tambi n en alemania hay familiares que temen por los suyos pero ya ahora est claro que spanair tiene que dar muchas explicaciones
6732410 cuando prosiguen las minuciosas investigaciones sobre el accidente del avi n de spanair en el aeropuerto de madrid la segunda aerol nea m s importante de espa a se concentraba en la tragedia humana pero todo esto tambi n podr a tener serias repercusiones para spanair cuyo futuro estaba siendo cuestionado mucho antes de que el vuelo jk5022 con destino a las islas canarias tuviera su tr gico final
6732411 el impacto que el accidente dio a la imagen de spanair podr a sin embargo suponer otro golpe para la aerol nea dentro del altamente competitivo sector de transportes espa ol spanair declar ayer que algunos pasajeros hab an cancelado sus vuelos con la compa a tras el accidente pero que la mayor a de sus servicios estaban siendo prestados ci ndose a lo ya programado tanto los ejecutivos de sas como de spanair se mantuvieron firmes asegurando que la seguridad no hab a sido sacrificada por su necesidad de recortar gastos
6732412 los pasajeros aterrorizados fueron obligados a permanecer en el defectuoso avi n del accidente
6732413 un pasajero que falleci en el desastre a reo de madrid comunic a su esposa antes el despegue que hab a algo que fallaba en el avi n pero que se le neg el permiso para bajarse la acusaci n de que la tripulaci n se neg a permitir que los pasajeros bajaran del avi n se produjo al mismo tiempo que spanair defendi su decisi n de permitir que el vuelo jk5022 realizara un segundo intento de despegue toda vez que el primero fue abortado
6732414 los investigadores gubernamentales examinaron las dos cajas negras para la obtenci n de pistas y esclarecer las causas del accidente las conclusiones se dilatar n debido a que una de las cajas se encuentra da ada ayer la indignaci n iba en aumento ante la posibilidad de que spanair optara porque el avi n realizara el vuelo a pesar de haberse detectado problemas
6732415 un error humano no fue la causa dice un experto
6732416 el accidente del aeropuerto de madrid podr a haber sido causado por un problema con el motor izquierdo del aparato que lanz piezas met licas que da aron la cola y el motor derecho seg n manifestaron ayer fuentes de aviaci n civil espa ola
6732417 los familiares se cuestionan la decisi n de volar tras un despegue fallido
6732418 las explicaciones que dio spanair no fueron suficientes para acallar la rabia de los familiares que se reunieron en el tanatorio improvisado instalado en ifema para el reconocimiento de los cad veres la investigaci n sobre las causas del accidente podr a durar varios meses e incluso a os no obstante los investigadores creen que podr an recuperar los datos necesarios para determinar qu ocurri en los instantes finales del vuelo jk5022
6732419 mar a teresa fern ndez de la vega vicepresidenta del gobierno tambi n manifest que hab a im genes de v deo del accidente que estaban comenzando a estudiar los investigadores los responsables de la compa a a rea se negaron a discutir las posibles causas del accidente antes de que se realizara la investigaci n
6732420 a pesar del accidente de madrid volar sigue siendo m s seguro que nunca
6732421 con los aviones modernos rigurosamente controlados y con tripulaciones exhaustivamente entrenadas los riesgos de volar son con diferencia mucho menores que viajar por tren o carretera
6732422 no se preocupen no volver a ocurrir el accidente a reo de madrid que mat a 153 personas de los 172 pasajeros que estaban a bordo del md 82 de spanair no se repetir las estad sticas muestran que un hecho semejante sencillamente no ocurrir en un futuro pr ximo
6732423 lucha desesperada por identificar cad veres carbonizados mientras lso familiares piden justicia
6732424 los responsables de spanair declinaron hacer comentarios sobre las posibles causas del accidente alegando que era demasiado pronto para hacer especulaciones a adieron que cooperar an totalmente en la investigaci n judicial de las cuasas hecho que podr a demorarse meses
6732425 un avi n de la compa a spanair se prendi fuego tras salirse de de la pista de despegue en el aeropuerto internacional de madrid
6732426 r pidamente las autoridades acudieron al lugar del accidente siendo el primero en llegar el alcalde de madrid alberto ruiz gallard n seguido de la minsitra espa ola de fomento el presidente del gobierno jos luis rodr guez zapatero interrumpi sus vacaciones para personarse en el aeropuerto
6732427 esta filial de sas no tiene fama de descuidar sus aparatos para trabajar con el sistema de bajo coste a cualquier precio pero actualmente se enfrenta a serios problemas econ micos vinculados a la subida de precios del petr leo
6732428 los testimonio recogidos sobre los primeros instantes del vuelo son contradictorios hay que esperar a la informaci n que recojan las cajas negras que analiza la comisi n de investigaci n espa ola los investigadores podr n deducir de su estudio si el incendio del motor fue causa o consecuencia de la aver a y si otros sistemas como los mandos de vuelo hidr ulico se vieron afectados
6732429 no hay jada que permita incluir a spanair filial de sas en una lista negra

6732434 no hay nada que cuestione la seguridad del la l nea a rea en el accidente que se sald con 153 muertos el mi rcoles pero el drama se produce en un momento cr tico para la compa a los principales responsables de spanair se esforzaron ayer en disipar dudas enguanto a la estricta observancia de las normas de seguridad durante los instantes precedentes al drama los pilotos de la compa a empezaban a denunciar presiones destinadas a hacerlos trabajar m s horas de las reglamentarias
6732435 spanair y sas en el banquillo de lo acusados tras la cat strofe de madrid

6732438 las dos cajas negras del md 82 ya han sido recuperadas y los datos que encierran deber an permitir que los investigadores determinen con precisi n los ltimos movimientos de la aeronave para definir as las causas del despegue abortado
6732439 han sido decretados tres d as de luto nacional en memoria de las v ctimas del accidente a reo s lo 50 cuerpos han podido ser identificados hasta la fecha a n se desconocen las causas exactas ayer espa a segu a en estado de shock tras la terrible cat strofe a rea que caus 153 v ctimas en barajas las horribles im genes del suelo calcinado y del baile de ambulancias suscitaron entre muchos espa oles el doloroso recuerdo de los atentados del 11 de marzo de 2004 en la capital sobre este misterioso accidente a reo planean numerosos interrogantes
6732440 el tr gico accidente ocurrido el mi rcoles podr a precipitar la ca da de la compa a a rea ayer las acciones de sas bajaron hasta un 8 y la jornada se cerr con un p rdida de 6 62 puntos en la bolsa de estocolmo esta circunstancia no constituye un buen augurio para un grupo en dificultad como sas
6732441 investigaci n sobre la breve reparaci n del avi n de la masacre
6732442 las respuestas est n en la caja negra del md82 el gobierno de zapatero ha formado una comisi n t cnica para aclarar cuanto antes lo ocurrido ning n experto puede sostener seg n el presidente de la asociaci n espa ola de mantenimiento de los aviones que el calentamiento excesivo de una toma de aire que retraso el despegue admitido en conferencia de prensa por el vice director general de spanair est en relaci n con el incendio del motor adem s seg n los expertos el incendio del motor izquierdo no es suficiente para justificar la cat strofe por eso es crucial el an lisis de un v deo en que se podr an ver detalles del accidente sobre todo relativos a una explosi n despu s del supuesto incendio del motor izquierdo que actualmente lo est estudiando la comisi n del gobierno seg n declaraciones de la vicepresidenta
6732443 quedan en pie otras dudas referidas a la posibilidad de un error humano o a la intervenci n de factores externos condiciones atmosf ricas etc la crisis que atraviesa spanair ha desatado una pol mica period stica el titular de ayer en portada del peri dico el mundo relaciona la crisis de la compa a directamente con la tragedia una hip tesis que nos parece demasiado atrevida ya que el avi n md82 a pesar de ser viejo super sin dificultad todos los controles de seguridad previstos
6732444 la hip tesis de los t cnicos y de los pilotos italianos la edad del avi n m s importante la crisis de la compa a
6732445 hay que esperar los resultados de la investigaci n para comprender las causas de la tragedia el presidente de enac instituto nacional para la aviaci n civil de italia vito riggio afirma que no existen grados distintos de seguridad entre las compa as los vuelos low cost son tan seguros como los otros y spanair es una de las compa as m s seguras porque ha superado siempre los controles pero constata el periodista en verano los riesgos aumentan los vuelos est n llenos y el personal operativo trabaja al l mite una compa a en crisis por ahorrar no ser a capaz de reducir los gastos de mantenimiento y hacer despegar vuelos con dificultades t cnicas aparentemente superficiales con la complicidad de los pilotos
6732446 da os al tim n y a los motores el avi n estaba fuera de control
6732447 hay un v deo la vicepresidenta nos ayudar a comprender
6732448 hay dos investigaciones en curso sobre lo ocurrido una judicial y otra de la agencia espa ola para la seguridad de los vuelos la vicepresidenta del gobierno asegura que la verdad saldr a la luz gracias a un v deo que la comisi n est estudiando un an lisis de la aviaci n civil a partir de los restos del avi n hace una reconstrucci n posible de lo ocurrido incendio del motor izquierdo que destroz ndose da a el tim n y el motor derecho hay contradicci n entre las declaraciones de spanair y los t cnicos del mantenimiento la compa a ha declarado una aver a en una toma de aire los t cnicos dicen que estaba averiado un sensor que calculaba la temperatura externa tambi n preocupa que ayer otro md82 de la spanair tuvo que realizar un aterrizaje de emergencia
6732449 la compa a reconoce un problema t cnico pero asegura que hab a sido reparado
6732450 hay muchas hip tesis de la tragedia algunos testigos oculares hablan del motor izquierdo y otros aseguran haber o do una explosi n pero hay que esperar las conclusiones de la comisi n de investigaci n para saber la verdad con certeza estalla una pol mica porque los familiares de las v ctimas acusan a spanair de no haberles avisado del accidente ni haberles dicho nada sobre las indemnizaciones a pesar de que la compa a ha garantizado que pagar lo que debe
6732451 los familiares de las v ctimas del accidente a reo del mi rcoles en barajas madrid est n indignados con spanair el gobierno de zapatero prometi ya una investigaci n al accidente que hizo 13 muertos y 19 heridos las v ctimas extranjeras son de 11 nacionalidades y no hay portugueses
6732452 en el aeropuerto de barajas los aviones suben y bajan entran y salen turistas y otros viajantes los heridos recuperan los muertos son conducidos al cementerio se normalizan los escenarios despu s del accidente
6732453 en lo que dice respecto a spanair en particular es bueno recordar que en accidentes fatales de grandes dimensiones normalmente hay alguna contenci n por parte de la compa a a rea implicada sobre todo en los d as inmediatos por ello es razonable que suceda lo mismo en el caso de la transportadora espa ola a n as despu s del impacto inmediato que normalmente tiene un periodo de vida corto la forma en como todo se desarrollar en el futuro depender de otros factores especialmente como es recibida la marca en el mercado o como la compa a tratar con el post accidente

6732524 lets not have the kind of stalinist politics that the state of new york the republican party has been practicing
6732525 this move by the mccain campaign completely contradicts everything john mccain stood for in 2000 when his competitors were trying to keep him off the ballot
6732526 mccain has become a part of the same corrupted machine he spoke vehemently against only eight years ago
6732527 this is america where people have a right to run for office and a right to compete for the chance to lead the people of this nation
6732528 i look forward to the chance to compete fairly against senator mccain for votes in pennsylvania and every other state
6732529 you might expect of a dictator in north korea libya china or iran
6732530 this move is certainly one of the more brazen attempts to lock me out of the political process
6732531 but it is simply just one more example of how the political establishment desperately clings to their own power instead of empowering the people the political establishment serves only themselves and not the people of this nation it is time candidates for the most powerful position in the world compete based on ideas and not dirty politics
6732532 i challenge senator mccain to forcefully and publicly instruct his agents to drop the lawsuit

6732534 the ineffable joy that can be had in pursuing the absurd
6732535 my head was so full of words that i often had trouble forming simple sentences out loud
6732536 and my speech became a curious jumble of obscure words and improper syntax
6732537 some days i feel as if i do not actually speak the english language
6732538 like trying to remember all the trees one sees through the window of a train
6732539 i find myself wondering why ive never seen this odd term that describes such a common article of clothing

6732544 recently some special interest groups have claimed without providing any scientific rationale that some methods of contraception may have an abortifacient effect
6732545 no direct evidence exists showing that implantation is prevented by progestin only methods
6732546 the evidence does not support the theory that the usual mechanism of action of iuds is destruction of fertilized ova in the uterus
6732547 even though the precise mechanism of action of modern contraceptive is not yet fully known scientific evidence suggests the main mechanisms of action for each method inhibition of ovulation and effects on the cervical mucus are the primary mechanisms of the contraceptive action of hormonal methods evidence indicates that the primary mechanism of action of iuds is the prevention of fertilization
6732548 all of these methods directly or indirectly have effects on the endometrium the lining of the uterus that might prevent implantation of a fertilized ovum
6732549 so far no scientific evidence has been published supporting this possibility
6732550 insufficient evidence exists on whether cellular or biological changes in the endometrium could actually prevent implantation
6732551 the possibility of fertilization during combined oral contraceptive use is very small hence endometrial changes are unlikely to play an important role if any in the observed contraceptive effectiveness of combined oral contraceptives
6732552 currently the claim that hormonal contraceptives birth control pills implants norplant injectables depoprovera include an abortifacient mechanism of action is being widely disseminated in the pro life community
6732553 the presumption that implantation of a blastocyst is thwarted by
6732554 the hormonal contraception is abortifacient theory is not established scientific fact it is speculation and the discussion presented here suggests it is error
6732555 if a family weighing all the factors affecting their own circumstances decides to use this modality we are confident that they are not using an abortifacient

6732604 what i went through to get them is very special to me and really touched my heart
6732605 it is almost just a relief youre just trying to please the person who has taught you eveyrthing you want to show them that you can be just as perfect as theyve trained you to be youre afraid to make mistakes youre afraid to let them down even though you wouldnt
6732606 for him to have told me that that as long as i went out there and did my best and he knew i had done my best no matter what happened he would have been happy it made me have a lot more confidence in myself because i knew if i went out there and made mistakes it wouldnt be the end of the world
6732607 i think that is so helpful to her that he gives her permission to be imperfect to be human
6732608 its as simple as go do your best and truthfully thats all anybody can do
6732609 she knows i care about her seeking perfection i care about how she hits her routines beautifully but there is no pressure if she is making mistakes from me or li his wife

6732613 im very proud of what she does on the floor

6732619 its notable that suddenly with output rising opec officials are concerned about adherence to quotas and oversupply

6732641 peacekeepers at special checkpoints in the quantities needed to ensure security will remain
6732642 we have to understand the essence of what this means to have checkpoints in and around georgian territory by russian forces
6732643 it means there will be an effort by the russian federation to continue to make sure that the georgian economy is never rehabilitated
6732644 there are some checkpoints where one day they are federal troops and the next day peacekeepers

6732652 but we have to wait for the downloading and the analysis
6732653 the heating problem was treated and corrected by spanair maintenance personnel
6732654 the fault was isolated and the aircraft was dispatched for flight
6732655 we have reviewed the details on this faulty situation with the inspectors of our civil aviation authority and we all come to the conclusion that there was nothing abnormal in this resolution of that problem

6732666 wreckage was strewn for about a mile down the beach
6732667 this is a good scheme for servicemen and women to maintain their fitness levels while home on leave
6732668 this shows fantastic support from neath port talbot council to service personnel
6732669 it is greatly appreciated by all of us and we thank them for this superb gesture
6732670 im sure this will be taken up by members of all three services and it would be great if this initiative is supported by other councils throughout the country

6732674 growing with our blue chip companies and our direct investment activities temasek now owns a net portfolio of about 185 billion singapore dollars 131 billion at market value as at end march
6732675 it was a pretty difficult period in global equity markets for sure i suppose they were pretty clever

6732681 i hate to disappoint people but the answer is no
6732682 i did say that ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6732683 i wont comment on anything else until i introduce our running mate to the world
6732684 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6732685 today it is senseless to speak of the republic having its own industries
6732686 the governor is tremendously pleased we wanted a long term solution
6732687 allow public texas based investment funds to invest directly in texas transportation projects that offer a potential solid long term return
6732688 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6732689 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6732690 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6732691 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6732692 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6732693 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6732694 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6732695 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6732696 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6732697 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6732698 if you trust every web site but not a government
6732699 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6732700 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6732701 from the beginning our primary goal has been to make sure that every south dakota child receives their constitutional right to an adequate education regardless of where they live we will continue to fight for that objective even if the school districts are unable to support this cause
6732702 i think it does mean they are going to have to find a new source of funding involving non taxpayer dollars
6732703 we continue to believe that independently elected school boards have the right and the duty to protect the constitutional rights of the children within their district

6732705 its the only dry way to get around its not like you can go jogging or anything
6732706 it means more good paying jobs for skilled mississippi workers and again puts mississippi in the forefront of producing energy products for which there is a growing worldwide demand
6732707 we have so much going on we want to put it into context
6732708 theres a huge demand for skilled labor from texas to florida
6732709 we intend to follow our normal practice of doing more than is required
6732710 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6732711 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6732712 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location

6732714 ive just got round to assembling a complete pdf file of my 12 kleine pr ludien 2006 a compositional project somewhat associated with my new music blogging this collection of 12 pieces with two alternatives as circumstances require is intended cheerfully for domestic music making the collection may be played in whole or in parts and if played in whole i prefer the printed circle of fifths order beginning with ab and ending with c the premise here is the notion that a prelude is a cadence elevated to a minor epiphany feel free to download it
6732715 retailers tell us when our store is full of iphone users we know its going to be a good quarter
6732716 nationwide and state farm have been misrepresenting the amount of coverage they owe mississippians with total losses from katrina
6732717 were not talking about small money were talking substantial amounts
6732718 according to the plaintiffs the difference can be as much as 15 percent or as little as 3 percent of the coverages to which this inflation provision applies
6732719 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6732720 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6732721 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6732722 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6732723 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6732724 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6732725 there are arrows painted on the street highlighting the direction in which people are supposed to ride
6732726 how many times have you driven down the road and seen a bike rider heading in the wrong direction it happens to me all the time
6732727 i have a new driver in the family and it is very disconcerting to have her stop at the end of the street look in the direction of oncoming traffic for any cars and then be surprised to find a bike rider heading toward her from the wrong and unexpected direction
6732728 maybe then the republicans and democrats would get along and get something done
6732729 it is an eyesore for the balloon championships in july
6732730 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6732731 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6732732 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6732733 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

6732736 were not going to turn on a switch one day and suddenly our audience gets 100 times bigger its really our plan within the closed beta to get a very high number of peak concurrent users and we expect in the later phases of the closed beta to be about as big as bad company is today in terms of online numbers were going to have a very large closed beta almost to the point where every hardcore gamer in the world will probably be able to get a key if they want to it would just be within a closed beta so that we can control the size of it to a degree its an interesting difference between a packaged goods product like our previous battlefield games in that there is no real kind of big splash release date where suddenly its available it kind of builds up over time the game will kind of sneak out and before you know it it will be a fairly big game even though were in the closed beta and were not released
6732737 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6732738 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6732739 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6732740 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6732741 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6732742 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6732743 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6732744 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6732745 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6732746 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6732747 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6732748 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6732749 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6732750 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6732751 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6732752 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6732753 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6732754 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6732755 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6732756 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6732757 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6732758 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6732759 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6732760 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6732761 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6732762 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6732763 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6732764 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream

6732767 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6732768 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6732769 martin luther king adopted a strategy that appealed across the board and across racial lines where is that today
6732770 somebodys got to walk the line in the country theyve got to walk it unapologetically and im sure johnnny cash would have been a john mccain supporter if he was still around
6732771 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so this is especially dangerous in the case of political affiliation it is unfair and presumptuous to use him to bolster any platform
6732772 three strikes and youre out if you have a particularly egregious situation we say goodbye pretty quick
6732773 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6732774 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6732775 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6732776 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6732777 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6732778 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6732779 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6732780 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6732781 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6732782 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6732783 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

6732836 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6732837 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6732838 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6732839 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6732840 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6732841 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6732842 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6732843 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6732844 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6732845 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6732846 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6732847 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6732848 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

6732867 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6732868 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos

6732885 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6732890 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6732891 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6732892 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6732893 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6732894 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6732895 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6732896 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6732897 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6732898 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6732899 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6732900 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6732901 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6732902 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6732903 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6732904 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6732905 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible

6732909 all the swimmers are talking about it and sullivan is cut up about what happened
6732910 i definitely admire him for his athletic ability and everything hes achieved
6732911 im just really glad to be in the mix with that
6732912 hes not dane cook hes got a more sophisticated everyday take on things he often comes across as a questioner of conventional wisdom but also can be kind of a crank its a fine line to walk when youre dealing with a younger person
6732913 ive never been uncomfortable with that aspect i dont feel like its beneath me to sell what i did
6732914 the phone will ring and itll be him and ill maybe not answer

6732917 michael phelps is the young jeezy of the swim world
6732918 you just gotta listen to the words and get what you can get out of it
6732919 i thought it had to be a hoax because it was all of a sudden
6732920 i tried to search online and find some more information when i discovered it was true it was very sad to hear
6732921 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6732922 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
6732923 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica

6732926 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6732927 i spotted joe quickly but he was trying to hide from the crowds by tucking in between a few people
6732928 he was wearing a baseball cap and real casual dress so he wouldnt stand out
6732929 he watched only her performance then walked backstage to the meet and greet area
6732930 but when he saw people start to recognize him he hid it was real obvious he didnt want people to know he was there to see taylor
6732931 hes an amazing guy and anybody would be lucky to be dating him
6732932 shes a great girl i think anybody would love to go on a date with her
6732933 they are friends and shes friends with all the jonas brothers
6732934 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6732935 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6732936 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6732937 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6732938 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6732939 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6732940 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6732941 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6732942 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6732943 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6732944 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6732945 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6732946 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6732947 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6732948 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6732949 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6732950 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre

6732952 now that you mention it theres definitely less people i think
6732953 were still getting good crowds but you can tell its down a little bit
6732954 basically what it boils down to is people want to see how theyre going to be with aaron rodgers before they purchase tickets
6732955 im used to redskins training camp where maybe you have a hundred people at practice this is still a pretty good setup

6732968 we also obtained a favorable ruling from the irish courts relative to our proposed capital reduction and successfully negotiated the flexibility desired from our lenders to enable us to continue to execute our share repurchase program as a result we anticipate using our cash for the remainder of this fiscal year to reduce debt and continue to execute our share repurchase program

6733055 en los ltimos a os se ha producido un verdadero desfase entre la oferta de plazas mir y el n mero de licenciados en medicina ya que por ejemplo en 2007 se ofertaron 6 661 plazas mir y s lo se licenciaron 3 841 m dicos por lo que hubo un 42 34 por ciento m s de plazas de m dicos internos residentes que de licenciados
6733056 el 52 por ciento de los m dicos especialistas de la comunitat valenciana tiene m s de 50 a os
6733057 en pocos a os va a haber un notable n mero de jubilaciones que precisar n m s nuevos licenciados en medicina

6733072 mr gadd says his trial in vietnam was a charade and a travesty of justice he never got a fair trial
6733073 this morning was an opportunity for him to come before an english court and english justice for the first time and make these points
6733074 unfortunately the court did not agree to my submission that the court should hear about the unfairness of his treatment at the hands of the vietnamese justice system
6733075 mr gadd wants through me to say to you that he did not commit the offences of which he was convicted in vietnam it was a show trial and he had no opportunity to put his case forward

6733131 i have already fulfilled my obligation as a muslim by filing a complaint against the false accuser in the shariah court ibrahim said in an interview on the sidelines of a hectic campaign schedule that starts at six a m with a walkabout at the morning market and ends well past midnight
6733132 they are using dirty tactics race and making false accusations to win over the malays
6733133 this by election has yet to deliver the quality of campaigning that can generate confident optimism in malaysias future
6733134 the barisan nasional campaign is focused on anwars character and systematically used character assassination as a means to reduce anwars majority
6733135 studies show that this sort of attack serves to consolidate a partys core traditional supporters and rarely sways undecided voters
6733136 does change mean a society that puts the constitution over shariah or does it mean just less corruption more accountability

6733139 error indeed is never set forth in its naked deformity lest being thus exposed it should at once be detected but it is craftily decked out in on attractive dress so as by its outward form to make it appear to the inexperienced ridiculous as the expression may seem more true than truth itself
6733140 but even though we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to that which we have preached to you let him be accursed 9 as we have said before so i say again now if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to that which you received let him be accursed

6733155 there were a number of passengers on the number 30 bus which may have passed the scene during the time of the attack in addition to taxis and other people who were using this busy road between 10pm and 10 30pm that night
6733156 we are asking these people to cast their minds back and let us know if they saw anything suspicious
6733157 did you see a young woman walking alone or anyone acting strangely in the area if so please come forward and let us know as even the smallest piece of information can help us catch this offender
6733158 we have released a full length e fit of the offender along with an image of trainers similar to the ones he was wearing during the attack in a bid to jog peoples memory and encourage more witnesses to come forward
6733159 i would like to thank those of you who have already provided us with useful information but appeal to others who have not yet come forward to do so now someone out there saw something that night someone knows who this man is and we need you to contact us if anyone has information on either of these incidents please let us know either direct on 0845 3300247 or anonymously through crimestoppers on 0800 555111
6733160 in addition to the dedicated team of over thirty detectives we have increased high visibility police patrols around workington to reassure the community and provide a visible presence
6733161 it is extremely rare for two incidents of this nature to occur just over a mile apart in an area such as workington and we are devoting significant resources to catching those responsible for these attacks

6733170 every year since 1989 in about 25 percent of the sexual assault cases referred to the fbi where results could be obtained the primary suspect has been excluded by forensic dna testing
6733171 these percentages have remained constant for 7 years and the national institute of justices informal survey of private laboratories reveals a strikingly similar 26 percent exclusion rate
6733172 police should use a double blind photo identification procedure where someone other than the investigator who does not know who the suspect is constructs photo arrays with non suspects as fillers to reduce suggestiveness

6733238 thirty seven percent of the colleges fleet runs on some form of renewable energy including biodiesel
6733239 using the butter sculpture is a unique way to fuel the esf fleet
6733240 this separates out the triglycerides which will be split in our reactor at esf a process known as transesterification that creates the biodiesel
6733241 dairy farmers are the original environmentalists recycling nutrients and water on their land so it makes sense that this annual tribute to them is itself finding new life in fuel rather than being discarded
6733242 this is a fitting way to mark the sculptures 40th anniversary
6733243 as onondaga countys local recycling agency ocrra is thrilled with this innovative project

6733252 although yeast can derive energy from a lot of different carbon sources such as fatty acids and different kinds of sugars yeast really really like glucose the sugar found in honey
6733253 thats what they will use if its there even if its there only in trace amounts
6733254 how do you get yeast to give up their habit of using only glucose no matter what else is around
6733255 yeast essentially care about glucose because they are genetically programmed that way not because there is any physiological reason they have to care about glucose
6733256 we can genetically change that program we are using genetics to modify yeast strains so that they will use other sugars just as well as glucose

6733258 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011
6733259 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6733260 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6733261 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6733262 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed

6733265 right now the challenge for photovoltaics is to make the technology less expensive
6733266 therefore the objective is find new materials and novel device structures for cost effective photovoltaic devices
6733267 the beauty of organic photovoltaics and organic leds is low cost and flexibility
6733268 these devices can be fabricated by inexpensive solution based processing techniques similar to painting or printing
6733269 the ease of production brings costs down while the mechanical flexibility of the materials opens up a wide range of applications
6733270 the research at sdsu is focused on new materials with variable band gaps
6733271 the band gap determines how much solar energy the photovoltaic device can absorb and convert into electricity
6733272 were working on synthesizing novel polymers with variable band gaps including high medium and low band gap varieties to absorb the full spectrum of sunlight by this we can double the light harvesting or absorption
6733273 we are working to develop these new light emitting and efficient charge transporting materials to improve the light emitting efficiency of full color displays

6733340 islamic authorities in the nigerian city of bauchi have carried out the arrest of sex workers identified by the red cross in a census
6733341 the red cross carried out the census amid efforts to tackle the spread of hiv in the north eastern state
6733342 but after it had found 320 women the local sharia commission ordered that they be rounded up
6733343 the sharia commission normally liaises with the police but this time they acted directly using their own security force to arrest the sex workers
6733344 it is not clear how many of the women have already been arrested
6733345 following the arrests the red cross has halted its census
6733346 between 75 and 100 of the 320 women have so far tested positive for hiv

6733359 we are hopeful for the day that we will be able to resume military cooperation with the russians hopeful for the day that were able to resume what i would call normal cooperation with the russians right now the russians are making some decisions that are not in line with a commitment to become a part of a europe whole free and at peace

6733363 ich hoffe dass bartensteins nunmehrige betriebsamkeit ernst gemeint ist und nicht blo es wahlkampfgepl nkel des wirtschaftsministers darstellt die hohe inflation ist ein ernsthaftes problem das nicht zum spielball von wahlkampfinteressen verkommen darf
6733364 i felt pretty scared when he grabbed me but i wanted to protect my sister
6733365 i thought ive got to protect my sister then i thought oh god what should i do
6733366 my mum told me to scream if something like this happens so thats what i did but i was very scared
6733367 she was out on a bike ride with her sister when it happened at 3 30pm they were riding down towards the wokingham canoe club not far from our home
6733368 the bloke who assaulted her was in front of them he stopped his bike and let them go past
6733369 the girls then decided to turn round and go home but the man grabbed her bike he said whats your name
6733370 then he asked her what her number is but she said she did not have one he grabbed her chest and told her to come into the woods
6733371 the girls did go out a lot on their own but wont anymore
6733372 luckily my younger daughter whos still at primary school was behind her sister so did not see what happened but she said she was scared and wanted to punch the man hurting her sister but was scared he would hurt her
6733373 its heartbreaking this happened to my daughter while i sat at home
6733374 after she got home she was crying she said she had been attacked i called the police straight away and they were fantastic arriving in half an hour
6733375 she is a very brave little girl i am so proud of her
6733376 this was a very serious and frightening incident for these two young girls and i would like to talk to anyone who was in the area and may have witnessed the incident or who saw the man in the area before or after the incident in particular i would like to speak to the woman who intervened and possibly prevented the situation from getting worse
6733377 noch nie erhob der rechnungshof derartig schwere vorw rfe gegen ber einem minister die kritik des rechungshofes best tigt s mtliche vorw rfe der fp die seit dem abschluss des uns glichen deals mit der eurofighter gmbh erhoben wurden das unverantwortliche vorgehen von minister darabos disqualifiziert ihn f r jegliche minister mter da darabos handeln von der gesamten sp spitze darunter auch von faymann abgesegnet wurde tr gt die sp die verantwortung f r diese steuergeldvernichtung zu lasten der sicherheit sterreichs
6733378 jetzt wo der endbericht vorliegt wird klar warum darabos eine desinformationskampagne rund um die eurofighter gef hrt hat parlamentarische anfragen wurden ungen gend beantwortet dem parlament wurde der rohbericht vorenthalten und den medien wurden teile des rohberichts zugespielt welche darabos genehm waren w hrend der rechungshof mit unseri sen berechungen hingehalten wurde die sp hat s mtliche glaubw rdigkeit in bezug auf sicherheitspolitik transparenz und parlamentarischer kontrolle verloren
6733379 die liste der nun belegten verfehlungen von darabos ist lang kurzfristig wurden lediglich 267 millionen euro eingespart und nicht wie zuvor behauptet 370 millionen euro dass einerseits auf eine p nale der eurofighter gmbh verzichtet wurde und andererseits f r 57 millionen euro stornokosten keine nachvollziehbare darstellung vorliegt beweist einmal mehr wie sehr sich darabos von der eurofighter gmbh ber den tisch hat ziehen lassen der st ckpreis erh hte sich von 109 millionen euro auf 114 millionen euro und dies bei verzicht auf die moderne tranche 2 und teilweise gebrauchten flugzeugen beim betrieb kommt es zu schwierigkeiten aufgrund des austauschs von ersatz und umlaufteilen zwischen der tranche 2 und tranche 1 aufgrund der abbestellung von ger ten zur identifizierung bei schlechter sicht und bei nacht muss nun neues ger t nachbeschafft werden obwohl darabos ffentlich behauptete dieses ger t sei nur f r kampfeins tze die eurofighter gmbh muss die 250 millionen euro erst im september 2008 oder im m rz 2009 an die republik berweisen dies bedeutet f r den steuerzahler einen verlust von 14 bzw 20 millionen euro an zinsen mit den 57 millionen euro stornokosten macht dies nun belegte 77 millionen euro vernichtetes steuergeld s mtliche entscheidungen beruhten offensichtlich nicht auf milit rischen erw gungen sondern nur auf dem kurzsichtigen ziel die st ckzahl zu reduzieren um das gesicht nicht zu verlieren alle planungen wurden an die st ckzahl angepasst und nicht umgekehrt aber was jetzt bleibt ist das chaos welches ein zivildiener gemeinsam mit seinen roten politoffizieren angerichtet hat noch hat ein minister derartig leichtfertig aus parteipolitischen gr nden millionen euro der steuerzahler vernichtet und die milit rische sicherheit gef hrdet
6733380 langfristig werden die einsparungen von darabos aufgefressen da in den n chsten jahren aufr stungen und nachbeschaffungen zur sicherung des luftraums mit dem system eurofighter notwendig werden die fp fordert eine parlamentarische untersuchung zur endg ltigen kl rung der beispiellosen steuergeldvernichtung durch darabos entweder im rahmen eines untersuchungsausschusses oder eines unterausschusses im rechungshofausschuss die vp muss nun beweisen wie sehr ihr an der restlosen aufkl rung der causa eurofighter gelegen ist an deren letztem kapitel dem darabos deal auch sie immer interesse gezeigt hat
6733381 wie dem diesbez glichen rechnungshof bericht zu entnehmen ist hat sich verteidigungsminister darabos eine in der geschichte der zweiten republik beispiellose missachtung der parlamentarischen demokratie geleistet
6733382 mit dem beschluss des nationalrats vom 30 oktober 2006 einen untersuchungsausschuss ber die beschaffung von kampfflugzeugen einzusetzen ist ein klarer auftrag an den minister verbunden
6733383 dass alle schritte zu setzen sind um den kaufvertrag kosteng nstig aufzul sen und den beschaffungsvorgang so lange zu unterbrechen bis der bericht des untersuchungsausschusses vorliegt aus einem schreiben des verteidigungsministeriums das die detailvereinbarung des von minister darabos im alleingang ausgehandelten vergleiches zum inhalt hat wird genau dieser auftrag des nationalrats eigenm chtig aufgehoben
6733384 die wirksamkeit des vergleiches sollte unabh ngig vom ergebnis des parlamentarischen untersuchungsausschusses ber die beschaffung von kampfflugzeugen dessen abschluss ende juni 2007 erwartet wurde gelten
6733385 das hei t unzweideutig dass minister darabos in eigenm chtiger ausweitung seiner kompetenzen den auftrag des sterreichischen nationalrats f r nichtig erkl rte und sich dar ber hinwegsetzte dieses vorgehen
6733386 ist eines demokraten unw rdig und hat zum sofortigen r cktritt des verteidigungsministers zu f hren f r eine weitere amtszeit als minister f r die sich darabos medial bereits beworben hat kommt der zivildiener im verteidigungsministerium damit nicht in frage
6733387 untuk menunjukkan kita partai terbuka dan agar mencapai target kita kita mengajukan caleg yang beragam ada selebriti dan ada juga kiai kiai

6733389 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6733390 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6733391 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6733392 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6733393 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6733394 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6733395 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6733396 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6733397 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6733398 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6733399 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6733400 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6733401 es gibt keine regel dass ber wichtige fragen nicht gemeinsam nachgedacht wird
6733402 wenn es sich nicht lediglich um eine bildungspolitische showreise handeln soll
6733403 would love to get to work on whats been discussed and will give an update at the end of the day
6733404 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6733405 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6733406 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6733407 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6733408 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6733409 hey andy want to play some concerts in south america with your band and then do a set of danger danger tunes with ted
6733410 i am very excited to be playing with andy again for this special tour and especially to see his own band in action just to watch him play up close is such a privilege its like watching a miracle in progress and when we combine forces onstage to play the classics i am going to have the best seat in the house i have been dreaming about this reunion for over 15 years
6733411 we would love to come to brazil someday soon as danger danger but we are busy locked up in the studio completing the new d2 cd
6733412 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6733413 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6733414 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6733415 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6733416 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6733417 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6733418 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6733419 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6733420 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6733421 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6733422 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6733423 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6733424 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6733425 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6733426 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6733427 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6733428 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6733429 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6733430 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6733431 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6733432 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6733433 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6733434 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6733435 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6733436 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6733437 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6733438 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6733439 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6733440 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6733441 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6733442 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6733443 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6733444 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6733445 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6733446 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6733447 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6733448 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6733449 its up to us we have to start stringing together some wins we cant win one here and then lose one we have to get on a streak
6733450 we have large member now they are satisfied with our product
6733451 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6733452 this is a planning took where all things are going
6733453 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6733454 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6733455 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6733456 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6733457 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6733458 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6733459 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6733460 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6733461 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6733462 ich schlie e mich dem aufruf der initiatoren zeigt zivilcourage und engagement bringt euch mit ideen und projekten ein zeigen wir der braunen meute dass hier kein platz f r sie ist
6733463 tragen sie mit ihrer anwesenheit am samstag dazu bei dass auch hier in der alten neustadt in dem fast 800 jahre alten stadtteil im herzen von magdeburg der mob keine chance hat sorgen sie mit daf r dass sie ihre kinder nachbarn alte und junge hier weiter gern leben im sinne einer sympathischen weltoffenen lebens und liebenswerten stadt
6733464 diese leute lehnen unsere freiheitlich demokratische grundordnung als basis unseres zusammenlebens und damit auch jene toleranz ab die sie selbst f r sich so nachdr cklich einfordern
6733465 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6733466 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6733467 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6733468 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6733469 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6733470 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6733471 als mitglied des europ ischen rates der historischen museen nimmt das haus der geschichte am kooperationsprogramm euroclio teil
6733472 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6733473 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6733474 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6733475 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6733476 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

6733486 noch sind die spekulationsverluste bei den bb nicht einmal ansatzweise verdaut schon kommt bei der asfinag der n chste zocker skandal im verantwortungsbereich von werner faymann ans tageslicht nach stand anfang 2008 wurden laut rechnungshof 113 mio euro ohne jede finanzielle oder bilanztechnische notwendigkeit f r w hrungsswap gesch fte vergeigt begonnen unter einem vorstand dem bm faymann dann 2007 ohne not weit ber 2 mio euro an abfertigung verschaffte
6733487 will faymann dazu auch wieder nur l cheln und alles herunterspielen wie bei den bb das wird den autofahrerinnen und autofahrern deren geld hier verzockt wird ebensowenig schmecken wie den steuerzahlerinnen die am ende des tages f r den schuldenberg und die spekulationsverluste der asfinag gerade stehen m ssen
6733488 zuschauen und l cheln ist keine verkehrspolitik faymann muss endlich seine verantwortung ernstnehmen statt in seinem zust ndigkeitsbereich weiterhin die z gel wie in den letzten beiden jahren schleifen zu lassen
6733489 mehr geld f r bessere ffis w re kein problem stattdessen wird das geld verspekuliert
6733490 10 mrd schulden derzeit und 20 mrd oder mehr im jahr 2020 sind keine perspektive
6733491 faymann hat nur bauprogramme ohne konzept vorgelegt und sich in der sonne der gro en milliardenbetr ge ger kelt spekulationsskandale wie bei bb und asfinag sind aber ein untr gliches zeichen dass viel zuviel geld im system ist und zugleich zu wenig aufsicht des zust ndigen ministers aufwachen herr faymann

6733573 well one day this little girl erica a very bright very outgoing kid takes her turn and waddles up to the front of the class with a pillow stuffed under her sweater
6733574 shes standing there with her hands on the pillow and im trying not to laugh and wishing i had my camcorder with me the kids are watching her in amazement
6733575 now this kid is doing a hysterical duck walk and groaning
6733576 erica has her legs spread with her little hands miming water flowing away it was too much
6733577 then erica stood up took a big theatrical bow and returned to her seat im sure i applauded the loudest ever since then when its show and tell day i bring my camcorder just in case another middle wife comes along

6733601 part 1 of this two part series examines some of the mobile devices that are optimized for enterprise applications part 2 explores what else is out there
6733602 the reason for my ranking is that blackberry had much success with creating a device for extended e mail to mobile devices and as a result of organizations rolling out e mail as the first real enterprise app businesses wanted to leverage their hardware investment and broaden the blackberry devices extensibility as well as minimize management for multiple devices
6733603 its browser interface is very strong the cost of the solution has grown more favorable but us 400 for the initial device compared to blackberry devices was a huge impediment its new price should be more favorable for greater adoption within the enterprise but i believe apple lost some potential customers due to its initial high costs of procurement the result buyers turned to blackberries
6733604 drastically impeded penetration as sales resources that had iphones for personal use couldnt consolidate tasks to one device
6733605 they still had to use their blackberries so until recently apples iphone faced a major hurdle as resources who wanted to port over their iphone to support business activities had to depend on two devices to handle calls and e mails now though the product supports exchange so its possible iphone will gain some traction but apple isnt known for running enterprise business applications well see how that changes
6733606 the blackberry devices are just a few of many devices that support business mobile apps sprint has a wide range of solutions that can address our customers needs regardless of the device they are carrying most smartphones can support a variety of business mobile apps and most devices are compatible with gps based business applications including several rugged devices that are well suited for tough business environments
6733607 most of the solutions that have been successful outside of e mail are the more blue collar industry solutions like those focused on fleet management and field services
6733608 we started with the fact that most vendors approach was to bring in a mobile front end and build synchronization between the device and enterprise platforms
6733609 the problem with those approaches one is that from a user perspective its rather painful to learn how the mobile crm app works on their device usually a different navigation paradigm was involved and then you had to remember to keep things synchronized from an application management perspective its also quite painful it has to manage another version of the application for each device for many different models with unique features so the cost of administration for it managers isnt trivial its pretty significant
6733610 we realized the limitations of this approach and in 2004 when our partnership with rim began we sat down with them and said hey blackberry is now the de facto platform for mobile enterprise users
6733611 we leveraged the capabilities of rims push and synchronization technology so that data and communications automatically gets pushed to the user similar to the solution they came up with e mail synchronization
6733612 unlike other mobile device manufacturers who access enterprise data through their mobile internet networks blackberry has taken the approach of installing blackberry enterprise servers within firewalls that gives them access to internal enterprise systems
6733613 were looking at report and analysis distribution features as well as workforce management theres a lot of ideas in the works but we plan on tackling the most common problems first theyll be a natural extension of native capabilities on the device and well just add on more features and capabilities over time
6733614 the sixties were really good to me a large part of those years are now just a gentle wind blowing in the cavities of my mind

6733669 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation

6733685 those tiny mysterious interactions between the actor and the scene that make up the memorable moments in any good film
6733686 such tingling moments liberate the imagination of both actors and audiences they are simply curiosity flexing itself spoofing making connections to a new situation

6733688 not so long ago the movies whatever their simplifications and distortions still rested on the assumption that their function was to present some intelligible structured image of reality on the simplest level to tell a story and to entertain but more generally to extend the spectators meaningful experience to offer him a window on the real world
6733689 what are they now icebergs of a sort they take things that dont belong together charge them up with hidden meanings and then unite them in a juxtaposition that is bound to shock the spectator into a lubricated state of mind where he is forced to think seriously about the phony implications of what he is seeing
6733690 his legacy includes a school of estranged clown fish intellectual ineffectuals a vivid communication of mucking about a good eye for damp villas in the suburbs an ability to turn any actress into a doll part of the decor some great still shots that have an irascible energy an endless supply of lists
6733691 i think that i shall never see scenes with more sleep provoking powers or hear so many big words that tell me nothing or be an audience to film writing which gets to the heart of an idea and hangs in there or be so edified by the sound and sight of decent noble words spoken with utter piety

6733714 en verano era t pico la demanda de viviendas de turismo rural para 15 d as ahora se ha reducido en una semana tambi n es verdad que como est la expo prefieren pasar una semana en la pirineo y dos o tres d as en la expo
6733715 en meses que eran temporada baja o media para huesca gracias a la expo hay hoteles que est n llenos
6733716 de los cuatro y cuatro millones y medio de visitantes que espera recibir la exp un 20 o un 15 deciden quedarse alg n d a m s y visitar otras zonas de arag n personas que otros a os no hubieran venido a arag n para nada

6733720 when will silicon run out of gas can it fuel this exponential growth for 40 years to come
6733721 we got very close to the limit at 45 nanometers we were able to innovate our way out of what seemed an unsolvable problem weve got some challenges ahead of us it looks like 32 nanometers is on track but you go beyond that and it looks a little bit iffy
6733722 we think cmos will continue to be the workhorse for many years in the future
6733723 its like being back in the 1940s trying to invent the new transistor

6733734 could have been a walk to the next town or an hours ride in the car or an overnight plane trip
6733735 the emphasis on industrial policies risks preserving the apartheid era pattern of protected national champions insulated from foreign competition and enjoying high mark ups this runs counter to the acknowledged need to enhance the level of competition in the economy also the emphasis on government programmes and initiatives is at odds with the recognition of failures of government planning coordination and administrative capacity as one of the constraints to achieving faster and more widely shared growth
6733736 brought the ever secretive mr silver out to meet voters and campaign for his job
6733737 congruent with huffposts editorial position against the medias penchant for viewing everything through a left right prism
6733738 we are grateful for atienzas positive response to our demand he has not only upheld the rights of landless farmers to utilize and have access to and utilize production forest lands he also upheld the law against violators
6733739 which is in excess of the 20 hectares allowed for food production
6733740 this is a breakthrough for a group of landless but organized farmers to get a favorable decision from the denr on the cancellation of violated pasture lease agreements holders of flglas in bukidnon are very powerful and politically entrenched that many of us farmers who merely work for them are scared
6733741 the cancellation of these pasture leases signifies that the poor farmers and indigenous peoples who are deprived of land to till have hope to uplift their lives if only government is sincere in implementing laws and programmes and will not lift a finger in punishing erring forest land lease holders
6733742 we have bigger operations now in terms of assets and area covered than in abubakar in 2000
6733743 we deemed it smarter this time not to give them space to breathe we were a bit soft at first assuming that it will not escalate we are ready for any escalation of action
6733744 the results are good based on reports of our ground troops they are happy that weve had direct hits we want them to render an official report to document our air strike missions to see if thats true this is to review and improve on our doctrines and procedures
6733745 back in may just before teched north america we released a preview version of our new social bookmarking app for msdn for technet and for expression since then thousands of technical professionals from around the world have begun using it to save their web favorites online share them with others see what other technical pros are favoriting and connect with others im happy to say that in early september we plan on releasing a full version of the app v 1 0

6733747 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011
6733748 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6733749 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6733750 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6733751 the number of us military bases would depend on the size and the needs of the troops
6733752 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
6733753 the us has gone very far in this agreement it is a very advanced agreement
6733754 its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification or anything like that

6733759 recently some special interest groups have claimed without providing any scientific rationale that some methods of contraception may have an abortifacient effect
6733760 no direct evidence exists showing that implantation is prevented by progestin only methods
6733761 the evidence does not support the theory that the usual mechanism of action of iuds is destruction of fertilized ova in the uterus
6733762 even though the precise mechanism of action of modern contraceptive is not yet fully known scientific evidence suggests the main mechanisms of action for each method inhibition of ovulation and effects on the cervical mucus are the primary mechanisms of the contraceptive action of hormonal methods evidence indicates that the primary mechanism of action of iuds is the prevention of fertilization
6733763 all of these methods directly or indirectly have effects on the endometrium the lining of the uterus that might prevent implantation of a fertilized ovum
6733764 so far no scientific evidence has been published supporting this possibility
6733765 insufficient evidence exists on whether cellular or biological changes in the endometrium could actually prevent implantation
6733766 the possibility of fertilization during combined oral contraceptive use is very small hence endometrial changes are unlikely to play an important role if any in the observed contraceptive effectiveness of combined oral contraceptives
6733767 currently the claim that hormonal contraceptives birth control pills implants norplant injectables depoprovera include an abortifacient mechanism of action is being widely disseminated in the pro life community
6733768 the presumption that implantation of a blastocyst is thwarted by
6733769 the hormonal contraception is abortifacient theory is not established scientific fact it is speculation and the discussion presented here suggests it is error
6733770 if a family weighing all the factors affecting their own circumstances decides to use this modality we are confident that they are not using an abortifacient

6733772 tottenham fans are no exception to any others they support the team and get behind the side
6733773 if a player is on form if he knocks in a couple of goals then im sure anyone who booed him last week will soon be getting behind him and cheering him that is what it is like
6733774 while he is still here he is very much 100 a tottenham player that is how we consider things
6733775 it is not a case of finding a solution to a problem before it occurs
6733776 weve got a list of targets that we are working very hard on
6733777 negotiations are tough and sometimes they are even tougher than usual we know what we are working towards and we know what our objectives are
6733778 the process of signing players sometimes takes time but fans should be aware we are trying to strengthen up front and sign a new forward quite often these things take time
6733779 whether its a different group of pirates we cant tell until an investigation is carried out we have sent out an urgent warning to all ships travelling through the gulf of aden
6733780 we want to pressure the united nations and the international community to do something about it to take steps to stop this menace
6733781 without un intervention we cant do anything because somalia has no central government
6733782 all i know is that the case against the shipowner continues
6733783 from the direction of gori three armored vehicles are moving in our direction plus two trucks loaded with personnel and they passed us and went in the direction of igoeti i asked one of the russian officers at the checkpoint who was wearing a peacekeeping armband and he said they dont intend to stay for long when i asked him to be more concrete he said we are waiting for orders i cant tell you anything my boss is general borisov
6733784 yesterday august 21 general borisov had a fairly heated discussion with gori regional governor vladimer vardzelashvili about the so called buffer zone
6733785 borisov had all kinds of maps out and was referring to the 1992 cease fire agreement which stipulates that the conflict zone included quite a lot of villages north of gori in gori district including two villages that are located along the main east west highway shavshvebi and agara so if we go with that agreement it would mean that the so called peacekeepers who would replace the regular russian troops will have the right to control the main highway and even establish checkpoints
6733786 the idea is by tomorrow night august 22 all those forces will move to within that perimeter the peacekeeping perimeter
6733787 i have to say from witnessing all the discussions going on about the issue i have the feeling that neither side has a good understanding of how to proceed
6733788 for instance yesterday when vardzelashvili tried to make the argument that the main highway of a sovereign country cannot be controlled by troops from another country borisov tried to calm him down by saying the troops wont actually stand on the highway or hinder traffic that theyd just stand off to the side i managed somehow to have a look at the maps and its clearly marked at shavshvebi and agara that the buffer zone crosses the highway so this is what they have on their maps
6733789 we believe the six principles are clear and already implemented
6733790 some were asking in consultation today why there is no reference to territorial integrity on our draft resolution our draft resolution again is a repetition a reconfirmation of the six principles
6733791 and you know what there is no territorial integrity in the six principles so if we stick to the six principles which were adopted by the two presidents there is not supposed to be any reference in the resolution to territorial integrity

6733839 plans to vote for barr for president and said he believes barrs reversal on doma is sincere

6733857 in spite of this pioneering and continuing role islam as a cultural force in hip hop is severely under documented
6733858 we had a great opening week and wins breed confidence said the rotherham manager
6733859 i want people to be confident but not complacent and we have got to make sure we guard against that
6733860 as soon as we start to think were are great players because weve won one or two then we will come unstuck you cannot rest on your laurels because we all know how quickly things can turn around in football
6733861 weve continued playing the sort of football that brought us a lot of success last year and were not going to change our style said waddock
6733862 im happy with the squad weve got theres good competition for places and if we carry on playing that way then i think well pick up results on the way
6733863 i dont think there are many teams that will go to exeter and take all three points especially if they play the way they did with the spirit and the passing they have got it was a big result because it now means we have played two league games and won both
6733864 bradford are worthy favourites to go up and if you dont see them as that there is something wrong with you said hill
6733865 on the pitch over 90 minutes we will be more than competitive and that is what we want to be and expect to be bradford city are a very good team who have started the season extremely well but so have we
6733866 of course its nice to get off to a good start but unless you build on that it means nothing its a much better start than last season and for the confidence side of things its good but we wont get carried away with it
6733867 all of the coaching staff here were part of the team when we first came down from the premier league in 2001 we started then with three wins but we all know how that season ended up
6733868 we have made a few bids for him and joe is a player we have tracked for a long time it would be interesting to see how many goals he could get with a team that is hopefully in the top half of the table
6733869 when you start off with two games and do not get a point you are going to be under pressure
6733870 the players have to have the nerve and the bottle to deal with it
6733871 it is a testing time for everyone within the club and the only way we will put it right is with hard work we should have got something on the board by now but they are all big games now
6733872 theyre a side who were relegated a big club with a beautiful stadium said moore referring to leicester
6733873 thats got to be a buzz for the players to go and play there and not only that to go and show how good we are
6733874 its a definite lift for players who dont normally play at stadiums like that but its not the stadium its the team that wins you games
6733875 we are going to be a target for people this season no doubt about that and we have certainly risen to the challenge pretty well
6733876 we have had a decent start but it is far too early to form any opinions about who is going to be up among the leaders towards the end of the season
6733877 i think teams look at us anyway they know we arent a pushover and are as good as any team on our day
6733878 there are lots of teams and managers probably thinking the same as we are if we get consistency into our game weve got as good a chance as anyone of getting out of this division
6733879 weve got a situation at this football club where people write us off and put us down as relegation fodder but its important the players realise they belong in this league and make sure we set high standards
6733880 im trying to get longer term signings if i can and i asked dean if he would come to us for six months
6733881 he is only prepared to do a month at present because he wants to get into the squad at charlton this season but well continue to look at it
6733882 i would expect something to happen before the transfer window closes said doyle
6733883 these are two really big games coming up if we can get the right result against bristol city it really sets it up nicely for the newcastle match
6733884 we had to strengthen our squad over the summer and it has showed in the way weve started you cant do any better than two wins out of two
6733885 weve played the same team and done well so far but i dont have a problem in changing things if the occasion warrants it rangers have a mix of players
6733886 theyve added some italian and spanish players but they are also very strong in certain areas and we have to be aware of that i have never been fixated on our opponents but you have to take everything into account when you prepare for games

6733888 some of the reasons they won had to do with location but also a contributing factor was that visitors coming on the page can also control the camera
6733889 add the fact that the feed is free to view and you can see why it is our top choice for the san diego area
6733890 our surf members love this camera and view it all the time even if they are not in san diego
6733891 last year we had to go out and redo some of the wiring but the camera is running better than ever and becoming very popular for not just surfers but people from around the world
6733892 we are lucky to have some great sponsors including bobs mission surf and dr
6733893 our monthly cost to run this camera is over 500 00 per month which includes pier rent internet cable and wireless transmission charges
6733894 in addition we have to run maintenance to replace and clean wiring and equipment
6733895 we are always looking for new sponsors and people who wish to buy the feed

6733958 there is now a two year period of consultation and review before any of the proposals are implemented this will leave just ten years for the uk to establish a renewables infrastructure strong enough to meet its 2020 target
6733959 the uk is possibly being overly dependent upon its ability to translate ambitious targets into reality and needs to concentrate and improve its delivery track record if its position is not to decline further
6733960 strong contrast to the speed at which germany has addressed the challenges placed by the eu renewables directive
6733961 on the whole the credit crunch has not impacted upon the attractiveness of the sector
6733962 to make the uk a world leader in attracting investment in this sector and to avoid it slipping further down the index the government needs to consider creating tangible incentives for investors following the lead of germany and the ambition of china
6733963 the uk is still an attractive place to invest and renewables are a good long term investment a ten fold increase in renewable energy will bring on around 160 000 jobs and an estimated 100bn of investment from the private sector

6733993 every coach has his particular style and we are playing the way the coach wants us to play but the breakdowns have been a big problem
6733994 we run into gaps and we have shown that we have the capability to score tries but i feel that if we are going to win matches then we are going to have to commit players to the breakdown a lot more than we are at present
6733995 we have lost important possession at crucial stages of the past few games and it has cost us

6734000 even though obama is not going to commit there i still think a lot of black people are going to turn out so they can tell their grandchildren that they voted for barack obama

6734002 open dag zaterdag 21 juni 2008 van 11 00 15 00 uur
6734003 i got over the wanting to be cool thing a long time ago and found it quite liberating once you stop worrying about how you might be perceived even in character its strangely freeing
6734004 so ive actually gravitated towards doing things that are uncomfortable and embarrassing and i enjoy it
6734005 they have about eight players who are 62 plus so that makes them big
6734006 i think that if youre big you cant not get away with being physical you cant have a 62 namby pamby it would be pointless in football they are big and they are physical and that leads to people saying that they will be crash bang wallop and iain dowie has never been that type of player or that type of manager or coach and i think that is a bit harsh if that is the kind of take they get
6734007 theyve got one or two skillful players and a couple of foreigners that they have brought in and its a case of merging the two you need the physical strength in the english league but you also need guile qpr on paper look to be a well balanced side
6734008 it was good to see them in action and obviously the likes of rowly and hogan are in my thoughts ahead of the doncaster game
6734009 from the moment we conceded our first goal it was an uphill task
6734010 of course its disappointing we planned all week long and within a couple of minutes we were behind
6734011 goals change games and they came out the blocks really well and we did the complete opposite
6734012 weve only got ourselves to blame but football being football weve got the chance to put the wrongs of that display to right against doncaster
6734013 without any shadow of doubt we need to bounce back
6734014 we let ourselves and our fans down on saturday so now is the time to respond
6734015 it is getting better every day and things are looking good now
6734016 it has been very frustrating because after getting through pre season i thought i might have turned a corner
6734017 i am still confident but half of the time i feel like a broken down car i never know if i am going to start in the morning or not
6734018 some of my friends say i am cursed but i dont believe that
6734019 it has just been rotten luck and i am just hoping that is about to go away for good
6734020 there is nothing you can do about injuries when you play the game fully committed then there is a chance you are going to get hurt
6734021 there is always a bit of a hangover period after you suffer a relegation
6734022 one or two players think that they wont have to do too much to win promotion at the first attempt but that is easier said than done
6734023 it is difficult to get the consistency and there are a lot of subconscious negatives because of relegation the season before
6734024 they have experienced championship players and they look as though they want to play football in the right way
6734025 who will be the new vice president whoever you want thats who

6734039 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
6734040 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6734041 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6734042 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6734043 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6734044 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is
6734045 there arent too many authors of note who have passed through l a in the last three decades whom connie hasnt interviewed and interviewed well
6734046 this inherently transdisciplinary archive will provide material for research projects for generations of scholars and students
6734047 digitizing these tapes will give students and others an opportunity to hear and watch these outstanding authors for themselves whenever they want
6734048 seeing authors up close like this provides a rich point of view to their work
6734049 drucker believed that a healthy society is run by organizations whose values are shaped by a wide range of disciplines history sociology psychology culture and religion
6734050 in fact drucker once described management books as dreadful trash and suggested that he derived much of his philosophy from novelists such as austen balzac and others
6734051 is a beautiful setting for the tapes to call home

6734054 die aufschl ge der mobilfunknetzbetreiber sind exorbitant ohne dass die inhalteanbieter die auch das gesch ftliche risiko tragen daran partizipieren w rden
6734055 w hrend im festnetz ein einheitlicher preis f r alle verbraucher gilt k nnen die mobilfunkanbieter den endkundenpreis f r gespr che etwa zu 118xy oder 0900 nach freiem ermessen bestimmen
6734056 aber das bundeskabinett zu kurz gesprungen wie kommt glos auf die 28 cent wir kommen bei wohlwollender berechnung ungef hr auf 22 cent da sind immer noch terminierungsentgelte von acht bis neun cent enthalten eu kommissarin viviane reding will in den n chsten zwei bis drei jahren diese terminierungsentgelte auf 1 2 cent reduzieren so wie sie im festnetz sind mit welcher logik nimmt ein mobilfunker ein vielfaches von dem was ein festnetzanbieter berechnen darf das kann mir keiner erkl ren
6734057 wenn die inhalteanbieter die preise bestimmen k nnten g be es die abzocker diskussion nicht
6734058 bei vielen anderen anbietern reichen schon kleinere verst e aus um rufnummern entzogen zu bekommen

6734065 the economy has changed dramatically and people just arent eating out as much anymore
6734066 people are cutting back everywhere and a lot of companies including cafe dupri are feeling the effect
6734067 for the past two months business at the cafe has been down and if the business isnt making money i feel its a smart move to shut it down bottom line if it doesnt make money it doesnt make sense

6734076 the famous painting hung in the place of honor in the salon carre and not a vestige of a clue was left by the person or persons who took it to aid the detectives and police in trying to trace it a search of every nook and cranny of the louvre from roof to cellar only brought to light the valuable frame in which the picture hung and the glass that covered it these were intact on a back staircase
6734077 some persons there are who believe that a practical joke has been played but nevertheless the government has set to work its entire force of detectives in an effort to recover the painting

6734079 mr gadd says his trial in vietnam was a charade and a travesty of justice he never got a fair trial
6734080 this morning was an opportunity for him to come before an english court and english justice for the first time and make these points
6734081 unfortunately the court did not agree to my submission that the court should hear about the unfairness of his treatment at the hands of the vietnamese justice system
6734082 mr gadd wants through me to say to you that he did not commit the offences of which he was convicted in vietnam it was a show trial and he had no opportunity to put his case forward

6734088 i think all the records that nist has assembled should be archived i would really like to see someone else take a look at what theyve done both structurally and from a fire point of view i think the official conclusion that nist arrived at is questionable
6734089 photos of the steel evidence about how the buildings collapsed the unexplainable collapse of wtc 7 evidence of thermite in the debris as well as several other red flags are quite troubling indications of well planned and controlled demolition
6734090 why would all 47 stories of wtc 7 fall straight down to the ground in about seven seconds it was not struck by any aircraft or engulfed in any fire an independent investigation is justified for all three collapses including the surviving steel samples and the composition of the dust
6734091 wtc 7 building could not have collapsed as a result of internal fire and external debris no plane hit this building this is the only case of a steel frame building collapsing through fire in the world the fire on this building was small amp localized therefore what is the cause
6734092 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6734093 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6734094 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6734095 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6734096 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees

6734099 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6734100 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6734101 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6734102 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6734103 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday

6734107 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6734108 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6734109 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests

6734111 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6734112 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6734113 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6734114 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it

6734119 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6734120 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6734121 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
6734122 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6734123 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6734124 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6734125 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6734126 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6734127 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6734128 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6734129 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6734130 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6734131 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6734132 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6734133 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6734134 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6734135 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6734136 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6734137 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6734138 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6734139 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6734140 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6734141 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6734142 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6734143 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6734144 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6734145 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6734146 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6734147 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6734148 we are very pleased to expand our partnership with kmart pharmacy
6734149 we are committed to providing our customers with industry leading support expertise and technology offerings to enable their pharmacies to focus on patient care this partnership will further expand kmarts ability to assist their patients with adherence and compliance when filling prescriptions
6734150 after a rigorous evaluation process we determined the erx network offered the best combination of technology innovation and pharmacy domain expertise we are pleased to announce the award of this contract to erx network

6734154 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6734155 if we use their tactics well lose the moral high ground
6734156 the fundamental basis of this nations laws was given to moses on the mount the fundamental basis of our bill of rights comes from the teachings we get from exodus and st matthew from isaiah and st paul
6734157 i dont think we emphasize that enough these days if we dont have a proper fundamental moral background we will finally end up with a totalitarian government which does not believe in rights for anybody except the state
6734158 a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor
6734159 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6734160 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
6734161 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
6734162 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
6734163 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6734164 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6734165 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6734166 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6734167 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6734168 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6734169 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6734170 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6734171 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6734172 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6734173 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6734174 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6734175 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6734176 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6734177 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6734178 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6734179 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6734180 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6734181 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6734182 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6734183 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6734184 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6734185 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6734186 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6734187 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6734188 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6734189 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6734190 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6734191 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6734192 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6734193 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6734194 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6734195 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6734196 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6734197 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6734198 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6734199 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything

6734208 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6734209 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6734210 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6734211 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6734212 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6734213 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6734214 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6734215 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6734216 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6734217 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6734218 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6734219 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6734220 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6734221 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6734222 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6734223 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6734224 well i can now announce that tom and i are expecting a baby and we are very happy
6734225 thank you for all your kindness good wishes and support even if it was based on speculation

6734241 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6734242 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6734243 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6734244 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6734245 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6734246 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6734247 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6734248 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6734249 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6734250 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6734251 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6734252 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6734253 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6734254 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6734255 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6734256 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6734257 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6734258 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6734259 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6734260 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6734261 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people

6734264 the united states wants officials to resume international trade talks in september
6734265 she said in an interview with specialist newsletter inside u s trade on wednesday that senior officials from a small group of countries should meet next month to explore the possibility of restarting the doha round negotiations at the world trade organisation wto
6734266 schwab was speaking ahead of a visit to washington on thursday and friday by wto director general pascal lamy who also visited india last week
6734267 schwabs comments reported in the newsletters online edition reinforce those made by several countries
6734268 that meeting saw progress on the headline areas of agricultural and industrial tariffs and subsidies
6734269 world trade organization chief pascal lamy and top us trade negotiator susan schwab were to meet in washington in an effort to restart the doha round of negotiations a us official said
6734270 lamys visit to the us capital comes on the heels of his trip to india last week to discuss the possibility of restarting the doha round after the collapse of ministerial talks in geneva over a us india impasse on agricultural protection
6734271 india said it would return to global trade talks if the us signals it believes the impasse can be overcom e
6734272 lamy the wto director general and us trade representative schwab were to have a private dinner late thursday and hold further talks friday morning ustr spokeswoman gretchen hamel told afp
6734273 in new delhi last week lamy told reporters he was leaving with a sense of indias political will to resume talks and he would conduct the same exercise in washington to gauge the political mood
6734274 i will play the role of a midwife if the negotiating parties want delivery of the baby he said
6734275 pascal lamy minding the doha round negotiations that collapsed in geneva on july 29 was in india last week and is in washington this week
6734276 a marathon runner who goes the distance in a 26 mile run mr lamy is not giving up when he is at the last mile
6734277 at the outset remember that every round has taken more to finish in recent memory than the previous one the longest to date was the uruguay round the last round of multilateral trade negotiations under the auspices of the general agreement on tariffs and trade
6734278 the central problem therefore arose from the fact that the u s offer on trade distorting subsidies was too low prompting an unacceptable indian demand for an over cautious ssm
6734279 this solution is not politically impossible it requires america to move away further from distorting subsidies and substituting them with non distorting subsidies a move that is surely possible even in a presidential election year since total farm support can be maintained while its composition changes in a pro trade direction
6734280 actually there is a glimmer that america might be able to do just this thus
6734281 the grudging nature of this statement leaves an opening especially when one remembers that some opening of developing country agricultural markets already is in the agreed agenda
6734282 the compromise while doable is above the pay grade of the trade ministers
6734283 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6734284 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6734285 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6734286 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6734287 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6734288 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6734289 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6734290 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6734291 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6734292 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6734293 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6734294 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6734295 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6734296 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6734297 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6734298 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6734299 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you

6734309 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6734310 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6734311 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6734312 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6734313 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6734314 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6734315 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6734316 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6734317 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6734318 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6734319 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6734320 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6734321 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6734322 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6734323 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6734324 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6734325 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6734326 you always find out whos been swimming naked when the tide goes out we found out that wall street has been kind of a nudist beach
6734327 what were seeing in business in our retail businesses or anything having to do with housing is even a further slowing down in june and july both in terms of credit experience where people first got in trouble with house payments and now
6734328 in my judgment it wont be any better five months from now
6734329 that doesnt mean that the equity cant get wiped out and it almost has in a practical sense as institutions they dont have any net worth people who own their insured mortgages or own their debt nothing is going to happen to them the equity and preferred stock is another question
6734330 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6734331 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6734332 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6734333 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6734334 it becomes evident that while discussing climate we are not witnessing a clash of views about the environment but a clash of views about human freedom
6734335 as someone who lived under communism for most of my life i feel obliged to say that the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity at the beginning of the 21st century is not communism or its various softer variants
6734336 why do so many people who subscribe to the belief in global warming also subscribe to the leftist liberal viewpoint on so many matters why does this belief appeal to those that have a certain political view
6734337 what does a cane toad and salt water intrusion have to do with global warming see you liberals just flip and spin flip and spin obama is an expert at it
6734338 it didnt take us long to figure out what this
6734339 if the lawyers will take the case sue the people who sell carbon credits that includes al gore that lawsuit would get so much publicity so much media attention and as the experts went to the witness stand and testified i feel like that could become the vehicle to finally put some light on the fraud of global warming
6734340 also i dont think that the republicans have handled the war on terror very well either
6734341 none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases
6734342 no study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man made causes
6734343 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6734344 quit categorizing everyone who is not a conservative republican as an athiest who has no love and respect for this nation
6734345 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6734346 btw going from the frying pan to the fire is technically
6734347 bowing to pressure from environmental groups the florida senate recently passed a bill backed by gov charlie crist that would eventually shut down six pipes that carry waste water into the atlantic from miami dade broward and palm beach counties
6734348 people are getting smart on the bs behind mmgw and that is exactly why algore is trying to recruit
6734349 no trippin we just have to stop dumping raw feces and piss into the ocean simple
6734350 i didnt know what to expect some kind of moonscape perhaps but it was incredible huge matrices of branching porites coral up to 8 meters 25 feet high had established creating a thriving coral reef habitat
6734351 throughout other parts of the lagoon it was awesome to see coral cover as high as 80 percent and large tree like branching coral formations with trunks 30 centimeters 12 inches thick

6734353 vancouver island can present some of the most challenging conditions a kayaker can face including fierce winds and huge waves off the notorious headlands of cape scott and the brooks peninsular high surf and treacherous reefs guarding the remote beaches of the west coast and raging tidal rapids reaching speeds of 15knots in the myriad of channels separating the vancouver island from the mainland
6734354 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6734355 they told me there are going to be resources here
6734356 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6734357 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6734358 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6734359 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6734360 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6734361 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6734362 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6734363 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6734364 i think he will bend over backward not to give markets much to go on just ask yourself what has happened since the last federal open market committee meeting
6734365 inflation has picked up but some of the underlying components of inflation have moderated particularly oil what can he say
6734366 hes going to have let people understand what his logic is on the trade offs between inflation and the risks of recession
6734367 he will provide an outlook and describe what weve been through in the last year
6734368 the fed remains quite concerned about growth all options are on the table
6734369 i hope we get more clarity from bernanke about the coordination between
6734370 the feds done yeomans work but there are limits to what the fed can deliver
6734371 its really weeded out the little guy thats building on a limited budget
6734372 hes not going to be able to afford to stay in the sport
6734373 i get calls every day asking about the price if they dont like mine they go down the road and call the next guy
6734374 for a while more people brought in cars but the regulations are tough
6734375 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6734376 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6734377 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6734378 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6734379 the longest ive ever lived anywhere was in the hanoy hilton
6734380 well what are you waiting for take the shot dummy
6734381 i did what i could but he was just too quick in that last round
6734382 i had to settle for bronze but what happened to jones in the final led to the whole olympic scoring system being changed
6734383 if youre a boxer you make damn sure you make the weight

6734391 if you have a quality product consistently packaged dont top dress by taking the worst and putting it on the bottom all that is the way you build your name here at the auction
6734392 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6734393 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6734394 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6734395 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6734396 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6734397 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6734398 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6734399 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6734400 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6734401 i have experienced sports injuries undergone reconstructive surgery and have had a crainiotomy to remove a brain tumor i have had chemo and a difficult rehab from partial paralysis but i have never experienced anything like the pain from e coli o157 h7 infection

6734403 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6734404 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6734405 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6734406 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6734407 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6734408 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6734409 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6734410 there has not been a rise in hackney carriage fares since april last year and since then the price of fuel has rocketed diesel is 27 higher than it was last year
6734411 any rise in fares is regrettable and the fare that the council has approved is the maximum a hackney carriage driver could charge
6734412 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6734413 the monstrosity of heroism when our fidelity to the cause compels us to transgress the threshold of our humanity
6734414 in political terms the difference between classical tragedy and modern tragedy is the difference between traditional tyranny and modern terror the traditional hero sacrifices himself for the cause he resists the pressure of the tyrant and accomplishes his duty cost what it may as such he is appreciated his sacrifice confers on him a sublime aura his act is inscribed in the register of tradition as an example to be followed
6734415 the knight of faith who dwells in the horrible domain beyond or between the two deaths since he is ready to sacrifice s what is most precious to him
6734416 the exact reversal of the aim of the first enlightenment

6734419 the player arrived in seville on thursday where he was met by the clubs professional football co ordinator pablo alfaro
6734420 every coach has his particular style and we are playing the way the coach wants us to play but the breakdowns have been a big problem
6734421 we run into gaps and we have shown that we have the capability to score tries but i feel that if we are going to win matches then we are going to have to commit players to the breakdown a lot more than we are at present
6734422 we have lost important possession at crucial stages of the past few games and it has cost us
6734423 kerk van de kathedraal van het kremlin wordt beschouwd als om n van mooiste in rusland
6734424 er werd een gereconstrueerd bioscoop dat jarenlang na de instorting van de sovjetunie verlaten bleef heropend maar wanneer waren zij erin geslaagd om dit te doen
6734425 ah ze sneden gewoon enkel het moderne asfalt weg en bereikten de 19de eeuw bestrating
6734426 na enige uren varen zagen we de zee en heel veel

6734429 it took a few months before i believed what i was seeing
6734430 these fmri images get people excited in a way that other research just doesnt
6734431 the pictures have a tremendous authority not only among scientists but among people who might just glance at a brain scan picture in a newspaper
6734432 there are so many bad brain imaging studies its hard to believe
6734433 too many of these experiments are being done by people who unfortunately dont really understand what the technology can and cannot do
6734434 has all the trappings of work with great lab cred big expensive and potentially dangerous machines hospitals and medical centers and a lot of people in white coats
6734435 you cant just put people in a scanner and ask them whatever question you want
6734436 many of these fmri papers are such oversimplifications of whats happening in the brain as to be worthless
6734437 little activity in areas of the brain associated with thought or feeling
6734438 by the publication of research that uses flawed reasoning to draw unfounded conclusions about topics as important as the presidential election
6734439 its important to ask what assumptions allowed the researchers to find these patterns of activity
6734440 but researchers should keep in mind that astrocytes are largely what fmri is measuring and not neural activity directly
6734441 it only takes about a week to learn how to do an fmri experiment
6734442 the only way to really know what the brain is doing is to look at the brain in a variety of different ways
6734443 each piece is a narrative interpretation of a different tarot card each taking a single card as its departure point the result is a set of cards that shimmer between the real and unreal between the borders of genre and that of an utterly unique reading

6734445 the welfare and quality of life of many pedigree dogs is seriously compromised by established breeding practices for appearance driven primarily by the rules and requirements of competitive dog showing and pedigree dog registration
6734446 all those who benefit from pedigree dogs have a collective responsibility to put aside vested interests and work together to ensure the health and welfare of the pedigree dog is protected
6734447 public attitude also needs to change so that the most desirable dogs are those which are fit healthy and well suited to the life they lead pedigree dogs need our help and they need it now
6734448 this is a man made problem that needs an urgent man made solution so lets work together and become the generation thats remembered for saving the pedigree dog

6734466 we started looking into the radial technique as an alternative to the groin in the late 1990s
6734467 the risk of major bleeding was markedly lower than from the groin

6734469 i just wanted the tribe to say yes we recognize that you are just as important as any other tribe member and we will treat you and your spouse as we treat all tribal members
6734470 it can do anything good or anything bad to the tribes and the indian people as citizen indians

6734477 there does not seem to be a whole lot of attention paid to our successes or to some of the struggles that we have in columbus the attention seems to be monopolized by the more urban districts
6734478 legislators add mandates without adding funding and then turn their backs when we have to be the people that say well now we need more money
6734479 in spite of mr mcintyres insistence that no client ever lost a dime this is not the standard
6734480 the supreme court has stated that the moment the lawyer succumbs to a temptation to appropriate for his own use any of his clients money entrusted to his safekeeping is the moment he shows his unfitness to be a practicing lawyer
6734481 at this time which would adversely affect your membership in the college because the committee concludes it lacks sufficient evidence on which to base a finding that you are deficient in moral character or professional competence or guilty of professional misconduct
6734482 these wild accusations when hes been serving the state of mississippi for the past 20 years
6734483 steve is a hard working man and we had nobody else to turn to its all politics
6734484 they dont say youve been exonerated dr hayne all they say is this committee lacked sufficient evidence
6734485 at the hearing they went over the procedures for the fair hearing and let us respond verbally
6734486 for an hour they posed different questions the hearing itself lasted two hours
6734487 its like a criminal defense lawyer being able to show up at trial and present all of the evidence and have none of the victims of the crime testify against you
6734488 if you only have the party youre investigating present and dont have any of the people conducting the investigation present to demonstrate his misconduct i cant really take the findings of that hearing very seriously
6734489 send hayne a letter of concern regarding the number of autopsies he conducts each year and that the results of the investigation be taken into consideration if additional evidence arises regarding that number
6734490 it is the declared policy of the state to promote capital market development and savings mobilization by establishing a legal and regulatory framework of retirement plans for persons comprised of voluntary personal savings and investments

6734499 its pretty dramatic because it allows a much taller building than the city would allow
6734500 it also pushes the building much further back and allows parking between hood avenue and the building
6734501 we put in our application to have the county zoning
6734502 with the market situation like this we cannot do a long range plan
6734503 early indicators are that people are going to be very cautious and price sensitive
6734504 i have no doubt about it that it could grow into that capacity
6734505 most likely we will phase the project which will require changes to our site concept and building elevations
6734506 we therefore prefer not to issue documents with faulty information while they are in a state of flux
6734507 i believe this is something that is very good for the city that will create good job opportunities
6734508 i dont want to do anything thats not good for the community
6734509 i believe in doing things that are nice and good that will uplift the community i am still contemplating my decision
6734510 i think they would be smart by doing a two story building because they would be fitting in with the western theme of town
6734511 i would say its probably too many rooms other people would say its not but it will have an impact

6734513 hitler knew she was jewish her real name was hedwig kiesler which was an obvious jewish name

6734517 the man started throwing wild punches at the woman who did not give up but kept punching back
6734518 men who harass women in public places should be expecting that kind of beating from women

6734521 we had a massive barney and ive not seen her since im gutted but at least this way i can claw some of my money back
6734522 shes upset and doesnt want lee to know where she is
6734523 we will move from singur whatever the cost to protect our people
6734524 tata expressed concern over the recent activities at singur and the proposed indefinite agitation of the trinamool congress demanding immediate return of 400 acres of land to farmers acquired for ancilliary industries of the tata group
6734525 we thought it would be good if you only had to draw your edit once and the software propagate the information from that single edit through the whole video
6734526 there are professional tools that can do these kind of edits but its an incredibly skilled procedure we believe that with this procedure anyone should be able to edit video
6734527 the famous painting hung in the place of honor in the salon carre and not a vestige of a clue was left by the person or persons who took it to aid the detectives and police in trying to trace it a search of every nook and cranny of the louvre from roof to cellar only brought to light the valuable frame in which the picture hung and the glass that covered it these were intact on a back staircase
6734528 some persons there are who believe that a practical joke has been played but nevertheless the government has set to work its entire force of detectives in an effort to recover the painting

6734535 when a man receives hormone therapy initially the treatment works well and his psa prostate specific antigen level goes down
6734536 but inevitably the psa will start climbing again and that is usually the first sign that the treatment is beginning to fail its a sign that the cancer in the prostate is making a comeback
6734537 the effects of the androgen receptor on hair growth in men vary dramatically depending on where in the body the receptor is working
6734538 when the receptor is very active in the mustache area more hair grows when its very active on the top of the skull toward the front hair falls out and men become bald and the hair on the back of the head is insensitive to the receptor the effects of hormones depend on the location
6734539 we found that the same is true within the cells of the prostate itself
6734540 tau is natively unfolded or floppy so in solution it moves around a lot and can adopt many different structures
6734541 with a normal protein you can measure the lengths of individual molecules and the average will be a pretty good description of any one
6734542 are all over the place theyre so diverse that its difficult to get one measurement that describes all of the possible structures
6734543 we generated lots and lots of structures for both normal tau and a mutant form
6734544 steel prices are maintained by the producers and if there is a hike the government will step in we have options we will examine the case if the prices are increased
6734545 the gap between domestic and international steel prices has reduced they have not come at par if the gap narrows down further we may look at revising our prices downward as of now the psu is maintaining the price line
6734546 there is now incontrovertible evidence that marketing of tobacco and the depiction of smoking in the movies promote youth smoking and can cause young people to begin smoking
6734547 this direct link between marketing and tobacco use is very powerful
6734548 anti tobacco ads before films and a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising are two effective strategies found to curb effects of tobacco images on youth now we need to use marketing to steer youth and others away from tobacco
6734549 if the communication bit rate falls below a certain rate it can switch to another colour to see if the communication improves
6734550 in order to intervene in this crucial segment access is needed and section 377 makes it difficult
6734551 sometimes we see too much of each other and get bored of each other so im glad weve been put in different classes
6734552 instead of spending 100 on you they only spend 50 each on you its shocking also if you want to be alone you cant because its their bedroom as well
6734553 you get a lot of privileges theres always someone to stick up for you at school and youre never lonely
6734554 you always have something to stick up for you when youre triplets im used to them sitting next to me but im looking forward to making new friends
6734555 we dont want them to be seen as the twins and triplets of the school we wanted them to be independent and make new friends
6734556 it will be easier for them to make new friends if theyre in different classes
6734557 in the fourth year thats just left we had three sets of twins so i dont know if theres something in the water round here
6734558 this is a very complex situation im of the view that parents with prams should move if a person with a wheelchair gets on board we have to have a public education campaign that makes it clear wheelchair users come first
6734559 a lot of parents would like to go to a meeting we think it would be more effective to speak to them face to face some of the letters lothian buses has sent back have been ridiculous comparing babies to dogs
6734560 any exclusion of prams from lothian buses services is likely to impact worst on poor families with no access to other forms of transport
6734561 i would like to see lothian buses looking at its fleet and seeing if the buses can be adapted to accommodate two spaces one for prams and one for wheelchairs
6734562 i do have sympathy with lothian buses because they are just trying to comply with the legislation but i would like to see the mothers and disability groups join up to fight together for better access for all
6734563 the nfda is working with the financial services authority to ensure that the regulations are as effective as possible and that they benefit businesses and consumers alike
6734564 i spotted joe quickly but he was trying to hide from the crowds by tucking in between a few people
6734565 he was wearing a baseball cap and real casual dress so he wouldnt stand out
6734566 he watched only her performance then walked backstage to the meet and greet area
6734567 but when he saw people start to recognize him he hid it was real obvious he didnt want people to know he was there to see taylor
6734568 hes an amazing guy and anybody would be lucky to be dating him
6734569 shes a great girl i think anybody would love to go on a date with her
6734570 jon was the type of guy who would help anyone in need rab was in so much pain with toothache that he was unable to go out on patrol jon being the great friend and soldier he was said he would take his place
6734571 its incredible to think that a few minutes later he was shot dead it is an absolute tragedy but it shows the courage that jon had
6734572 vehicles had to manoeuvre at right angles across the pavement
6734573 during the day the operative in charge of the roadworks was instructing people to mount the pavement but as night fell and with the failing light there was a number of angry exchanges with pedestrians shouting at motorists following a number of near misses
6734574 theres a railway line nearby and a family of foxes breeding there theres been a lot of food waste from our recent functions spilling out into the road and the foxes are having a rare old time
6734575 this would involve our solicitor going into court to argue that the council is acting illegally by preventing access to the premises this is obviously going to cost a couple of thousand pounds but we will certainly go down that road if we have to
6734576 tie previously gave us assurance that we would be able to gain access to our premises 24 7
6734577 we strive to accommodate the access needs of local residents and businesses wherever possible
6734578 the excavation in question has now been filled and is currently being fully reinstated we are confident that all necessary health and safety measures were taken during this phase of the work
6734579 we have no problem with this and in fact we are very happy with the level of support we get from nhs lothian
6734580 we are actively engaged in working with nhs lothian to develop an improved funding model for services we provide
6734581 the latest round of post office closures are another painful cut on services which have a great and detrimental impact on all our communities
6734582 we are making it clear to royal mail that we would like these closures reversed
6734583 local edinburgh mps nigel griffiths and mark lazarowicz all voted for this
6734584 at present both services are provided from different places making it less convenient for service users to take advantage of all the sexual health services we provide
6734585 providing a one stop service will also allow healthcare professionals to work more closely together in line with the scottish governments scottish sexual health strategy
6734586 anything that makes it easier for people to get advice and treatment is welcome in our eyes
6734587 it is hugely important that everyone has good access to high quality sexual health services
6734588 when you come back to edinburgh you will see big changes
6734589 but in terms of architecture he says he is a fan of allan murray and allan murray has done a lot of the architecture so i think theres a mixed message
6734590 i remember when the plans were explained to me and my first reaction was to think it wouldnt be possible to get through the planning hurdles however richard invited me down to see the model and it did move my opinion
6734591 theres no question that we need a new filmhouse and the council needs to play a central part in that
6734592 sir sean connery is the most famous scotsman and there should be a permanent marker to him in the city
6734593 this play has been a total challenge for the kids as were used to doing bright happy clappy musical numbers but this year we wanted to explore something more dark
6734594 amateur dramatics is where most of us start out i was about 12 when i did my first amateur shows with the mcmasters stage school and music theatre for youth
6734595 its my first time at the festival and ive seen a whole range of shows but i honestly couldnt tell you which were amateur and which were professional they were all so good
6734596 i am absolutely delighted and surprised in a way because we were doing a play that wasnt an obvious box office draw
6734597 potter is most well known as a tv screenwriter but when i saw the play i always thought that it would be better performed on stage and i think weve just been proved right
6734598 i started in am dram myself we never had any of the encouragement on offer here today which is why awards like this are so important
6734599 ive read toms reviews for many years and i must say its an honour to receive his commendation but my fiercest critic is still my mother so i was even more delighted when she found our play enthralling
6734600 they were absolutely tiny about the size of my hand the box was lined with a towel and theyd been cleaned and fed they were obviously just away from their mother they still had their umbilical cords attached
6734601 we reckon they were a day old they are very fortunate not to have fallen prey to scavengers because they are so small they could have been eaten by seagulls
6734602 we still have to wait and see whether they are all right they were taken from their mother so young they could be vulnerable to infections
6734603 the first milk they get from their mother is crucial as it contains a substance called colostrum which builds their immune systems a critical time for them will be when they are about 14 days old
6734604 this was a very callous act were keen to hear from anyone who knows who owned them were also very concerned about the mother who will be distraught given the puppies were dumped in this way its likely she is not being well cared for
6734605 theyre doing fine at the moment their eyes are still shut they wont open till they are ten or 14 days old
6734606 theyve now got a foster mum in the form of a teddy bear theyre getting bottle fed a special powdered milk for puppies if someone hadnt found them they wouldnt have survived long there will be a very distressed female dog somewhere
6734607 the owners have been extremely irresponsible if they cant cope with puppies they should have approached someone for help
6734608 the idea was put to me and i liked it discussions then took place with the school and the council and eventually two years later here we are
6734609 i am absolutely delighted to house the station and to be the only school in the uk to have one
6734610 i think there is so much more to come as well particularly when we hit fm i am sure we will gain confidence and people will come forward with ideas for how the station can develop
6734611 being involved has been a great learning experience for me and presenting live on air has boosted my confidence
6734612 i will continue to present and improve my skills and hopefully training will allow me to take broadcasting further in the future
6734613 i hope to sort it out over the weekend and next week we will be handing the supplies over
6734614 im glad he seems to have found another way of getting the supplies in but it shouldnt have to come to this
6734615 and it is going to be rainy from saturday to sunday
6734616 we could see some locally heavy downpour but we dont expect a flooding like in florida
6734617 the threat to us isnt any greater than what wed have under a heavy thunderstorm
6734618 were trying to see what this silly thing is going to do
6734619 and we will have swells come in from the system in addition to higher waves crashing on shore and rip currents along the beaches
6734620 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
6734621 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women
6734622 on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
6734623 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behaviour and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
6734624 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed
6734625 es gibt viele die sagen ich habe das geld meine lebenszeit ist begrenzt also mache ich das jetzt
6734626 hierher kommen leute die viel geld haben und bereit sind viel auszugeben
6734627 verglichen mit anderen etwa dem sammeln von kunstwerken alter meister ist dies noch ein eher billiges hobby
6734628 jedes auto das hier gewinnt ist automatisch eine million wert in der regel mehr
6734629 id like to take this opportunity to say congratulations to all those who have made such positive efforts to kick the habit very well done
6734630 this shows that the investments that we are making in helping smokers to quit are having a positive impact
6734631 optimists enrich the present enhance the future challenge the improbable and attain the impossible
6734632 ich war zu sehr auf gold fixiert das war nicht meine woche das waren nicht meine olympischen spielen
6734633 ich bin heilfroh ber bronze denn seit langem war klar dass fabian nicht in der form war die f r einen olympiasieg n tig gewesen w re
6734634 das habe man nicht publik gemacht um den jungen nicht zus tzlich zu verunsichern
6734635 ich war geschockt nach bronze hatte er mir noch fr hlich gratuliert
6734636 ich war in superform noch nie so gut drauf ich hatte die meisten finals und damit das h rteste programm psychisch und physisch war ich super drauf
6734637 ich habe ihn r de angemacht und ihn gefragt ob er noch alle tassen im schrank habe
6734638 wer bist du eigentlich der es wagen kann mich hier so anzumachen
6734639 ber das weitere vorgehen werden wir jetzt in ruhe zu hause beraten und dann an die ffentlichkeit gehen
6734640 ich habe meine einsch tzung nicht auf das reck sondern seine gesamtform bezogen an verschiedenen ger ten hat er in peking zehntel liegen lassen am reck aber habe ich ihm durchaus zugetraut dass er gewinnen kann
6734641 i disagree with funkes conclusion no 1 that all of leibens skin and organ infections were treatable and no 2 that they all were attributable to her care
6734642 my disagreement is with the source the cause of death and that she blames it all on the care leiben received
6734643 some of us were lucky to get to go to school some of us had to go to work
6734644 since the 70th we decided we were losing too many
6734645 it was hard for a lot of kids to find jobs
6734646 if a woman was married she couldnt hold a job theyd give that job to a man
6734647 it was a lot better than it is now life was a lot simpler
6734648 i dont think we were under as much pressure as the kids are today
6734649 i could have done better if i put myself to it
6734650 the evidence is overwhelming that there is a specialized system dedicated to processing faces and not other objects
6734651 why we are so good at recognizing and remembering faces
6734652 a brief glance at a face conveys a wealth of information about identity expression gender age mood intent attractiveness social states and even honesty
6734653 the ability to extract this information within a fraction of a second of viewing a face is important for normal social interaction and has probably played a critical role in the survival of our primate ancestors
6734654 are completely baffled why robbers cover their faces in movies
6734655 its like viewing grains of sugar rather than the whole cube
6734656 a region could serve more than one function said scott huettel a professor of psychiatry at duke university in durham n c
6734657 just by looking at an fmri we can tell if a subject is looking at faces or places
6734658 i saw images of me hurting him very badly and the voices were telling me to hurt him
6734659 it got so bad that as i was walking along a street i would be looking at the roofs of buildings looking for snipers on top of them who i thought were going to shoot me
6734660 but the psychiatrist told me that i had psychotic symptoms which were leading to depression
6734661 when he told me about the psychosis i wasnt as upset as youd think i was just pleased that i finally knew what was wrong with me
6734662 i have been on a couple of different kinds of drugs and some of them have made me worse
6734663 but the one i am on at the moment has been ok
6734664 i have started to go out more again and make new friends
6734665 and so i dont feel so alone i feel as though i am a normal person now but one who has an illness that can be treated
6734666 having a mental illness doesnt mean it has to affect the whole of the rest of my life its just something i have to deal with sometimes
6734667 a significant proportion of people who have a psychotic episode will never have another
6734668 there is one prerequisite for a mammatus formation a big thunderstorm because they form on the back edge of retreating storms
6734669 there is one prerequisite for a mammatus formation a big thunderstorm because they form on the back edge of retreating storms
6734670 as you know i was very impressed by your plans for the area and the work which has already been undertaken our boat trip provided an excellent vantage point and i look forward to seeing the project completed
6734671 it sounds like the first minister has trumped the planning committee
6734672 as head of the body which is the final arbiter on the application this is an unusual declaration of support for proposals yet to be decided by the planning committee never mind the scottish government
6734673 it is another example of the first minister treading on dangerous waters
6734674 generally speaking it is not prudent for any government minister to comment on planning applications until the process is completed alex salmond might have been better advised to hold his tongue until then
6734675 obviously when a scheme is approved it is appropriate for a first minister to say he is delighted it has got to that point but for him to intervene at this stage is a little bit previous
6734676 restrictions on public comment apply only to the planning minister or ministers engaged in the planning process while the application is before ministers
6734677 when youre this good at doing something you dont do it for free
6734678 with lau the asian accountant the joker planned to be caught he wanted me to lock him up in the mcu
6734679 weve all got a kind of love hate relationship with the university of washington
6734680 affects the health safety or security of any member of the university community or the mission of the university
6734681 we have a responsibility to educate our students about being responsible citizens
6734682 we put the last 25 000 mtvs on hold and i asked how is it that we got to this point
6734683 we are currently gathering data and information from marines returning from oif and oef
6734684 once all the data is collected and analyzed we will approach industry for possible new designs and or changes to the current body armor
6734685 would allow greater mobility with reduced thermal stress in high elevations thick vegetation and tropical environments
6734686 now the marines who are wearing the mtv repetitively dont like it so much
6734687 it is heavier it gives a little more protection that is one of the net positives with it we still need a lighter vest that gives us the same amount of protection
6734688 for the most part we think the vest has particular application in afghanistan because once again if youre climbing up and down mountains you want to be protected but you dont want to be weighed down so much that youre just going to be sapped
6734689 i like the idea of modularization as long as you had some pieces that you could add or subtract
6734690 personal protection should be just that its a personal choice at some point
6734691 a lot has to be left to the commander threats will vary in different locations
6734692 you may have a sniper threat in one place and a shrapnel threat in another you may have a commander whose force mainly rides to the fight and another one that has to climb up the side of mountains
6734693 that weve got these various types of armor vest is marvelous

6734708 there are not many fast corners but the straights are quite quick with a few kinks on them its quicker than the normal street circuit theyve done a good job with it
6734709 the first part of the track is a bit like montreal with a lot of chicanes but after that its sort of a street circuit of its own
6734710 i think well have a safety car or two in the race which can blow the results around a bit but hey if were on the receiving end of a bit of luck this time why not

6734724 jimmy carters long history of anti israel bias has rendered him unfit to address the democratic convention it is incumbent upon the democratic party leadership and senator obama to remove carter from the program in denver the democratic party and senator obamas continued embrace of carter and his anti israel bias sends a troubling message to the jewish community it stands in stark contrast to the gop and john mccains pro israel stance
6734725 additionally senator obama should reject carters superdelegate vote the hand that shook khaled meshals should not be allowed to rise in support of senator obamas candidacy for president

6734746 they feel like theyre making good progress they dont have a hard timeline to share on when that will be complete but its important to bring it back up to operations as safely and quickly as we can
6734747 we were able to get through last weekend with some temporary runouts weve decided that were better off to temporarily close a small number of stations
6734748 were not able to make up all the volumes that we would like to but the fact that we have these contracts in place has given us more flexibility than we would otherwise have if we were only dealing with petro canada
6734749 at this point we are counting on petro canada to have their processing unit back up within a reasonable time so that these closures will be temporary we have not made any decisions beyond that
6734750 you might see an impact if you had numerous refineries with an issue like this but so far i dont think that weve noticed any effect on the price
6734751 its great if youre a refinery because it blocks competition and helps you keep our prices up
6734752 but its not good for consumers and at times like this its not good for our operations either because we cant get any gas

6734796 on one hand landlords are trying to offset increased costs and on the other hand high interest rates deter renters from making the shift into home ownership
6734797 the shortage of affordable accommodation will no doubt add to the growing number of displaced renters who cant afford to live in well located areas
6734798 this latest rental report provides clear evidence that disaffected would be homeowners are driving up rental values in the most unaffordable capitals
6734799 weighing up the available domestic and international information the board judged that the cash rate should remain unchanged this month
6734800 nonetheless with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
6734801 i think that a drop in rates would be very timely and will create a wave of consumer confidence and relief for many homeowners
6734802 wed see an upturn in new building construction investment confidence rental availability and hence an easing on housing affordability
6734803 in finance circles there seems to be a feeling that a cut in official interest rates should be considered sooner rather than later because the real flow on effect takes approximately three quarters to see a real impact

6734806 just like the sharemarket has blue chip stocks which are largely protected from any sustained downturn the property market has blue chip locations that will generally provide a safe haven from any sustained market downturn
6734807 with capital growth now softening nationally rental increases are once again outpacing house and unit price growth leading to stronger rental yields across the market

6734811 the june quarter housing data is the weakest weve observed since 2004 this quarter we recorded widespread falls across australias major capitals and we expect this trend to continue
6734812 its likely these results are the canary down the coal mine and that rapidly rising mortgage rates and a looming economic slowdown will usher in a sustained period of property market weakness
6734813 strong migration patterns and rising gross rental yields arent enough to attract either first homebuyers who are put off by rising mortgage costs or investors who are spoilt for choice given that many asset classes are providing excellent cash returns
6734814 the growing number of unsold properties sitting on the market is exacerbating the situation there are currently more than 25 000 extra properties on the market nationally when compared to this time last year more vendors are competing for the attention of fewer buyers which results in pressure to discount
6734815 we expect a further 10 dip in house and unit values across most major capitals over the next 12 months

6734837 with the population growing at the fastest rate in 20 years and the rental market super tight the risk is that rate cut speculation could spark a new rush into the housing market the fear of being left behind or even worse shut out was behind previous surges in house prices
6734838 clearly house prices have slowed markedly over the past six months but thats hardly a surprise in the wake of sharp rises in mortgage interest rates but in contrast to the last slowdown in 2005 australian house prices have been quite resilient
6734839 when you consider that population is growing at the fastest rate in almost 20 years building has slowed to a crawl and the vacancy rate is super tight its clear theres no shortage of supportive factors
6734840 over the past 20 years australian house prices grew on average at 8 2 annually and thats precisely what they rose by over the past year
6734841 not only is the rental market super tight but population growth continues to strengthen and speculation has shifted to rate cuts if rates are cut in coming months investors could easily swing from cash based investments and the share market to the property market
6734842 those analysts who believe that house prices are set to plunge have to come up with an explanation about where australias growing population is going to live

6734866 the anonymous benefactor insists this is the only way to do it the safest too for the mere sanctity of the church will blast it back to the pit
6734867 how can she even enter the church in the first place
6734868 someone explained this to me if the demon intends no ill will in the church then the sanctity of the building has no cause to eject it as soon as the demons intentions change the full force of the blessings come into play
6734869 i for one dont want to be lashed with a whip of fire
6734870 ive never heard of a demon possessing a man what would be the point of that
6734871 i now pronounce you man and wife i abjure thee unholy spirit and son of satan to leave this poor mortal you may now kiss the bride saint michael the archangel defend us in battle be our defence against the wickedness and snares of the devil may god rebuke him we humbly pray

6734892 one of the most important things i look for when i evaluate a healing community and i think has that raw material is how well they provide the holistic care to their patients do you go past just the automatic reflexive life saving intervention you made on somebody to open a closed artery and make sure it doesnt happen again do you educate the community do you see each patient as part of an army that can go home and share the lessons youve shared with them so they can pass on the information and if we can do this intelligently we can build an america thats a lot healthier to live in

6735078 mr gadd says his trial in vietnam was a charade and a travesty of justice he never got a fair trial
6735079 this morning was an opportunity for him to come before an english court and english justice for the first time and make these points
6735080 unfortunately the court did not agree to my submission that the court should hear about the unfairness of his treatment at the hands of the vietnamese justice system
6735081 mr gadd wants through me to say to you that he did not commit the offences of which he was convicted in vietnam it was a show trial and he had no opportunity to put his case forward
6735082 its her character im playing so we talked about it i asked are there any pippa tendencies you want to talk about
6735083 but she said what are you talking about i saw your reading and copied you
6735084 so i didnt have to worry about doing anything that robin was doing
6735085 i havent even heard about it i dont ever pay attention to that stuff
6735086 shes one of my best friends in the whole wide world and honestly when youre sitting in a room for three hours doing satellite interviews

6735088 it enabled mr gadd and others to put into practice a plan for his proper and safe arrival here
6735089 there has been no opportunity to put forward why he was innocent of those crimes for which he was convicted in vietnam
6735090 he did not commit the offences for which he was convicted in vietnam
6735091 it was a show trial and he had no opportunity to put his defence forward ultimately he wants that to be tested if he can before the courts of this country

6735093 a longer period of consolidation in the 800 840 range would help gold establish a much stronger base offering the physical base more time to adjust to higher prices
6735094 now we have tensions between russia and nato we have financial market risk
6735095 u s real interest rates are still negative which makes the opportunity cost of holding gold lower there are so many reasons for gold to become stronger
6735096 i got over the wanting to be cool thing a long time ago and found it quite liberating once you stop worrying about how you might be perceived even in character its strangely freeing

6735280 no formal decision has been made by customs and border protection to change the targeted completion date for the project in question
6735281 we understand hidalgo county may be exploring options for cost savings as is cbp but we remain committed to completing our goals by the end of the calendar year

6735290 we respect the right of the pakistan cricket board to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible

6735299 we spoke to andrew and made him our best offer
6735300 we have given him time to go away and consider that offer and are awaiting his response
6735301 i have no indication at present as to what way he is leaning but i do hope to have an answer from him by the weekend
6735302 the offer is on the table and it is up to andrew if he wants to come and play for linfield
6735303 we are down to basically 16 players which is enough to field a team and fill the bench
6735304 i have already had to play steven douglas out of position at left back this season with conor hagan on the right and now i have lost both of them
6735305 we will adapt to the situa tion and bring some players in and deal with the injuries we have as we have always done
6735306 alan came to training last night suffering with a toothache and an abscess
6735307 he is in a lot of pain he has been in pain while in scotland and he hasnt slept
6735308 it is the measure of the man that he still turned up at training although he went home without taking part he is hoping that he can play on saturday but i will have no concerns if stuart addis has to start
6735309 i was pleased with him on tuesday night and his application and attitude have been first class since he came to the club in the summer

6735322 the car is not completely silent when it is running as it does generate some road noise

6735341 she seems genuinely connected to opportunities in the future and how they will help people on the ground
6735342 she balances a sense of urgency as a business leader with the ability to have patience as a government leader

6735353 the olympics has been a real set back for any freedom of expression speech and assembly in beijing
6735354 several have been detained and otherwise prevented from communicating with the people they normally communicate with
6735355 the opportunity for protesters to demonstrate in a peaceful manner has been nearly nonexistent because protest zones miles from the games and permits which are needed for a legal protest have not been permitted
6735356 but none of the people who applied for permits got them and several of them have been arrested instead

6735383 the enemies know they only have a few more months left to fight before winter so they are focusing all their energies on the provinces that will be inaccessible due to snowfall on the passes between pakistan and afghanistan
6735384 as you know khost has a long border with pakistan so it is easy for insurgents to get across
6735385 the isi must stop using radicalism and extremism as an instrument of policy unless the use of these young men as tools of radicalization and as weapons to promote whatever agenda they have stops we will have continued attacks
6735386 they stay in the same room and every day are told that if they make jihad on the foreigners they will go to paradise they are told that the afghan soldiers have converted to christianity at the end of 40 days all of them are asked who wants to make jihad all of them raise their hands

6735461 for the wfp and the wider un and ngo community the air hub was critical for the provision of vital relief supplies to the people of myanmar
6735462 so far everything that has been received demonstrates we have no problem for the eligibility of the competitors
6735463 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6735464 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6735465 drawing too many games at home was one of the reasons we didnt challenge for the title last season we cant lose so many points at home this season if we want to be up there
6735466 a lot of teams do the same by defending at anfield but we have to find the solution to make sure we win games like this
6735467 my mother would come home and talk about her work but truly this was the only time i ever saw her break down
6735468 she was a top notch nurse because she loved it
6735469 the biggest thing about a quarantine at this time of year is the impact on the wine grape industry
6735470 whether an inmates crime was especially callous or shockingly vicious or lethal
6735471 the ultimate conclusion that an inmate continues to pose an unreasonable risk to public safety
6735472 im ready to start living my life i couldnt do that before because it was so up in the air
6735473 the awesome responsibility of deciding whether to release a convicted murderer on parole an act that inherently runs the risk that the inmate will again kill an innocent person lies with the executive branch not the judicial branch
6735474 expects russia to abide by its agreement to withdraw forces
6735475 there is no bread there is no food no medicine people are dying
6735476 i cannot go on like this anymore i cry every day
6735477 we are waiting for the russians to respect their word
6735478 we waited twice with dashed hopes this time it appears that there is at least the beginning of a fulfillment
6735479 its not they its we who will erase them from the face of earth
6735480 we want everyone to know the truth about the terrible events in tskhinvali with the hope that such a thing will never again happen on our land
6735481 texting while driving is so obviously unsafe that its hard to believe anyone would attempt it yet everyday observation suggests there are an awful lot of folks who do
6735482 there is already sufficient law that can be applied if someone is driving while distracted
6735483 we dont need a law for everything a driver does the next one is going to be you cant drive while you are eating a hamburger
6735484 using an electronic wireless communications device to write send or read a text based communication
6735485 it was good to see them in action and obviously the likes of rowly and hogan are in my thoughts ahead of the doncaster game
6735486 i would hope manx gas can continue to absorb what costs they can and that this remains the case at the end of the winter heating period
6735487 we have been assured by the company that the fuel cost adjustment will be reduced or removed if the amount they pay for gas falls
6735488 this could still be feasible but i am able to confirm that i am satisfied that the companys profits for the last accounting period are within an acceptable range
6735489 it is our job to ensure that consumers are being charged a fair price and that although gas is currently expensive there is no excessive profiteering
6735490 ive come here for the chance to play regular football but i dont expect to walk into the side
6735491 i watched last weeks game against spurs from the stands and i was very impressed ive seen david wheater play for middlesbrough before and for the england under 21s and i know that hes a fantastic defender hes a great centre back but he showed that he can play just as well at right back
6735492 you have to have competition for places it was the same at arsenal i hope to get the nod at middlesbrough but i know i will have to fight for my place because the players in the team at the moment want to stay there
6735493 no one was going to touch me today i felt fantastic
6735494 i went into the race knowing i was the strongest paddler
6735495 i had an excellent start and i knew from that moment no one is going to go past me
6735496 we will conduct a comprehensive review of all our programmes
6735497 i like all fans of team usa am extremely disappointed with the performance of our relays
6735498 islam dibangun atas lima rukun sahadat laa ilaha illallah dan muhammad utusan allah menegakkan shalat membayar zakat haji dan puasa ramadhan
6735499 if you look at the totality of the whole thing its shaping up to be a good project for the community
6735500 i am pleased to see the enhancements its better for the community it makes it a better project
6735501 is that enough for us to vote for it thats still to be told
6735502 we must ask the city council to make a decision
6735503 the city council needs to continue to drive the best deal for the community
6735504 there is absolutely no logical explanation as to why we so often play below our capabilities here
6735505 that was a game thats easy to sum up there was absolutely nothing new here we just cant seem to get our game going when were here
6735506 we have only ourselves to blame for dropping the points we took the lead played quite well and then conceded a really horrible and stupid goal those kinds of mistakes just cant be allowed to happen whether youre in the flow of things are not
6735507 people should not be forced to say or do things they believe are morally wrong
6735508 health care workers should not be forced to provide services that violate their own conscience
6735509 the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6735510 people should not be forced to say or do things that they find morally wrong
6735511 words in that draft led some to misconstrue the departments intent
6735512 this regulation is consistent with my intent to focus squarely on the issue of conscience rights this specifically goes to the issue of abortion and conscience
6735513 this regulation does not seek to resolve any ambiguity in that area it focuses on abortion and focuses on physicians conscience in relation to that
6735514 i think this provides broad application not just to abortion and sterilization but any other type of morally objectionable procedure and research activity
6735515 we think its badly needed our members are facing discrimination every day and as we get into human cloning and all sorts of possibilities its going to become even more important
6735516 there is nothing in this rule that would in any way change a patients right to a legal procedure
6735517 participating in any activity with a reasonable connection to the objectionable procedure including referrals training and other arrangements for offending procedures
6735518 not a very good track record especially at an expensive hospital like that

6735526 i want somebody whos independent somebody who can push against my preconceived notions and challenge me so we have got a robust debate in the white house
6735527 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6735528 if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6735529 were delighted to have a debate on judgment with barack obama who bought his own million dollar mansion in a shady deal with a convicted felon senator obama is obviously frustrated and abandoning his politics of hope for negative personal attacks
6735530 i heard the lightning and then i saw the flash
6735531 it looked like somebody took a picture then i saw the bricks come down and realized it had struck the house
6735532 researchers have speculated that tumors give off different odors but were the first to identify and quantify the compounds involved in skin cancer odors
6735533 a different profile of chemicals above tumor sites relative to healthy skin the same chemicals are present but at skin cancer sites some chemicals are increased while others are decreased compared to healthy individuals
6735534 open doors to potential new approaches to skin cancer diagnosis based on the profile of skin odors hopefully leading to more rapid and non invasive detection and diagnosis
6735535 we do not want to suggest any price band at present our efforts are aimed at securing a long term contract for iron ore supply between miners and steel producers they should follow it on the lines of nmdc
6735536 as far as revision of iron ore prices are concerned nmdc has entered into long term contracts with japanese steel makers for the period 2005 06 to 2011 but prices are fixed between them every year
6735537 we have made our point that high freight charges and ad valorem export duty on iron ore are hitting our margins it is now up to the government to decide whether we should seek higher price for our high quality iron ore from japanese and korean mills or not
6735538 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
6735539 they want amnesty they want open borders and they want a more vulnerable america
6735540 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6735541 its very cool my husband has a rum business jolly roger rum so i had to come down to see this
6735542 when you are in the open water you hear no engine you see no land you have the noise of the wind that brings you back

6735546 this is my scene the pressure was on me he has beaten me four times before and he is strong he has such raw strength
6735547 but i got through it my training my tactics were perfect it was all spot on
6735548 ive made it to the olympic final its unbelievable now i want to hear my national anthem and it will make me cry
6735549 hes just not the kind of person you could see doing something like this
6735550 he has carried a lot on his shoulders his whole life
6735551 really i think the kid was ready to fall apart the whole two years he was here
6735552 if he had a problem he would tell us but he would struggle with it
6735553 i think that everything building up over time and things like that he just gave up
6735554 he had a good life he had a good life to live
6735555 i think hes two weeks away from a return once he gets over the knee problem it will be about getting his touch and fitness back
6735556 he needs games for that but it will be great when hes back available again like another new signing
6735557 the army and police arrested a suspected bomber not far away from scene of the attack
6735558 i looked back and saw the limbs of my colleagues flying through the air

6735560 reaffirmed their mutual support for going after these extremists that are a threat to both pakistan the united states and the entire world
6735561 the future of this coalition is linked to the restoration of judges

6735566 have fun at work make people wonder what youre up to
6735567 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
6735568 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
6735569 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
6735570 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
6735571 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
6735572 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
6735573 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
6735574 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
6735575 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
6735576 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
6735577 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
6735578 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
6735579 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
6735580 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
6735581 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
6735582 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
6735583 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
6735584 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
6735585 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
6735586 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
6735587 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
6735588 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
6735589 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
6735590 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
6735591 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
6735592 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
6735593 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
6735594 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
6735595 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
6735596 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
6735597 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
6735598 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

6735622 we are utterly resolute in our determination to support this new democracy of afghanistan
6735623 we wont relax our efforts to support and reconstruct afghanistan because we understand that what happens in afghanistan affects the rest of the world
6735624 we are determined to work with the afghan government and coalition forces to defeat the forces of terrorism
6735625 plotting in the cabinet is not new it happens in afghanistan too but not to me
6735626 we have succeeded in winning back territory the longer term solution is that more power will be given to the afghanistan people

6735637 when you look at all of the statin trials together what they show is there is no overall effect on cancer either increasing it or preventing it
6735638 we found a very interesting thing which is that in those studies the lower the ldl level the higher the risk of cancer it was a pretty strong effect
6735639 there was about a three fold increase in cancer going from the highest ldl levels to the lowest ldl levels
6735640 statins on average lowered ldl by about 40 points so if statins did cause cancer that 40 point drop in ldl cholesterol should have produced eight more cancers
6735641 so in the statin group we would expect to see 20 cancers per thousand person years per thousand people per year instead what we found was 12 7 which was the exact same as in placebo patients

6735652 in the current climate we knew that the creation of a major study of consumer intentions was absolutely paramount as marketing budgets come under the most intense pressure
6735653 closely monitoring changes in willingness to respond and acceptability in both communications channels and product sectors means that marketers and planners can move from a retrospective analysis to a genuine partnership with the consumer

6735686 en la crisis del lenguaje po tico contempor neo observamos que hay poetas que rompen los diques de contenci n de la verbalidad otros que en cambio tratan de reducir la expansi n f sica del discurso verbal a esta segunda categor a pertenece por derecho la expresividad de blanca varela claro est que la distinci n es puramente fenomenol gica y no supone jerarquizaci n alguna hiperverbales e hipoverbales tiene las mismas probabilidades de acertar o desacertar en sus realizaciones expresivas

6735696 well the album came out this year but wed been playing together with most of the original line up for about 2 years and there was a lot of pressure to do a new album right away and we took our time the band hadnt done a record in a long time for a number of reasons and when this line up got back together we just decided to play some shows and build on our strength to really just get together we did have some complaints from the fans that we shouldnt tour so much we should just put a record out but you know what that touring really helped prepare us and i think the record came out naturally and better because of it i dont think it would have been as good if we had rushed it
6735697 oh yeah i did it was a very different experience doing it now than doing it before
6735698 well it was a slightly different approach ive been out of it for a long time and ive been doing very different music so for me it felt right to just kinda ease back into it and the previous testament record the gathering i thought is the one where they really sorta found their formula outside of the original line up and i wanted that process to continue cause thats a great album so i didnt just wanna come in and expect it to be like it was 20 years ago when everybody was writing
6735699 absolutely and i think i was able to bring some of that influence not just by writing music but also by listening to what they were coming up with and really making suggestions and i did write some stuff thats on there
6735700 not a whole lot i did more of like arranging and listening and suggesting there is a whole song f e a r which i wrote music and lyrics and its kinda funny i got this reputation of being like the melodic guy in the band by writing more mellow stuff a lot of people think thats one of the heaviest songs
6735701 not really only with some of the guitar stuff but as far as the arrangements and the concept of it we tried different things eric and i have tried some different ideas and it seems to come together naturally that was supposed to be an instrumental we were practically done with the whole song and chuck came in with some lyrics for it and just to try it it just took on a whole new life and now its one of the most popular songs on the record
6735702 so i said let me go in and try something the next monday i came up with the lyrics and recorded it and it fell just right
6735703 it just became a completely different type of song and its a good closer song
6735704 i think so i think its a possibility we have a friend that is coming to some of the east coast shows that is going to film we havent filmed so far on this tour but if we capture the stuff that our friend is gonna shoot i think its gonna be cool
6735705 oh yeah absolutely but that is funny everything we do is all over youtube so the fans need a good quality dvd that captures the energy of the shows you know the first thing we did when we got back together it was to film a dvd but i think right now we are light years beyond that so a dvd of whats going on now will just destroy the last one
6735706 i think more so now because in the early 90s there was the whole alternative music revolution
6735707 yeah but not for long theres also the fact that the record couldnt have come out back then cause we didnt sound like this this record is the result of the experience that we had in those days this line up been going separate ways then coming back together and finding a new place to work from and also the fact that the environment out there is exciting because theres a lot of young fans that are re discovering our classic music and they are supporting the new music so we have this fan base that looks like the one we had 20 years ago and its the same age crowd mixed with some of the older fans out there too so i really think that the new record is the result of that so touring now is much more inspiring
6735708 we didnt expect it to go this far we got back together for a few reunion shows that went really well the line up kept changing as well on drums but i feel this is the line up that feels the strongest this is the line up that created this new records end resurgence so we dont see slowing down anytime soon
6735709 yeah its possible we actually re recorded the souls of black album but its not out yet we did it during the formation of damnation recording it may show up on a video game nothing i can talk right now cause its not official but we have the tracks so its possible it could come out on cd as well
6735710 well if im going to play metal its gotta be real theres a few reasons behind it i didnt play metal in years and in fact im proud that the metal i played was real metal i kinda took a risk by playing metal cause most other guitar players would go play more commercial stuff and at one point i was really comfortable with my jazz playing like i never expected to be in downbeat magazine which is like the rolling stone of jazz and i was in jazz is magazine played a few jazz festivals so once my jazz thing was going i felt that theres room if i wanted to be in a metal project so i think i was in a place where i wanted to re explore metal and right around that time lamb of god called me to play solo on the title track of ashes of the wake chris poland is also on that i went to see them at ozzfest then i met the guys from slipknot and they were very complimentary about my playing even zakk wylde has heard my jazz stuff but it was also clear that it would be cool to do some metal stuff and a very short time later i got a call from chuck it was perfect it was like fate so here we are
6735711 absolutely they are three very intense different and hard working projects it could be a little overwhelming sometimes but its very fulfilling its great
6735712 well its a very different environment its the type of thing where you sit and listen and you dont talk loud theres no moshpit its just about listening to the music it requires paying attention to the music but a lot of people have showed up not thinking they will like it and really like it because when you pay attention and you just listen it can be as exciting as another metal show in a very different way
6735713 thats true i think when you first listen to jazz its not in your face like metal it takes a little effort its like art in a way theres certain type of art you have to learn about to really appreciate it and with jazz thats often been the case because a lot of the songs are these old standard jazz repertoire and you have to study them to really appreciate whats going on in a jazz concert but with us the standards that we do youll recognize because theres song by the scorpions judas priest ozzy and even kiss so you recognize the form so you dont have to be a seasoned jazz listener to get it but the process totally comes from jazz so the pure jazz fans like it cause they can relate to it so are the rock fans some rock metal fans have been checking more into jazz because of us and its a huge compliment but we play originals too the originals have their own excitement
6735714 this tour takes us to the rest of the month then i have the trio tour the first half of september then testament goes to japan then australia we have 10 city dates in october in the states then ill do trans siberian orchestra in november december and in early spring testament is gonna start up again so there will be a lot of testament activities in 2009
6735715 well we will definitely write some material while we are not touring and possibly get back to the studio in early 2010

6735897 wheres betty perhaps his grace would like a lift to the station
6735898 ive never seen such a shambles at a wedding in my life
6735899 though i could arrange the bishop to come into contact with some
6735900 whatever the bishop may say or do to me i wouldnt want any harm to come to him
6735901 shall we go to the tea shop in the park

6735903 not a demon but not an angel either a saintly one condemned to serve in hell youre not one of those that refused to choose a side at the fall so you must have been a saintly mortal championing the cause of limbo
6735904 but there was a monk who defended the existence of limbo against the church and st augustine an english monk i name you pelagius
6735905 thats an unholy act youve damned yourself meddling in the black arts
6735906 i know your nature you must have seen the memo

6735914 we need to relieve the burden on the va from routine health care
6735915 if you have a routine health care need take it wherever you want whatever doctor or health care provider and get the treatment you need while we at the va focus our attention our care our love on these grievous wounds of war
6735916 received consistently better care across the board including screening diagnosis treatment and follow up
6735917 ideologues like john mccain and george bush hate the fact that the va exists
6735918 they hate the fact that theres a functional example out there of the government providing better care at a lower cost than the private sector
6735919 the problem that the va faces now is that the bush administration failed to hire enough doctors and disability claims adjusters when they chose to go to war with iraq if these doctors had been hired the va would be an example of the government doing good work bush and mccain dont want the public to see that
6735920 if im driving a humvee in iraq and a roadside bomb explodes and i veer off the road and crush my arm and end up losing it and needing a prosthetic is that a combat wound according to sen mccain
6735921 if mccain would work to properly fund va care there would be no issue about a va card
6735922 mccain by wanting to give vets private care is walking away from the va and ignoring the problem
6735923 for every vet who would get a va card that would be one less vet using the va
6735924 would mean in a short period of time a smaller budget fewer locations and the eventual dismantling of the best health care system in the country

6735936 intinya kita memerlukan penghematan dari pelaku bisnis dan mal tapi itu bukan paksaan sifatnya
6735937 kita kan hanya butuh 200 mw kalau mereka ramai ramai berhemat sedikit sedikit tentu akan menurunkan beban
6735938 itu adalah bagian dari strategi mereka jadi kita tidak akan memaksa pelanggan bisnis yang tidak mempunyai genset supaya dia membeli genset
6735939 jadi wajar kalau mereka menjadi prioritas pertama yang terkena pemadaman dibandingkan dengan pelanggan yang sudah melakukan penghematan

6735956 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
6735957 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels it is vital that sensitive information such as prisoner records is held securely at all times
6735958 the data was held in a secure format on the contractors site it was downloaded onto a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost

6736070 the conduct of the security service facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the united states when mohamed was being detained by the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer
6736071 all security service staff have an awareness of the human rights act 1998 and are fully committed to complying with the requirements of the law when working in the uk and overseas
6736072 do not participate in solicit encourage or condone the use of torture or inhumane or degrading treatment
6736073 to the extent of making it clear to mohamed that the united kingdom government would not help him unless he cooperated fully with the united states authorities

6736176 ada sekelompok orang yang multazim dan berjenggot di negeri kami mereka menyelisihi kami dalam sebagian perkara contohnya puasa romadhon
6736177 wajib mereka berpuasa bersama kaum manusia dan sholat ied bersama kaum muslimin di negeri mereka berdasarkan sabda nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
6736178 berpuasalah kalian karena melihat hilal dan berbukalah berhari raya karena melihatnya
6736179 waktu puasa pada hari mereka berpuasa dan berbuka berhari raya pada hari mereka berbuka berhari raya dan berkurban pada hari mereka berkurban
6736180 kami mendengar dari siaran radio berita permulaan masuknya puasa di kerajaan saudi arabia di waktu kami tidak melihat adanya hilal di negeri sahil al aaj guinea mali dan senegal walaupun telah ada perhatian untuk melihat hilal
6736181 barang siapa diantara kalian yang hadir di negeri tempat tinggalnya di bulan itu maka hendaklah ia berpuasa pada bulan itu
6736182 berpuasalah kalian karena melihat hilal dan berbukalah berhari raya karena melihatnya
6736183 tatkala orang orang dahulu dari kalangan para ahli fiqhi berselisih di dalam masalah ini setiap orang diantara mereka memiliki dalil maka jika telah nyata terlihatnya hilal baik melalui radio atau yang lainnya di selain tempatmu
6736184 boleh menggunakan alat alat pengintai teropong untuk melihat hilal namun
6736185 barang siapa diantara kalian yang hadir di negeri tempat tinggalnya di bulan itu maka hendaklah ia berpuasa pada bulan itu
6736186 mereka bertanya kepadamu tentang bulan sabit hilal itu maka katakanlah
6736187 berpuasalah kalian karena melihat hilal dan berbukalah berhari raya karena melihatnya jika ada mendung di atas kalian maka sempurnakanlah jumlah syaban 30 hari
6736188 bagaimana pandangan islam tentang perbedaan hari raya kaum muslimin iedul fithri dan iedul adhha di samping itu telah diketahui bahwa hal itu bisa mengantarkan kepada pelaksanaan puasa pada hari yang haram puasa padanya yaitu hari ied mengantarkan kepada pelaksanaan buka puasa hari raya pada hari yang masih wajib berpuasa di dalamnya kami mengharapkan jawaban yang memuaskan dalam masalah penting ini agar menjadi hujjah di sisi allah
6736189 jika mereka berselisih dalam perkara yang ada diantara mereka maka mereka harus berpegang dengan keputusan penguasa di negara mereka jika penguasanya adalah muslim karena keputusan penguasa ini akan menghilangkan khilaf dan mengharuskan ummat untuk mengamalkannnya jika penguasa bukan muslim maka mereka harus memegang keputusan mejelis islamic centre di negeri mereka demi menjaga persatuan dalam puasa mereka di bulan romadhon dan pelaksanaan sholat ied di negeri mereka
6736190 sampai nanti negeri negeri islam bisa bersatu di atas hal itu puasa amp hari raya ed maka sesungguhnya sekarang

6736344 after eight years at the side of u s senate she is clear eyed both about the demands of the globes toughest job and about using the power that comes with it she would try to lead by doing
6736345 her celebrity status notwithstanding clinton is at heart a worker in the trenches she has an encyclopedic knowledge of the issues and her success in the senate on behalf of new yorkers attests to both relentless attention to detail and skill at working the levers of power

6736354 gold sales are not a suitable way to sustainably consolidate the public accounts
6736355 national gold reserves have a confidence and stability building function for the single currency in a monetary union this function has become even more important given the geopolitical situation and the risks present in financial market developments

6736360 now there is blogging and comments readers may take 30 seconds to post a comment on a story or blog item that a writer dashed off in a minute on the globe website our slogan is join the conversation but in the blogosphere what follows isnt usually a conversation but a brief ungrammatical shouting match you can have more pensive chats in a bar fight and journalism wasnt meant to be a conversation anyway it was maybe a monologue at its most democratic a carefully constructed dialogue if readers didnt like or agree with the monologues in paper a they bought paper b what was most important about their opinions was that they thought enough to spend the coin
6736361 it is not true that anyone can write it is not true that anyone can write on deadline it is not true that anyone can do an interview it is not true that anyone can edit themselves and sort wheat from chaff it is not true that even great productive writers like the globes jim christie or ms dimanno or mr farber can hit a home run every time they sit before the laptop but the odds of them doing it are greatly increased if they havent already filed 1 200 words to the web shot a video done a podcast and blogged ferociously all day long most important michael farber is right we all have a limited number of things to say informed opinions funny lines quirky observations we have only so many words in us do we really want to spend them on something as ephemeral as a blog
6736362 im talking about players who are different animals to when i was a player theyve had opportunities to go to clubs particularly on loan and were reluctant to do it
6736363 footballers are changing these days some dont love the game as much as they should do if you love football you want to play
6736364 it doesnt annoy me but its a sad reflection on the people themselves one or two have had opportunities in the last few weeks to go to very good clubs at a very good level just to get games theres no hidden agenda they said no
6736365 footballers are a strange breed these days trust me i thought i was strange
6736366 some professionals have no intention of moving anywhere theres one or two of those at every club they are going nowhere unless real madrid came in for them
6736367 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011
6736368 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6736369 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6736370 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6736371 the number of us military bases would depend on the size and the needs of the troops
6736372 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
6736373 the us has gone very far in this agreement it is a very advanced agreement

6736384 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6736385 so far everything that has been received demonstrates we have no problem for the eligibility of the competitors
6736386 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6736387 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6736388 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6736389 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6736390 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here

6736392 if we see that banks have become very dependent on central banks then we must encourage them to tap other sources of funding
6736393 but there must be a limit to how long you can do this
6736394 they should strengthen their own backstops because of their central position in the economy
6736395 it may take some time before the economy is back on track
6736396 if a bank lends excessively central banks and regulators will see that

6736402 hay que conquistar a la afici n ganando t tulos
6736403 nosotros somos los primeros que no estamos nada confiados creo que ser un partido dif cil a pesar de afrontarlo con un buen resultado de la ida confiamos en que todo salga bien pero no ser f cil ganar al wisla
6736404 ello implica que tengamos que estar muy concentrados durante los 90 minutos m s incluso que antes porque en cualquier momento tienes que hacer una salida a muchos metros del rea esto comporta un cierto riesgo pero que creo que saldr muy bien
6736405 y el reto es conquistar de nuevo a la afici n ganando t tulos
6736406 la base del f tbol es divertirse porque no deja de ser un juego pero yo lo que deseo es ganar como sea me da igual si me lo paso bien o no en este club lo que vale es ganar

6736418 the slightest mishap causes great tailbacks and it can be a real nightmare if you are stuck between junctions
6736419 on the m25 we have introduced a controlled motorway where if we see traffic building up we reduce the speed limit this improves traffic flow and peoples journey times

6736421 people dont consume as much calcium as nutritionists would like and one reason for this is that foods high in calcium dont taste good to many people

6736423 we cant ban a folk belief but we hope to change how it is practised to ease pollution and eventually to phase the habit out
6736424 mean average plasma total homocysteine concentration was reduced by 30 percent after 1 year of treatment in the groups receiving folic acid and vitamin b12
6736425 we found a numerically lower incidence of stroke and higher incidence of cancer in the groups receiving folic acid but these observations were not statistically significant
6736426 our findings do not support the use of b vitamins as secondary prevention in patients with coronary artery disease
6736427 although smoking is the overwhelming cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd only 20 percent of smokers develop the disease
6736428 our findings suggest that mycoplasma pneumoniae mp infection may be one of the co factors that lead to copd and other diseases among smokers
6736429 without it all smokers would suffer significantly more lung damage
6736430 the mycoplasma infection blocked the lungs protective response to tobacco smoke by lowering levels of the enzyme that normally recycles oxidized glutathione back into its protective reduced form
6736431 this resulted in severe oxidative stress and increased tissue damage as measured by oxidized dna

6736436 this is a major breakthrough for older patients who have a worn out failing aortic valve and too many other medical problems to make conventional surgery a good option

6736438 our results appear to demonstrate that vigabatrin induced satiety in these animals
6736439 given the growing obesity epidemic we felt that examining vigabatrins therapeutic efficacy for obesity was particularly relevant
6736440 struggle with stage fright and sensitivities about appearing too forward pushy or intrusive
6736441 traditionally women feel that if they work hard and theyre loyal they will be recognised and it doesnt work that way
6736442 whats becoming quite apparent is that the way you actually have an impact on health development and poverty alleviation is when people adopt certain behaviours

6736445 my mother in law went to the field to work and suddenly fainted we took her to the doctor but he could not diagnose the problem then we brought her here where she has been diagnosed with leptospirosis
6736446 people think that in countries so bright so rich they dont have this kind of problem
6736447 the situation is not widely known among politicians in brussels
6736448 in some schools in the rural areas children dont want to go to the toilets because they are too dirty
6736449 this leads to diseases like hepatitis a and blue baby disease which is due to a high level of nitrates in drinking water
6736450 its taboo they are ashamed to talk about toilets and they dont really know how bad the situation is in their poorest areas
6736451 corruption is everywhere in bulgaria and blocks the money that should go to the poorest people in the rural areas
6736452 we have been waiting for this moment for 15 years

6736466 after five years in the lesbian community im starting to regret coming out of the closet since i was a little girl ive always fantasized about beautiful feminine women but i must say that i am very disappointed most feminine women i meet are either straight or bisexual and most lesbians i meet are masculine and unattractive im telling myself whats the use of having left a man to be with a bunch of women who look act and smell like men why dont i have access to beautiful feminine lesbians where can i meet them if they exist im convinced that there would be much more lesbians if the community was filled with beautiful women and not mullet sporting flannel wearing chain smoking dykes

6736493 we have asked the gymnastics federation to look into what have been a number questions and apparent discrepancies on this case
6736494 the eligibility of the athletes has already been investigated and authorized by the international federation and if they hadnt been cleared they wouldnt have participated in the games
6736495 according to online sports registration lists in china half the team he kexin yang yilin jiang yuyuan would be under age
6736496 our athletes participating in these games all conform to the age regulations of the olympics
6736497 asians have different figures than people from the west so thats what caused their suspicion
6736498 you couldnt distinguish that there was an aircraft there apart from the remains of the tail
6736499 if you didnt know it you wouldnt have been able to say there was a plane
6736500 one of them seems to be a little bit damaged but investigators are confident they could use the information
6736501 but we have to wait for the downloading and the analysis
6736502 the heating problem was treated and corrected by spanair maintenance personnel
6736503 the fault was isolated and the aircraft was dispatched for flight
6736504 we have reviewed the details on this faulty situation with the inspectors of our civil aviation authority and we all come to the conclusion that there was nothing abnormal in this resolution of that problem
6736505 weibliche diven warum werden sie so von schwulen m nnern okkupiert und als vorbild genommen
6736506 we expect that in the long run this project will not only improve the cultural relationship between india and all african countries but it will also help the growth of trade and commerce and industry between india and africa
6736507 this project is important for india because it will also help india to catch up with china which is wooing africa with lots of aid projects and other support in return for resources
6736508 given the long standing historical and cultural ties there is a renewed economic engagement between india and africa that is special in many respects
6736509 both india and africa have discovered a new economic synergy between each other and that has given rise to the need for a more energetic marketing of new business opportunities emerging in the african continent
6736510 even if indian companies may have been a little late in tapping the african market because we have been looking to the west more and more indian companies now are going to africa to find new opportunities
6736511 and indian companies are investing in areas where there is long term demand and in areas where they can grow
6736512 however the changes taking place in the global economic landscape have led to a shift in focus for the indian companies and they are now looking away from the west toward other regions and very intently at africa
6736513 it is widely perceived in india today that economic cooperation with africa which can be undertaken at both bilateral and multilateral levels opens a gateway to huge opportunities for both sides
6736514 india shares a different cultural and historical linkage with the continent that is well understood
6736515 our edge over china will be in impartment of appropriate training toward capacity building and language on a long term perspective this is what can eventually sustain relationships in the long run
6736516 no matter what it is ultimately africa that decides who its partners will be it can be india and china and any other

6736568 dat komt vooral door de stijgende brandstofprijzen en het steeds groter wordende bewustzijn bij de mensen

6736589 interpreting prophesies in scripture of the time and date that the anti christ will reign on earth has proven to be difficult
6736590 because there is so much evil in the world right now more that i have ever seen
6736591 this false religious man is waiting for the right time to step forth and convince everyone that he is indeed christ
6736592 it totally depends on how you interpret the book of revelation people will believe what they want though
6736593 no one will know until this anti christ shows his true colors anyway i know that some people think that president bush is the anti christ
6736594 there has always been evil and today is no different than the rest of history also there are no signs and no person that resembles the anti christ at this time
6736595 the anti christ is supposed to come after the rapture
6736596 he will appear in the seven years of tribulation and that time has not come yet to my knowledge
6736597 can actually prevent these infections and the cervical abnormalities that require more invasive interventions
6736598 the crux of it is that we know how to prevent cervical cancer
6736599 one of the key questions is whether this huge outlay of money for the vaccine is a better strategy than reaching out to the women who arent getting pap tests and follow ups
6736600 the cdc and fda checked out these reports very carefully
6736601 and weve done calculations for the number of cases reported and the number of cases that youd find in the general population and we have not found an increase
6736602 while the vaccine will improve the health of american women its real benefit is in the developing world and no matter what pap screening shouldnt be neglected thats still our best safety net
6736603 thanks teacher and while i am writing you i want to mention that one of the reasons i sometimes dont write back is that i cant find the article anymore
6736604 these two books are much more insightful and informative than thomas friedmans tomes representing globalization in cryptic terms
6736605 over all im optimistic but i feel that were walking the knives edge here
6736606 bill yes i have come to think of china that way
6736607 kevin i agree with teacher that bullying is not working for russia just because they are invading and getting away with it for the moment they are turning the whole world against them for their overreaction
6736608 teacher i agree with you the world is fraught with danger and it is going to stay that way yet the positive is there and i dont think it gets talked about enough and i do think in the long term that is the trend
6736609 dellasumbrella i thought about what you are saying tonight watching mccain and obama at saddleback church
6736610 im gonna keep quiet right now but i think you are wrong for a number of reasons lets leave it at im eyore on this and your tigger
6736611 raven exactly and on most questions confronting us what to do in georgia is a perfect example or what we were arguing about on whether to drill or not
6736612 dogone it why are you making things so difficult for me mccains line was way over the top and the whole situation in that part of the world shows how impotent threats do more harm than good
6736613 bill and freeport yes these things are all true more or less anyway but the remarkable thing is the progress bringing 400 million and even if it is only 300 million people out of poverty over 30 years is an historical first and yes there are 600 million or more to go
6736614 nb i hope everyone is out reading those books and not hooked into corsi do something to stir more comment like some excessive exuberance about globalization
6736615 my eyes are always bigger than my stomach when it comes to books i have a house full of books that i barely get started before i go on to the next but im interested in looking at zakarias
6736616 its better to be more thoughtful and recognize that too often it is easier politically to just give a specific answer when in fact life is full of uncertainties and doubts and new situations arise all the time
6736617 nb the critical driving forces behind the global economic growth which i find the absence in this discussion ironic was the abandonment of socialist economies exactly the opposite of what obama has in mind
6736618 evolution is a theory and one that conflicts with common sense
6736619 it is a scientific theory and should not be taught in the classroom as though it were a fact
6736620 only if it is presented with alternative theories such as intelligent design
6736621 if evolution is taught then the bible should be taught as well one freedom of speech should give way to another
6736622 as a theory but not as a fact because it has not been proven so
6736623 i believe in god and in evolution god put evolution in his plan so the world and life can evolve and survive the many changes and cycles that occur
6736624 christians are taught to think and discern for themselves therefore students should be presented with all the theories
6736625 it depends on which way it is taught as a theory or a fact
6736626 we have the freedom in this country to teach whatever the citizens vote for we should let the people in this country decide and the majority will rule
6736627 im not sure if the evolution theory leaves out god or not if it leaves out god then i say no if it includes god in the original design then i say yes
6736628 the bible provides the signs that christians are to notice when the end is near
6736629 the signs are all there if you read the bible it is indisputable
6736630 because of the signs that we are experiencing like false prophets wars diseases we are in the end times
6736631 it scares me to think how god destroyed sodom and gomorrah and yet how immorality has taken over this country there seems to be no shame in this area
6736632 we as christians just live the best we can and should not concern ourselves with the future
6736633 it may seem like it is close to the end but only god knows for sure and he is the only one who can end this earth age
6736634 do not know the bible well enough to say whether or not we are living in the end times
6736635 world without end isnt that what the bible says there have been plenty of other times in history when people thought the world would end remember y2k
6736636 anyone who would be so bold to say we are is a non believer or a cult
6736637 political issues should be issues that affect our citizens abortion is something that affects our citizens
6736638 abortion is murder and the government has every right to make laws to stop it
6736639 abortion is a justice issue politics without a moral fabric aborts true justice
6736640 we say a person is still alive when their brain has no activity and they cannot live without a machine but that a child isnt really a child until it is out of the womb and capable of breathing on its own
6736641 the separation of church and state should be upheld in all religious matters
6736642 sometimes there are circumstances in which an abortion would be the right choice such as proof of a severely deformed baby or in the cases of rape and incest
6736643 god has given us the free will to make our own decisions when it comes to choosing good or evil the government should extend the rights of free will to the people by not interfering only god can judge us for our actions
6736644 i am not sure about the laws of this nation and how far the government can interfere with the choices of the people
6736645 i think it really depends on the circumstances and the timing of the pregnancy i definitely think that the government should limit abortions to extreme cases
6736646 abortion shouldnt be an issue it should be illegal end of discussion
6736647 under extenuating circumstances and only if it is needed for food or gas
6736648 as long as you pay it back and as long as you have the means to pay it back within a reasonable period of time
6736649 only if it is from a trustworthy source check the bbb to make sure they are reputable
6736650 christians must learn to live within their means sometimes not having enough money for much needed items will give god a chance to prove to you that he takes care of his children just like the birds in the air and the lilies in the field
6736651 those places charge an unethical amount of interest interest charges on cash advances sometimes exceed twenty percent per month no christian should ever put their trust and faith in a cash advance business instead it should be placed in god
6736652 who is it ethical or not ethical for the borrower or the lender
6736653 a christian who uses these services will find out soon enough the consequences that they usually bring unless you can pay them back right away i dont think it is a good idea
6736654 christmas is about celebrating the birth of our lord and savior jesus christ not santa claus
6736655 the belief in santa claus is a tradition and nothing more it has nothing to do with a christians belief in christ and is not wrong
6736656 jesus came to break the shackles of the law and to give us freedom he knows the motivations of our heart
6736657 as long as you explain to your children the real reason for the season and dont lie to your kids about santa actually coming down the chimney its okay
6736658 we should be celebrating the birth of jesus christ alone for the season not the gifts that a fictitious character will bring to a child down a chimney
6736659 celebrating santa is a pagan custom and it also starts the habit of lying to children if we want our children to trust us about the reality of christ then we shouldnt lie to them about santa claus
6736660 we celebrate both in our house the kids know the real reason for celebrating christmas but we add a little fun by bringing santa into the mix
6736661 santa claus came from the actions of st nicholas he was a christian saint who helped needy children by dropping presents off at their door step
6736662 the decision should be made by each individual family as long as they are not making a weaker christian stumble its fine
6736663 the bible states that all christians at some point in time will experience spiritual warfare
6736664 even jesus was tempted by satan in the bible if we are for god then we are against the devil and that creates a spiritual war
6736665 fighting the addiction of drugs and alcohol is considered spiritual warfare this is how the devil tempts us not to trust god
6736666 all christians experience the war between good and evil we will always experience it as long as we live on earth and have a human body
6736667 i have had dreams where i was wrestling with god just like in the bible
6736668 i havent because i do not have the holy spirit in me yet satan doesnt tempt me because i am already on his side
6736669 i have never participated in religion enough to experience it
6736670 the commercialization of the christmas season is evident by the fact that society now refers to it as the holiday season for fear of offending non christians
6736671 because presents and santa are the focal point and not christ anymore
6736672 when you look at the history of the tree you will know the answer
6736673 jesus wasnt even born in winter so obviously it is not about the momentous occasion of his birth
6736674 only if christians allow it a christian home can celebrate the true reason for the season
6736675 originally it is supposed to be christian hence the name christmas it is celebrated to honor and remember the birth of our lord and savior jesus christ just because we live in america and everyone has the right to celebrate it their own way does not mean that the original roots have disseminated
6736676 knowing the difference and teaching our children about a fictitious santa claus and thanking god for the gift of christ can both be done in the home
6736677 it didnt start that way recently society has taken the christ out of christmas though
6736678 i am not sure because christians do celebrate jesus birth even though i dont think he was actually born on december 25th
6736679 churches today have the technology to be more exciting whereas in the past they were creatively limited
6736680 the singers and musicians are so talented and the music really gets me going for god
6736681 exciting things are happening on a daily basis our church just underwent a renovation we have a new childrens department with a full size gymnasium
6736682 the pastor is funny and down to earth he can really relate to us and we learn so much
6736683 worship is too modern now and not traditional enough especially for us older folks sometimes it seems as if the music team is only trying to entertain us instead of truly worshipping god
6736684 my church is too redundant a prayer three songs and a sermon there is no variation
6736685 i worship with reverence and humility where in scripture are we told that it should be exciting
6736686 how can it be a place the church is the people not the building was one persons response
6736687 sometimes yes and sometimes no usually the sermons about giving money are not exciting to the congregation or sermons that convict the heart
6736688 i havent been to church in awhile so i dont know
6736689 we live in a nation that allows the freedom to practice ones own religion which includes the christian action of in public places
6736690 public means for all who are citizens we live in america dont we it is our choice
6736691 people of other religions are allowed to pray during school hours why not christians
6736692 when you pray go to your room and close the door pray privately to your father who is with you your father sees what you do in private he will reward you matthew 6 6 ive never understood where or how christians got the idea that public prayer is what our lord wants
6736693 because its a public school and there are christians muslims buddhists agnostics and atheists and prayers should be said in the proper religious environment of ones choice not foisted on everyone
6736694 the separation of church and state is where we should look for the answer to this question
6736695 i am not sure what our countrys laws are on that issue
6736696 christians should not participate in public prayer the bible says so
6736697 appreciation for those who spread gods word to the nations of the world should be done in a biblical way
6736698 it doesnt say to celebrate st patricks day in the bible i only celebrate biblical holidays
6736699 only the catholic denomination celebrates the saints they even pray to them this is called idolatry
6736700 all people do on st patricks day is wear green and get drunk of course we shouldnt celebrate it
6736701 i am not sure if we should or not because i am not very familiar with what scripture says about celebrations of other people
6736702 it really depends on the way that you celebrate if you do it the modern way then no but if you sit down and reflect on the works of the saint and all he did in ireland then its okay
6736703 it depends on the history of the holiday its not in the bible so i would say its a conviction decision
6736704 the concept of war has been looked down upon since the beginning of time however there have been some instances in history where a war was necessary
6736705 it was a mistake because there was deception involved by our political leaders
6736706 war is always a mistake it doesnt matter the reason or the countries involved all life is sacred according to the holy scriptures
6736707 america has no business there as soon as we discovered that we were lied to we should have pulled our troops out this is all bushs fault i am glad his two terms are over
6736708 it was necessary because i am convinced that saddam hussein was hiding an arsenal of nuclear stuff and helping the terrorists it has moved from one radical country to another
6736709 a brutal and inhumane dictator was overthrown and has been executed for his crimes against his own people also the gospel is being spread in parts of the earth not previously accessible
6736710 a lot of good has come out sometimes war is necessary to change things although if there are other options available it would be better to pursue those
6736711 did not know enough about the situation to make an educated opinion
6736712 i keep hearing conflicting information from democrats and republicans about the causes and reasons for the war so i dont know what the truth is
6736713 we dont have the whole story only time will tell when we can look back and reflect once it is over
6736714 the state of the economy is in a constant state of fluctuation depending on the decisions of our leaders and citizens not only in our country but around the world
6736715 the unemployment rate is too high people need jobs to earn the money that they need to survive
6736716 every financial decision a christian makes should be a spiritual one and that includes whether or not to spend money on certain luxuries
6736717 every time we vote in a different candidate it takes years to rebalance the economy because of bi partisanship
6736718 the bible says that we should not worry about such fleeting things in life as money let the economy worry about itself and let us worry about our own attitudes of love towards one another
6736719 my treasures are laid up for me in heaven not here on earth
6736720 i am slightly concerned as i do think that the economy is going to change in the last days however i live in spain and because its part of the eu i believe we are in a different position than the usa at the moment
6736721 im definitely concerned but there is nothing i can do about it all of the plans that the politicians have put forth so far are a smoke screen to fool the american people
6736722 we should be able to protect ourselves as we are the consumers
6736723 i received the lord jesus christ as my savior when i was thirteen and was studying gods word then i obeyed his word by getting baptized
6736724 i found the answer from the bible then some time after that i was sitting in a church i had never been before there i heard god telling me that today is the day you need to get baptized
6736725 i was baptized as a baby and even though i didnt understand why then i do now so there is no reason to do it again
6736726 i have kids and have wanted to wait till we can be baptized as a family to me it is only an outward sign of the inward efforts
6736727 the lord jesus christ has always been in my life and i accept him as my lord and salvation
6736728 falling into a depression can happen when christians are viewing their lives from a different perspective than god
6736729 after my marriage fell apart and i was divorced unfortunately depression set in i was helped through the holy spirit and counseling i was okay for awhile until two years later life events took me through more challenges i again sought counseling and leaning on the lord
6736730 because i spent too much time on self and not enough time with the lord made wrong choices and reaped what i sowed all my own fault
6736731 it seemed like life was more so a punishment than a blessing
6736732 depression can be a form of sin apart from mental illness trust faith and assurance are promises that we as christians can claim if we allow god to work
6736733 look at the lilies of the field and the birds of the air they do not worry about food or clothing if our lord cares for them how much more will he care for you
6736734 depression is a word used too loosely today i am not sure if i have or not
6736735 i know i have been sad and down but im not sure if it was depression
6736736 theres no up side to being adversarial in these kind of deals youve just got to stay positive and youve got to focus on whos here and have trust and faith in the people that are working on getting everything done
6736737 no one gets 100 percent of what they would like to happen but me and my agent are happy
6736738 of course there were heated debates on the phone but no one attacked publicly i still feel the same way about this organization as i did last year the last game of the season
6736739 when youre talking about this kind of money a lot of people cant really understand why would you turn your back on a contract business is business
6736740 its more the conditioning factor of starting and stopping and getting in the huddle and doing all that we have plans to do some extra things with him even when were not practicing
6736741 taking a lot of hits you never know if you can jeopardize it
6736742 the only safe bet to not signing a new deal right away is staying out of harms way
6736743 some people dont agree and some people do agree and thats just what it boils down to during a holdout before i made the decision to hold out i took that into consideration

6736788 we are still not happy with this amount because we still feel that telecom has again wrongly billed us we have asked them to again review the amount
6736789 the decision reflected the firms view that it could continue with the same very high level of service administratively while operating on a slightly leaner basis
6736790 the positions involved were in information services real estate and facilities hr and finance
6736791 that would never happen we would not let it be interpreted that way
6736792 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

6736796 it has to be concern when a u s presidential candidate whose platform is nothing more than change we can believe in is supported by orchestrated chants of yes we can his background and public performance such as it is strongly suggests that the change he has in mind is nothing less than a transformation to socialism for the united states whats worse is his apparent intention to change the united states from a sovereign nation to an obedient member of the united nations global neighborhood
6736797 there is no virtue in change when the change is certain to be toward a socialist economic system that embraces global governance change that moves away from capitalism free markets private property strong defense and absolute on the u s constitution is change that must be rejected
6736798 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection

6736803 what is odd about reno was the fact that wie could of sic flown over to england instead and tried to qualify for the ricoh womens british open 18 spots were open and the way wie was playing the odds were in her favor but she chose not to and basically wasted a week by going off to reno
6736804 she could play in europe they have two dozen events over the year but in most cases the average pure sic is under a 1 million dollars so first place pays just around 100 000 small under lpga standards
6736805 wie could play in some future sic tour events but those are really sparse in prize money
6736806 no matter what the lpga could really use a figure like wie the tour has a lot of dark clouds in sic the horizon first in tournaments not being able to get sponsors thus some are leaving the lpga on top of that its sic star base is also leaving
6736807 another problem that is hurting the lpga is winners from asia that dont have the appeal value that michelle wie has because of language barriers since the first of june asians sic have won seven of the ten events and this doesnt help drive the lpga bus in getting not only more fans interested but new sponsors and television networks
6736808 we just have to hope that wie her parents and anyone with influence ms bivens are you reading this will be able to bring this to light and help michelle through this tough time yes q school is a painful moment for anyone but in reality its a split second in time and even a failure would not be a drastic setback for wie who does have other options like being a student at stanford
6736809 the petrol prices were fixed after taking into account the real price of petrol from aug 1 to aug 21 as well as the fixing of 30 sen subsidy for both grades
6736810 it is the governments hope that the reduction in petrol and diesel prices will help alleviate the burden of consumers and reduce the pressure of inflation especially for the lower and middle income groups
6736811 the governments decision was also made based on current economic developments
6736812 if the market price is higher than rm2 70 per litre then the price will remain at rm2 70 per litre
6736813 at the end of the visit the performances of each council would be recorded evaluated and scored with a view to judging their vision and mission

6736816 el n mero necesario de las fuerzas de paz en la zona de seguridad fijada conforme a los principios del arreglo que rusia acata estricamente
6736817 hay dos borradores de resoluciones sobre la mesa y mi lectura es que el consejo no est en disposici n de respaldar a ninguno de los dos
6736818 los seis puntos sin clarificaciones nos hacen temer que se ponga al consejo en la posici n de respaldar algo que no se respeta
6736819 hasta el ltimo momento intentamos convencer a la parte georgiana de no tomar ese rumbo desde el principio dijimos que ese conflicto no puede resolverse por la fuerza
6736820 i remember looking at my right seeing a vehicle in the slip road
6736821 then i looked at the road and it was clear the next thing i saw the headlight and the grill in front of my windscreen and that was it
6736822 all i remember was the cars on the slip road but nothing more i definitely looked i would never cross the road if anything was coming
6736823 i would never risk my childrens lives i would never risk the children in the car
6736824 this is a very tragic collision mr scales has come from market harborough along that road
6736825 he approaches the junction and as he does so a ford ka motor vehicle comes across the front of his transit he cant avoid the collision

6736827 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defence site here in poland that will help us to deal with long range missiles from countries like iran or north korea
6736828 what the secretary general was referring to is fulminating about how youre going to attack poland because there are 10 interceptors aimed at long range threats of the future from countries like iran when youve been offered all kinds of measures to demonstrate
6736829 they russia must know that the united states would never permit an attack on the territory of an ally under article 5
6736830 russia in this case will have to react and not only through diplomatic protests
6736831 one of the instruments in an extremely dangerous bundle of american military projects involving the one sided development of a global missile shield system
6736832 while before it was unclear whether poland would go for it or not the czech opposition could object to the concept as a whole
6736833 after eight years at the side of u s senate she is clear eyed both about the demands of the globes toughest job and about using the power that comes with it she would try to lead by doing
6736834 her celebrity status notwithstanding clinton is at heart a worker in the trenches she has an encyclopedic knowledge of the issues and her success in the senate on behalf of new yorkers attests to both relentless attention to detail and skill at working the levers of power
6736835 i said what the heck is that and there was an alligator floating by
6736836 i took my flashlight and was like youve got to be kidding me a big old alligator swimming around here
6736837 this storm is going to be with us for a while
6736838 it needs to come and get gone so we can get back to what we were doing
6736839 im ready to get back to work this is insane itll drive you nuts being stuck like this
6736840 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6736841 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6736842 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6736843 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6736844 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6736845 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6736846 say no to drugs cigarettes and alcohol because in general they destroy your organism and your life and bring you to places where you would have never wanted to go and much less experience
6736847 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6736848 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6736849 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6736850 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6736851 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6736852 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6736853 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6736854 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6736855 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6736856 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6736857 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6736858 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6736859 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6736860 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6736861 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6736862 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6736863 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6736864 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6736865 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6736866 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6736867 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6736868 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6736869 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6736870 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6736871 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6736872 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6736873 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6736874 we issued a release saying that over 40 olympic athletes downloaded the album in an act of solidarity and thats what triggered it then everything got blocked
6736875 we are aware of the logon problems but we have no comment at the moment
6736876 it seems like suspending itunes is punishment for itunes but really it doesnt hurt itunes it hurts us
6736877 some in beijing did download and i think thats what spooked the chinese government
6736878 theyre incredibly supportive people they wouldnt do anything like that
6736879 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6736880 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6736881 evidently less than 0 014 per cent less than a quarter of a per cent of nigerias estimated 140 million are under consideration
6736882 in general the economy has been highly inflationary since the last remuneration package came into effect in 1999 the rate of inflation was 6 6 per cent up to the end of 2005 the rate of inflation 17 9 per cent never went back to a single digit
6736883 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6736884 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6736885 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6736886 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6736887 the syntax for the built in remapping feature is originkey post subject capslock dreaded by all lousy typists
6736888 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6736889 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6736890 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6736891 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6736892 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6736893 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6736894 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6736895 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6736896 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6736897 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6736898 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6736899 we are not confident that the technical and commercial evaluation process in the short listing of the potential buyers guarantees the selection of the most competent hands to effectively manage the company and thus protect the interest of the employers including our members who have spent most of their productive years in the service of chevron oil nigeria plc we are worried about the focus being given to potential buyers that bid in excess of 300 per cent over and above the floor trading price of 202 naira is alarming pengassan as legitimate employees representative finds this very disturbing as this clearly implies that the potential buyers are going to incur the incredible bank charges and other related cost of capital to service the loans used to acquire the company this means that the profitability of the company cannot be sustained amongst its peers within the industry which will ultimately impair the companys competitiveness and market shares thereby jeopardising the interest of the employees including our members of the company we have observed that some of the potential buyers do not have the organisational structure to manage the current calibre of employees and to also support the already existing best practice corporate governance on which the chevron oil nigeria plc workers union prides itself locally and internationally
6736900 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6736901 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6736902 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6736903 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6736904 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6736905 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6736906 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6736907 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6736908 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6736909 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6736910 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6736911 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6736912 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6736913 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6736914 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6736915 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6736916 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6736917 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6736918 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6736919 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6736920 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6736921 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6736922 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6736923 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6736924 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6736925 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6736926 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6736927 who are open to doing something on the production side
6736928 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6736929 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6736930 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6736931 the ioc reserves the right to take sanctions or measures in relation to the athletes coach sergii blonskyi
6736932 we have rules in our country that we abide by we dont bring anybody who cheated previously so why should any other country
6736933 playboy has always done classy portfolios so im sure if this was real its something that would be considered
6736934 had i claimed to have gotten somewhere wed all be in trouble
6736935 because it already did this is how it turned out
6736936 after extensive discussions and frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy
6736937 we respect the right of the pakistan cricket board to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible
6736938 this was a difficult decision but it was the right one there is nothing more important than the safety of our national team
6736939 we appreciate all the efforts of the icc task team the pakistan cricket board the pakistan authorities and the security consultants
6736940 the players are naturally disappointed for their fans and the people of pakistan that they will not have a chance to see them in action in that country in september

6737038 because of a malicious politically motivated act of charles schumer our lives have been shattered
6737039 his deliberate publication of what should have been a confidential letter to bank regulators was the direct cause of the failure of indymac bank
6737040 could face a failure if prescriptive measures are not taken quickly
6737041 when charles keating caused the failure of a bank he went to jail
6737042 all the information in senator schumers letter was true and publicly available
6737043 while we certainly empathize with the plight of the employees their ire is better directed at the management of indymac who failed their customers their employees and the public at large
6737044 een menselijk wezen vormt een deel van het geheel dat door ons het universum wordt genoemd de mens ervaart zichzelf zijn gedachten en gevoelens als iets dat van de rest is afgescheiden dit is een soort optisch bedrog van zijn bewustzijn deze waan vormt een gevangenis voor ons het beperkt ons tot onze persoonlijke verlangens en tot affectie voor een paar mensen die ons het meest nabij zijn het is onze taak onszelf uit deze gevangenis te bevrijden door de kring van ons mededogen te vergroten en alle levende wezens en de gehele natuur in haar schoonheid te omhelzen

6737057 pennsylvania voters are clearly fed up with the legislature say both parties are responsible for corruption even though only democrats were indicted in bonusgate and want house majority leader bill deweese to step down for his role in the scandal
6737058 they are looking to gov ed rendell to convene a special session to handle corruption but have no faith that lawmakers can clean their own house
6737059 my feeling is after all thats gone on bill has become a tremendous distraction he said if he became a distraction hed step down
6737060 i wont allow his comments or anything else to distract me from these two important objectives
6737061 the fact is that the abuses outlined in the presentments occurred on bills watch and as such he will always be a symbol of a broken system
6737062 as the democratic leader he should take responsibility and resign his leadership post
6737063 distraught since he was named in the grand jurys presentment in july and i believe that his actions are motivated at least in part by undue concern about his own exposure
6737064 bill is wrong on the facts and the merits and it doesnt change one reason why he needs to resign he can attack me all he wants i figured he would its what the wounded do but it doesnt change the fact that he needs to resign as leader
6737065 without performing any work in return for the benefit of the people of pennsylvania

6737086 bershaumlah berdasarkan ruyatul hilal dan berhari rayalah berdasarkan ruyatul hilal jika terhalangi oleh mendung atau semisalnya maka genapkanlah bilangannya menjadi 30 hari
6737087 dan berpengang tegulah dengan tali allah al quran dan as sunnah dan janganlah kalian bercerai berai
6737088 ash shaum ramadhan itu pada hari kalian semua bershaum iedul fithri itu pada hari kalian semua ber iedul fithri dan iedul adha itu juga pada hari kalian semua ber iedul adha
6737089 an nahr iedul adha itu adalah pada hari kaum muslimin ber iedul adha dan iedul fithri pada hari kaum muslimin ber iedul fithri
6737090 shaum itu dilakukan bersama imam dan jamaah baik dalam keadaan langit itu cerah ataupun mendung
6737091 beberapa ulama menafsirkan makna hadits ini yaitu bahwa penentuan shaum dan iedul fithri bersama dengan jamaah atau mayoritas kaum muslimin
6737092 tetapi saya berpendapat bahwa setiap kaum muslimin menjalankan shaum ramadhan bersama pemerintahnya masing masing dan tidak mengikuti pendapatnya sendiri sendiri
6737093 anda mengingkari khalifah utsman shalat di mina 4 rakaat yang seharusnya 2 rakaat namun anda tetap shalat dibelakangnya 4 rakaat

6737095 dia allah telah mensyariatkan bagi kamu tentang agama sebagaimana yang telah diwasiatkan nya kepada nuh dan apa yang telah kami wahyukan kepadamu dan yang telah kami wasiatkan kepada ibrahim musa dan isa yaitu tegakkanlah agama dan janganlah kalian bercerai berai tentangnya
6737096 maka berpegang teguhlah kalian semuanya dengan tali allah dan janganlah kalian bercerai berai
6737097 dan janganlah kalian menyerupai orang orang yang bercerai berai dan berselisih sesudah datang keterangan yang jelas pada mereka mereka itulah orang orang yang mendapat siksaan yang pedih
6737098 bila seorang muslim bersaksi kepada pemerintah waliyul amr bahwa dia telah melihat hilal ramadhan namun tidak diterima persaksiannya hal ini merupakan perkara yang masih diperbincangkan dikalangan para ulama
6737099 ashaum itu pada hari kalian semua bershaum dan iedul fithri itu pada hari kalian ber iedul fithri dan iedul adha itu pada hari kalian ber iedul adha

6737157 first remploy frontline develops and manufactures world class flotation jackets ideally suited for champions like the journeymaker 5 and the waters in which they were racing second chris and his team are helping the uks many disabled children through enriching life experiences one of remploys precepts for helping disabled adults via employment opportunities
6737158 we were confident in our skills as experienced sailors and competitors but we knew we would need some excellent kit on board to help give us a leading edge
6737159 having a life jacket around me from our sister company remploy frontline made me feel safe and secure because i know what level of dedicated workmanship and quality went into producing this dependable deep water life jacket
6737160 we completed the challenge with the second fastest time ever
6737161 we beat the boats team with the previous record and they even brought in two top uk professional ultra endurance runners this year for the footrace part of the challenge
6737162 as time goes on there are always new needs for the trust to keep it going the need for more funding to continue to exist so that more disabled children across britain can have more enriched lives the trust gives kids an opportunity to do things and accomplish physical feats that they normally could not the trust like remploy helps encourage people with disabilities who are too often told what they cannot do instead of shown what they can do
6737163 although the workforce is primarily disabled we have some of the most highly skilled and motivated manufacturing experts in the world
6737164 we felt it was a sound business decision to encourage the match as it helped us to illustrate the importance of the relationship foster an attitude of business collaboration and fortify the bond between the two cities this is crucial for our enterprise and others like us in the uk or the us it means that we can do anything together sell uk made cbrn suits throughout america or play against each other in a friendly rugby match
6737165 the inaugural mayors cup challenge match was a resounding success regardless of the final score of the match we had a fabulous experience in our sister city of dundee and a very successful trip on behalf of both alexandrias rugby team and its business community we feel that remploy frontlines support of alexandria rugby and the twinned cities programme will prove to be just as beneficial to our hometown as it is for dundee we look forward to building on what weve started over the years to come
6737166 remploy frontline is very proud to have been a part of this unique twinned city event we hope that our involvement in this programme encourages more businesses and organisations in both cities to look more closely at ways they can support the business and cultural exchanges based on remploy frontlines mission it would be great if alexandria and dundee can create more opportunities for otherwise disabled people and help further enrich their lives
6737167 although the workforce is primarily disabled we have some of the most highly skilled and motivated manufacturing experts in the world

6737171 this convention our largest ever demonstrated that young people care passionately about and propose solutions to the issues that ultimately affect us all education fair pay and climate change
6737172 we call on the government to introduce legislation to reduce the voting age to 16 and allow thousands more young people who want to exercise a right to vote to do so
6737173 the convention delegates were enthusiastic passionate and inspiring and the decision by the council to prioritise votes at 16 is a major boost to the campaign and to the coalition of other key organisations and political parties who already support it
6737174 the british youth council is an organisation led and run by young people elected to a board of trustees we support young people to have a voice and be heard
6737175 i believe the votes at 16 campaign is what byc is fundamentally about as were a youth organisation committed to giving more young people a voice

6737182 whilst the deadline has passed for miners to lodge claims there are still many claims awaiting settlement some of which may take up to two years before a successful conclusion is reached therefore the site is still critical for solicitors to continue to track the progress of any outstanding claims it is now updated by capita who administer the services for berr providing information such as requests for more health information for each miner progress on claims and the details of the claims settlements
6737183 the big challenge for the team here at wtg was that we were dealing with a service coming close to the end of its lifecycle we had to deal with end users of the site who were used to the way it works but were migrating from entering claims to their management through the process of settlement the fact that we are able to ensure that the servers and software are supported and maintained for the life of the project while ensuring that solicitors can still access the information for their clients means that we were able to deliver against objective and budget

6737211 companies should have a data classification policy in place so staff know what can be publicly disseminated and what needs to stay private
6737212 if in doubt about the sensitivity of a document always check you shouldnt take responsibility for what can and cannot be made public a lot of companies rely on employees best judgement but this is not a good idea
6737213 it means company sensitive information is now residing on a personal computer which may not have the same level of security as the company one
6737214 sending an email to anybody particularly over the internet is not secure its like sending information on a postcard if something sensitive has to be emailed it should be encrypted
6737215 you have to ask why a person has sensitive information on a laptop or usb key in the first place technology can help stop the problem but a lot of it is down to processes and people

6737257 in recent decades the doctrine of creation had almost disappeared from theology it was almost imperceptible
6737258 we are now aware of the damage that this has caused if we do not proclaim god in his full grandeur as creator and as redeemer we also diminish the value of the redemption
6737259 it is he the creator himself who did and can enter into history and operate in it precisely because he is the god of the whole and not only of a part if we recognize this it will obviously follow that the redemption being christian and simply christian faith also means responsibility always and everywhere with regard to creation
6737260 as long as the earth was seen as gods creation the task of subduing it was never intended as an order to enslave it but rather as the task of being guardians of creation and developing its gifts of actively collaborating in gods work ourselves in the evolution that he ordered in the world so that the gifts of creation might be appreciated rather than trampled upon and destroyed
6737261 the brutal consumption of creation begins where god is not where matter is henceforth only material for us where we ourselves are the ultimate demand where the whole is merely our property and we consume it for ourselves alone
6737262 and the wasting of creation begins when we no longer recognize any need superior to our own but see only ourselves
6737263 i think therefore that true and effective initiatives to prevent the waste and destruction of creation can be implemented and developed understood and lived only where creation is considered as beginning with god

6737281 these rat model tumors were developed from human glioblastoma tumor cells and closely mimic human tumors in growth patterns and response to therapy
6737282 the concept of targeting blood vessels that feed tumors as an approach to limit tumor growth is not a novel idea
6737283 however blocking the specific fatty acid described in this study is novel and holds great promise for use in humans
6737284 if survival time could be extended with a combination of surgical therapy and infusion with similar drugs this could be a significant treatment option

6737316 call on opep prenait 3 mb j en deux ans
6737317 des pays de lopep tels que larabie saoudite le nigeria et langola ont annonc quils ajouteront 10 mb j de capacit s nouvelles de production dici 2014 toutefois tous les pays de lopep ne sont pas capables de fournir le m me effort lindon sie liran et le venezuela par exemple vont voir leur capacit de production d cliner dautres comme le kowe t lirak et les emirats arabes unis ne pourront faire mieux que maintenir leur production dans le meilleur des cas donc au total lopep qui dispose officiellement de 75 des r serves plan taires ne peut pas d gager de capacit s de production suppl mentaires au cours de la prochaine d cennie
6737318 la hausse des prix de l nergie ne cr e pas de nouvelles opportunit s de production parce que les nouvelles ressources en p trole et en gaz naturel sont beaucoup plus difficiles trouver et d velopper
6737319 compagnies p troli res lagence internationale de l nergie et ladministration am ricaine qui ont cyniquement exag r les capacit s de production de lopep il sagissait dexercer une pression politique sur les pays de lopep afin de permettre aux compagnies internationales de simplanter sur leur territoire
6737320 qui ont laiss circuler des estimations sp culatives de leurs r serves ne reposant sur aucune analyse technique et dont les d clarations sur leurs r serves prouv es r pondent des d crets politiques
6737321 peu de pays de lopep sont pr ts le faire en particulier si cela revient r duire le montant de leurs r serves de p trole au lieu de les augmenter
6737322 la situation est analogue celle dun r servoir deau que lon pomperait plus vite quil ne se remplit
6737323 bien s r la sp culation est lorigine de certaines augmentations des prix du p trole
6737324 cependant lescalade logique des prix depuis 2002 indique aussi que les extractions de p trole sont fondamentalement limit es
6737325 plus vite nous r aliserons que les extractions de p trole ne peuvent augmenter ind finiment plus vite nous rechercherons des options nerg tiques alternatives et soutenables et nous viterons ainsi des folies tragiques telles que loccupation de lirak et dautres m saventures similaires
6737326 un nombre grandissant de capitaine de lindustrie p troli re endossent une id e longtemps consid r comme marginale le monde sapproche dune limite mat rielle du nombre de barils de p trole brut qui peuvent tre pomp s chaque jour certains pr disent que en d pit de la soif de p trole qui saccroit rapidement les producteurs pourraient atteindre ce plafond d s 2012 cette limite approximative dont deux responsables industriels ont r cemment plac 100 million de baril par jour est largement en dessous des projections de demande mondiale pour les prochaines d cades
6737327 a growing number of oil industry chieftains are endorsing an idea long deemed fringe the world is approaching a practical limit to the number of barrels of crude oil that can be pumped every day
6737328 100 millions de barils par jour est maintenant de mon point de vue un sc nario optimiste
6737329 nous avons t tous trop optimiste avec la g ologie pas en terme de r serves mais en terme de la mani re de d velopper ces r serves combien de temps cela prend et combien avons nous r ellement besoin
6737330 100 millions de barils par jour est difficile parceque dans les 100 nous avons d j int gr les quantit s additionnelles de lirak du v n zuela et du nig ria nous avons int gr des quantit s additionnelles de partout et nous savons aujourdhui que ces d veloppements ne sont pas en cours de r alisation
6737331 la demande va monter mais elle sera contrainte par la production je ne pense que nous irons plus loin que 100 millions de barils par jour et la raison est celle ci do est ce que tout ceci proviendra

6737336 sur la s curit nerg tique sans parler des prix juste les nombres il ne faut pas tre un grand expert en nergie ou quoi que ce soit ce sont juste des math matiques je peux vous dire que dans les sept huit prochaines ann es nous aurons besoin de mettre sur le march environ 37 5 millions de barils par jour pour deux raisons la premi re la croissance de la demande compte pour environ un tiers du total et les autres deux tiers cest pour le d clin des gisements existants quil faut bien compenser ce que nous avons fait est que nous avons regard tous les projets au sein des pays de lopep et non opep tous les pays producteurs du monde les 230 projets p troliers gisement par gisement pour savoir combien de p trole ils pourraient apporter au march pour les 5 7 prochaines ann es et ce sont des projets qui sont financi rement rentables si ils voient le jour en temps et en heure ils apporteront environ 25 millions de barils par jour par cons quent 37 5 million de barils par jour dun c t ce qui est n cessaire et ce que nous pr voyons est 25 million de barils par jour et cela dans le cas ou il ny a pas de retard pas d lais suppl mentaires dans les projets que tout arrive comme pr vu ce qui est tr s rare avec tout cela il manque 13 5 million de baril par jour
6737337 ec je pense que vous faites r f rence un graphique cest un taux moyen global de d clin de 3 7 par an est ce juste
6737338 mais si vous injectez de largent dans un gisement donn vous pouvez ralentir la nature du d clin
6737339 avec tout cela il manque 13 5 million de bail par jour
6737340 ec le manque de cette taille 13 5 mb j mergera dici combien de temps
6737341 quand vous dites tr s tr s haut prix quest ce que cela signifie cela signifie que les prix doivent tre assez haut pour toufer la demande quel prix va alors mettre l quilibre lapprovisionnement et la consommation
6737342 le probl me que nous avons avec la demande maintenant est le suivant il y a trois centres majeurs de croissance de consommation lheure actuelle la chine linde et le moyen orient quand vous regardez les chiffres des sept derniers trimestres 70 du pourcentage de croissance de la demande mondiale vient de la chine et de linde suivi par le moyen orient et dans ces trois r gions pour diff rentes raisons les prix du p trole nont pas deffet imm diat sur la demande la chine et linde pour deux raisons la premi re l conomie croit si fortement que leffet du prix est compl tement insignifiant compar leffet conomique leur conomie croit leur poches deviennent de plus en plus remplies et peut tre quune portion de richesse plus importante va de leur poches vers les d penses en p trole mais comme l conomie grandit fortement cela na pas grand effet la seconde raison est que sp cialement en chine et et inde il y a des subventions singificatives sur les prix des produits p troliers selon nos analyses au sein de ces deux pays chaque ann e 15 milliards de dollars vont des subventions aux produits p troliers qui filtrent leffet sur les consommateurs ensuite vient le moyen orient encore ici la hausse des prix dans ces pays na pas beaucoup deffet parceque leffet des rentr es dargent issues de la vente du p trole est bien plus important et en plus le prix des produits p troliers est tr s lourdement subventionn alors que la croissance de la demande ne vient plus des pays de locde o les forces du march agissent par cons quent il est vraiment difficile dimaginer m me avec des prix lev s comme cela que nous allons avoir un effet majeur sur la consommation donc la demande va continuer croitre et je pense si les gouvernements de locde de la chine et de linde laissent tout au march en termes de ralentissement de la demande ils feront une faute historique avec lajustement des prix la demande nous avons besoin de mesures de r gulation tels que des am liorations de l fficacit au sein des march s
6737343 dam liorations de l fficacit au sein des march s
6737344 ec quand le p trole se trouvait 110 en termes r els au d but des ann es 80 nous avions un tr s s rieuse r cession globale est ce quil y a un risque r el nouveau
6737345 fatih birol nous pensons que au sein des pays de lopep il y a assez de r serves
6737346 fb nous sommes plus optimiste a cause de leffet du prix et beaucoup de projets vont venir prochainement les sables bitumineux du canada qui est le plus important devrait atteindre 3 mb j le plus probablement dici 2015 ce qui correspond seulement 3 de la production mondiale ce qui est tr s faible aussi en d pit de ce que beaucoup de gens pensent je ne croit pas que le p trole non conventionnel remplacera un jour le moyen orient
6737347 nous sommes toujours dans un mode pleinement d magogique et d claratif devra t on attendre que des p nuries r elles et des queues se produisent pour faire quelque chose

6737374 nosotros somos los primeros que no estamos nada confiados creo que ser un partido dif cil a pesar de afrontarlo con un buen resultado de la ida confiamos en que todo salga bien pero no ser f cil ganar al wisla
6737375 a nivel de resultados las cosas han ido como dese bamos ahora lo que queremos es entrar en la champions ganando el partido que nos queda contra el wisla y despu s ya nos centraremos en el primer partido de liga

6737383 krijgen die ze onder meer kunnen gebruiken om in contact te komen met rechtenstudenten bij de lancering maken al meer dan zes advocatenkantoren gebruik van deze mogelijkheid
6737384 diverse grote advocatenkantoren hebben zich al bij ons aangesloten met een profiel ook studenten krijgen hun virtuele studiekamertje op bigbrain kunnen studenten maar ook advocaten stukken publiceren en op basis van de inhoud in discussie gaan zo kunnen studenten zich op basis van hun vermogen en interesse presenteren en geven kantoren ondertussen een goede kijk in de keuken door bijvoorbeeld actuele publicaties
6737385 voor bijna afgestudeerden is het soms erg moeilijk een goed beeld te vormen hoe het werkelijk is om bij een kantoor als het onze te komen werken
6737386 juist door intensief contact zie je dat het vaak pas mogelijk is een goed gefundeerde keuze te maken

6737399 its really hard to describe how low howry ended up
6737400 if you can imagine the standard bell curve where the high point is average and to the left is below average bob howry is so far to the left that we couldnt quite plot him on the curve
6737401 to put it in perspective the bell curve is usually used to show iq results with 100 being average and lower scores displaying on the left and become less and less likely as you go further left if this were an iq test bob howry would be so far to the left that he wouldnt just be classified as retarded hed be some kind of super hero level retarded
6737402 is bobby howry actually the best pitcher on the cubs new statistical analysis confirms that no he is not

6737410 i got to the page where the reference was made to a toffeenosed twit
6737411 on the next page the word changed i thought i was mistaken but i saw to my shock it had been repeated twice again
6737412 i am not a prude in fact i am quite broadminded but this is completely inappropriate for children they should not have to be subjected to trash and vulgarity i did not expect this from a well respected author and do not want my young niece to have to see this obscene slang

6737415 the print was in deplorable condition and even while giving full attention from only a few yards the dialogues between parbati and her husband were very difficult to follow
6737416 the sound has become inaudible and the film has become obscure the projectionists struggled to raise the volume to almost no effect still the dialogues could not be clearly heard
6737417 the only print of the 1934 film is preserved in a room of a rented house of bfa at mohammadpur in the capital at 26 degrees celsius when the international standard is 12 degrees celsius or less
6737418 mismanagement preservers apathy to carrying out duties the absence of training shortage of manpower inadequate budget and the absence of a permanent building have contributed over the years to bring the archives to this sorry state

6737426 we will listen to him but of course its not russia that must decide these things unilaterally we have a framework in the six point plan and the future developments are subject to further diplomatic efforts
6737427 our draft resolution is a reconfirmation of the six point agreement and theres no territorial integrity in the six principles
6737428 we believe the six principles are clear and already implemented
6737429 we have a presence of so called russian peacekeeping forces at key georgian choke points that will control economic life it will control humanitarian activities thats why clarifications are so important
6737430 for all practical purposes military to military co operation had really already been ended with the russians
6737431 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military co operation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6737432 i think what is happening right now is that russian has shown its force in georgia and it saw the weak reaction of the west
6737433 to say im pleased with the results is an understatement we were hoping for prices of up to 40 per cent lower than the current benchmark achieving around 50 per cent savings for the laptops is a phenomenal result this will really pave the way in helping our customers meet their savings targets
6737434 we have always been convinced of the potential for savings through collaboration and e auctions and are really pleased with these latest results the nine e auctions we have undertaken so far have realised total savings of 35 per cent which equates to 33 3m saved overall

6737436 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and treated accordingly
6737437 there is no clear evidence that positive or negative experiences can affect breast cancer risk emotional stress is highly subjective and is difficult to measure accurately
6737438 women in this study were interviewed after breast cancer was diagnosed when they may be more likely to recall feeling depression and anxiety the researchers also did not account for other factors known to affect breast cancer risk such as family history or weight
6737439 breast cancer is a complex disease and there is unlikely to be one single cause
6737440 it was outrageous to prosecute me while they can carry on clamping
6737441 i couldnt believe it he was sitting there next to my daughter holding a hammer looking at me my wife was screaming at them
6737442 she grabbed olivia and he jumped out of the car and i got into the drivers seat and started ramming backwards
6737443 the guy kept flagging the driver to get closer it was just a nightmare the kids were screaming it was horrible they wouldnt budge in the end i managed to ram free and drive off
6737444 i was just concentrating on olivia who was screaming and crying when i got around to the back i saw him holding the hammer up and said please dont hit my husband
6737445 we were clamped because they said my parking ticket was upside down but it wasnt it was lop sided
6737446 they followed me and terrified my wife and children they were wielding a hammer at me and my little girl but i am the one who ends up in court
6737447 imagine spending a day on the beach with a family who were hounded and hunted by two bully boys

6737463 lo que dicen las c maras es que no hubo ninguna explosi n durante el despegue

6737465 que se est n dando informaciones amarillas y malintencionadas sobre lo que es llanamente un accidente
6737466 se adoptaron todas las medidas de seguridad que se pudieron tomar
6737467 ya que no se puede olvidar que el piloto siempre es el primer interesado en la seguridad del veh culo que lidera puesto que va en primera fila del mismo

6737483 memang saya tanda tangan dan mengesahkan senat pada saat itu tetapi menurut mendiknas berkas pengangkatan itu tidak lengkap dan tidak sah sebagai senat maka harus dibentuk ulang

6737487 we are coming apart at the seams in every sense
6737488 nearly two months to have a pair of trousers mended which had been torn by a not completely screwed down screw on a jump seat meanwhile alitalia is back in the news with plans of new cuts they want to make but i have already made my cuts

6737490 there is a meal missing either it wasnt loaded or there are more passengers than we had booked
6737491 the undercarriage is nude without mudguards the plane can only fly if it doesnt rain we are fine until the end of september but only in the south nothing to put security at risk
6737492 if one is not in line with the norms and dictates alitalia does not take off
6737493 international statistics confirm that alitalia is one of the most secure airlines in the world
6737494 perhaps aviator az does not take into account the delicate situation in which we find ourselves
6737495 its just so easy to quick run in grab a few things and be out the door in 15 minutes
6737496 because of the smaller size of the store its easier for me to walk up and down the aisles
6737497 our son lives in henrietta and is looking forward to seeing what the new store looks like inside
6737498 i cant wait to see the expression on the faces of customers as we welcome them to their new store
6737499 up until now our stores used a wood burning oven that did not offer much flexibility in terms of efficiency
6737500 this new oven the second one weve installed in a store allows us to shut off parts of the oven that are not being used saving energy its also fun because customers can watch the ovens light up when they are in use
6737501 we have replaced less energy efficient forms of lighting with led lighting which produce less heat and high efficiency fluorescent fixtures
6737502 like all new wegmans stores this store uses environmentally friendly glycol in medium temperature refrigerated cases instead of regular refrigerant dramatically reducing carbon dioxide emissions
6737503 the old store has been my home for many years and i am definitely going to miss it but its going to be a lot of fun to start a new one

6737552 the israeli authorities deny it but with the cameras we can prove what happens and force them to do their jobs

6737571 the origins of handball are a subject of great debate one view is that it was invented in germany back in the late 19th century as an outdoor sport to keep soccer players fit during the summer months outdoor handball involved 11 players on each side and was played on a virtually fullsize turf soccer ground with soccer goals it was mainly played with soccer rules except it was played with the hands and kicking the ball was illegal rather than the other way round however there are records of handballstyle games going back to antiquity the sport was depicted on a tombstone carving in athens dated 600bc the first match of the modern era was officially recorded on 29 october 1917 in berlin germany outdoor handball had its only olympic games appearance in the xith olympiad 1936 berlin games the first international match recorded was played on 3 september 1925 with germany defeating austria 6 3

6737583 to make the conclusion that the finger is pointing to god is pretty far fetched it is pointing that way in order to direct people as to where to push the button

6737598 het was direct vanaf het begin de bedoeling om vijf speelbare klassen in diablo 3 op te nemen om meer vrijheid te hebben tijdens het ontwerp van het spel wilden we vijf compleet nieuwe klassen introduceren een van die nieuwe klassen leek steeds meer op de barbarian uit diablo waarop ik heb gezegd dat we het beestje dan maar gewoon bij zijn naam moeten noemen daardoor keert de barbarian dus terug in het spel hoewel we drie van de vijf klassen nog niet hebben aangekondigd staat voor ons vast welke dat zijn en daar zit de necromancer niet tussen we denken echter al voorzichtig na over een uitbreiding van diablo 3 en daar zou de necromancer best eens in terug kunnen keren
6737599 het isometrische camerastandpunt is kenmerkend voor diablo het hoort bij de serie we hebben nooit overwogen om een derde persoonperspectief te kiezen de isometrische camera heeft grote voordelen we willen dat diablo 3 er goed uitziet en dat de grafische pracht ook tot uiting komt op een middelmatige pc door een isometrische camera te gebruiken is dat mogelijk door de vaste camerapositie weten we zeker dat de speler nooit naar de horizon kan kijken buiten het kleine blikveld hoeven we daarom niets te renderen doordat alleen de directe omgeving in beeld is kunnen we die er heel gedetailleerd uit laten we kunnen al onze aandacht richten op wat vanuit de beperkte camerapositie zichtbaar is en omdat de camera niet kan bewegen hoeven we vaste voorwerpen niet eens een achterkant te geven
6737600 dat zijn er heel veel wat vooral opvalt is dat spelers het verschil tussen het inzetten van runes en van runic powers niet goed begrijpen het is ons opgevallen dat veel spelers de meter die de runic powers aangeeft niet eens hebben gezien dus daar gaan we zeker nog wat mee doen
6737601 dat is een bewuste keuze van ons vliegen met je eigen mount is natuurlijk erg leuk maar het is ook wat gemakkelijk met een flying mount worden sommige quests wel heel eenvoudig daarom kun je in northrend niet vliegen tot je level 77 hebt bereikt vanaf dan kun je een quest uitvoeren die je leert om in het nieuwe continent te vliegen op die manier willen we de speler dwingen om aan de slag te gaan met de quests die in de eerste zones van northrend worden gevonden

6737606 neither of us started well and we used to say we wanted to leave
6737607 we can laugh about it now because we have both reached 100 games
6737608 i am really pleased i have worked hard to achieve that and i would like to play many more games for united
6737609 it surprised me in fact i think it has come as a surprise to everyone
6737610 it is not often a player leaves one big club to go to another like arsenal or liverpool it does not tend to happen
6737611 but mikael did not play much last year and i think he just wanted to go somewhere where he would
6737612 he has been here a long time and he still deserves to play at the highest level
6737613 i dream of playing in the premier league chelsea have a great squad a great team and theyve made an offer thats great for both me and real madrid
6737614 i have nothing against my current team to whom im very grateful but at this point my goal is to leave here and i hope that everything will be resolved as soon as possible
6737615 i wanted to come to arsenal because the potential to win trophies is there and the fire is still in my heart
6737616 hopefully i can look forward to a fresh start without any injuries
6737617 i left united especially because i did not want to spend any more time on the bench after nine years
6737618 i did not want to spend an extra one just waiting for the testimonial to arrive that is not my mentality
6737619 i was looking at a new challenge and when someone like arsenal comes along you cannot say no
6737620 it will be natural to give some advice but i will not be focusing on that
6737621 the main thing is to be part of the team and perform well to show an example on and off the field
6737622 i would not have expected that but sir alex ferguson and i had a very good relationship that is why i stayed so long there because playing for him was a great honour
6737623 he listened to me and would not go against me so i am pleased
6737624 it is hard to leave because there are so many nice people there
6737625 but the fans will understand that as a player you leave
6737626 i was loyal to man united for nine years and will now be loyal to arsenal and perform as much as i can which is all that matters
6737627 la ilusi n es la regla general del universo la realidad no es m s que una excepci n

6737632 i think we can fight with the big clubs and achieve things i was pleased with the project sunderland had to offer
6737633 sunderland have big players a nice stadium big fans they have everything to achieve good things i hope to score a lot of goals and help sunderland to the top part of the table
6737634 im excited really i hope to be allowed to play on saturday and show what i can do show the club that they were right to trust me im fit im ready to go
6737635 spurs is a tough game but there is a lot of quality here i think we can surprise them
6737636 im hungry to do well here i hope to bring goals and energy to the side
6737637 when a club the size of sunderland comes in for you it is an easy decision
6737638 i have met niall quinn and roy keane two legends of the game and it inspires me
6737639 i cant wait to pull on the jersey im thrilled and excited the ambition of the club is huge it is a club on the up
6737640 ive not played that many games but i played 90 minutes on wednesday so that will help my fitness

6737668 when i did my first album i said that when i did a second i wanted gary to write for me i think he is a great songwriter one of britains best songwriters i love take that so it was always a dream of mine that hed write for me
6737669 he said it was fantastic i hope in future gary will play when i sing
6737670 when i was contacted by bryn about performing at the festival i said i would like whoever won the nancy role to sing in concert with me
6737671 i think its important that we help promote the people we choose to win i backed jodie really quietly for the whole time as i really believed in her when people see her do other things they will realise what a star she really is
6737672 bryn has asked me to be involved for a few years but because of filming ive never been able to
6737673 but this year i hadnt finalised my schedule for torchwood so i told them to make sure i could have time off to do it
6737674 torchwood has really reached out to audiences worldwide and the fact its moved up the channels on the bbc is incredible
6737675 we moved from cardiff bay to the beach i really love wales so its great to have the chance to play at a big festival here
6737676 i love the people and the place we decided to have our civil partnership in cardiff and the response we got from people was unbelievable our neighbours in sully are wonderful i feel at home here
6737677 we have a house in london because we still work in london but our main house is in wales
6737678 i never want to be pigeon holed im an entertainer whether im entertaining a teenage girl whos watching me judging on a tv show a young guy watching doctor who or a couple watching torchwood the fact i can diversify is great
6737679 ooh i dont know you will have to watch they are talking about it i would like to see a year hiatus before theres another one you need to put a pause on something when you have such a good thing going rather than flog it like a dead horse
6737680 it was the highest rated show on the bbc that evening ive had a huge response to people saying theyre more open minded now
6737681 teenagers have written to me and said theyre more comfortable with coming out now some were on the brink of suicide but changed their minds im really pleased with that
6737682 theres nothing wrong with who i am or being gay and i wanted people to see that there are always people who wont like me but all i ask is people respect me
6737683 this regulation is not about contraception its about abortion and conscience
6737684 this lack of knowledge of provider conscience law within the health professions can be detrimental to conscience and other rights particularly for individuals and entities with moral objections to abortion and other medical procedures
6737685 the proposed regulations and secretary leavitts public comments about them leave the door open as to whether institutions and individuals can deny access to contraception
6737686 while the rules are not identical to the draft proposal being circulated by hhs last month the agency interprets existing conscientious objection laws so broadly that it could result in women not receiving information they need to make informed healthcare decisions
6737687 it undermines the doctor patient relationship because women will now have to question whether their health care providers are giving them complete and unbiased information and the best care possible
6737688 t he issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers the department is still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
6737689 is the fear here that so many doctors will refuse that it will somehow make it difficult for a woman to get an abortion that hasnt happened but what if it did wouldnt that be an important and legitimate social statement

6737699 before i tell you what we found id like to tell you what we did not find
6737700 we did not find any evidence that explosives were used to bring the building down the collapse was also not due to fires from the substantial amount of diesel fuel stored in the buildings
6737701 no combination of debris damage fuel tank explosions and fires could inflict the kind of simultaneous damage to all the buildings columns required to make the building implode
6737702 the precision of such damage required to bring building 7 down into its footprint was especially great given the ratio of its height to its width and depth
6737703 anyone who has run a tight jar lid under water to help loosen it knows that the metal expands when it gets hot
6737704 heat also causes steel to lose strength and stiffness thermal expansion occurs at temperatures much lower than those required to reduce steel strength and stiffness
6737705 if you look at columns 79 80 and 81 three of the buildings central columns the floor area that theyre carrying is very large particularly column 79 which was carrying about 2000 sq ft of floor area
6737706 it was an interior column that failed followed by two more interior columns 80 and 81 then east to west so what youre seeing is an interior collapse then to the outside what youre getting is an impression of a controlled demolition but its not
6737707 we asked ourselves what is the minimum amount of charge we could use to bring the building down
6737708 and we found that even the smallest charge would release an extremely loud sound heard half a mile away
6737709 in order for the thermate reaction to melt steel to take place there has to be materials if you look at the amount needed at least 100 pounds for one column you need someone to get that amount in the building and place it and for the reaction to take place it is unlikely
6737710 longer beams can be subject to proportionally greater expansion effects
6737711 other tall buildings have burned for as long or longer in similar fires without collapsing when sprinklers either did not exist or were not functional so we knew from the beginning of our study that understanding what happened to building 7 on 9 11 would be difficult it did not fit any textbook description that you could readily point to and say yes thats why the building failed
6737712 in hindsight we knew that the building was evacuated but we didnt know that on that day
6737713 i am not surprised that there wasnt a lot of identifiable debris
6737714 but at the time we were concerned about terrorists who attacked our country and search and rescue i think the fact that they invesigators didnt collect wreckage was the least important activity that happened that day
6737715 we thought we might be able to do things much quicker and faster because of our tower experience
6737716 i think we underestimated the amount of effort that would be required to answer the questions that we raised
6737717 a typical fire simulation for a single floor of the building took up to two days with a state of the art cluster of linux computers we had computer programs that took six to eight months to get a correct run and we wanted to make sure we got this right and three years is not an unusual length of time
6737718 we didnt have the insight that thermal expansion could have happened until early last year
6737719 simple straightforward elegant and going along with what was observed i would say that the findings we have are incredibly conclusive that fire is why wtc 7 collapsed

6737730 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011
6737731 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6737732 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6737733 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6737734 the number of us military bases would depend on the size and the needs of the troops
6737735 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
6737736 the us has gone very far in this agreement it is a very advanced agreement
6737737 its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification or anything like that

6737740 block box file the official flight data recorded from flight 77 its a digital record of everything that happened on that flight from take off additionally altitude and position are confirmed by the beacon at nearby reagan national airport
6737741 after take off flight 77 never went below 273 ft
6737742 its physically impossible for the plane flight 77 to have caused the damage to the building pentagon
6737743 during the time that the airplane was coming into the pentagon there was a young man who would come in and say to the vice president the plane is 50 miles out the plane is 30 miles out
6737744 of course the orders still stand have you heard anything to the contrary former transportation secretary norman mineta 911 commission hearing
6737745 where the idea of a work contributes almost nothing to the democratic dialogue and it is only its expression which is meaningful
6737746 its easy to imagine an infinite number of situations where the government might legitimately give out false information
6737747 there is no question there is no doubt what happened that day and i think its appalling that anyone might try to put out that kind of myth i think its also appalling for anyone to continue to give those sorts of people any kind of publicity
6737748 to even suggest that aa77 did not crash into the pentagon on september 11 is the ultimate insult to the memory of the 59 men women and children on aa77 and the 125 dedicated military and civilian workers in the pentagon who were ruthlessly murdered by terrorists on september 11

6737754 we are ready to discuss with turkey all kinds of regional initiatives but at this stage there is no possibility that we would enter any cooperation mechanism with russia as long as the occupation goes on and a single occupying soldier stays on my soil
6737755 after occupying forces leave and all of those people who were forced out of their houses go back then we will start talking and discussing future probabilities and possibilities but again i can assure that the territorial integrity of georgia will maintain

6737773 if people want to assess the blame to me thats ok
6737774 i mean i can take whatever it is that people are going to dish out we had good chemistry the hand was back there she was there i dont know what happened
6737775 i went as a tourist a backpacker i never expected to stay but when i came to new zealand i fell in love
6737776 i fell in love on two counts i fell in love with the country and a gold prospector
6737777 i based a lot of what happens to kelly in the book on my own experiences when i first went out there except i didnt ride a triumph motorbike
6737778 i also featured the scottish drug enforcement agency in the book and they said to me to pop in and see them when i was in glasgow i might just do that
6737779 you wouldnt find a new zealand publisher producing romantic suspense
6737780 i suppose the publishing industry there is very much like scotland its a small country and the emphasis is on non fiction and literary fiction as a writer of popular fiction you have to go outside new zealand which is harder because you have to compete with all the other authors elsewhere
6737781 i thought i would never live to see the book published
6737782 i had three tumours on my lung and numerous lesions it was looking very bleak i couldnt breathe properly and i had to be propped up in bed so i couldnt even lie down to sleep
6737783 all the time i was lying in bed i was thinking if i get better i am going to come back to scotland that kept me going
6737784 thats why writing is such a great passion of mine
6737785 when im doing that i can forget about my own problems
6737786 i always remember when i used to walk round to redcastle
6737787 im going to use that setting but the difference in my book is that the castle is going to be whole that will be another romantic suspense novel and ive already written the first chapter its about a kiwi novelist who comes over to scotland and meets a scottish girl its great fun creating all these different people to me they are alive imagination is a wonderful thing
6737788 i like the slow pace of life in new zealand
6737789 what kept me there apart from andrew is that i like the outdoors and the weather and the sense of freedom and space also i think there were opportunities there that i wouldnt have had here at that time
6737790 the west coast reminds me of home the bush and the hills are very much like scotland and scottishness is in the fabric of the culture
6737791 ive found a warmth here that i didnt expect i always felt before that people got on with their own business and there was a reserve here but maybe its me whos changed
6737792 he came on with probably half an hour to go at burnley in a pre season friendly and did exceptionally well
6737793 it was at that point that i thought he could do a job in the first team especially as he came up against the boy ade akinbiyi who is a strong player but he handled him without any problems at all
6737794 perhaps i do have to look at bringing in another defender but i want to wait and see who is available there might not be anyone who fits the bill with regards to what im looking for
6737795 russell duncan has hurt his hamstring and will definitely miss saturdays game while david proctor picked up a knock in training so well just have to wait and see how he is
6737796 im also hoping that grant munro will be able to step up training next week but he is not going to be involved against hibs either
6737797 every fan is the same nowadays in that they are desperate for the club they support to do well
6737798 were all under pressure so weve got to live with it
6737799 they finished sixth last season and theyll be looking to improve on that everyone wants a good start to the season but lets just hope we can put a downer on them come saturday
6737800 they had a great result last weekend and by all accounts it was well deserved however im looking for my players to replicate the performances they gave against the likes of aberdeen and liverpool
6737801 dan is still with us although the conditions at training this week have not been ideal for him
6737802 however it is looking likely that i will keep him here for a second week
6737803 hes not the biggest of players but hes strong and desperate to do well his enthusiasm has been absolutely top class
6737804 hell be with us until friday but i wont be doing anything
6737805 from the outside you could be forgiven for forming the view that the department has started the process of deliberately running down the day care centres before the alternative strategy they are talking about is fully understood costed or in place
6737806 if it were to close we would be totally lost
6737807 it is very important for my daughter it stimulates her and it is where she meets a lot of her friends
6737808 i think there has been a lot of concern from people that the service will wind down
6737809 we are committed to delivering services to people with learning disabilities but these services may be delivered in a different way
6737810 there are no proposals to close the centre at this time
6737811 we do not envisage a sudden shift we see it as moving forward
6737812 the users are some of the most vulnerable people in society and are getting a raw deal
6737813 thats a new thing for us and we will have to see what interest there is for that part of the additional programme
6737814 the childrens events are very new for us so this is a bit of a pilot but we know there are huge childrens book events in edinburgh and bath and that is something we are looking towards
6737815 we want people to get involved in other things rather than just listening to authors and it will be interesting to see how people respond to that
6737816 usually after each festival i get a letter or two of encouragement or people come up and say how much they enjoyed it
6737817 this is a thing inverness has taken to its heart
6737818 we started from nothing because inverness had no culture of doing an event like that but with the new venues bars restaurant and cinemas at eden court we can really create the kind of festival inverness deserves
6737819 but i saw a review from the edinburgh book festival which said he had the audience in stitches which is unusual for kelman so well have to see what hes like in inverness
6737820 its one of those books you read with a lump in your throat he doesnt do a lot of events but i asked and he said yes
6737821 sporting biography is not something i usually go for but this is incredibly well written
6737822 we also have joe boyd the legendary music producer when nick drake made a demo tape he gave it to joe boyd who produced his first two albums he produced pink floyds first single and supervised bob dylans first electric set at newport so he has been around
6737823 we are deeply hurt this thing has been coming for the past five to six years but there is no significant improvement in the negotiations now we are told to shut up
6737824 the other interest rates at this stage are prime rate 15 25 at first national bank while bank windhoek offers prime rate plus 1 per cent 16 25
6737825 the other banks standard bank and nedbank need to establish themselves first and work out their loan rates
6737826 the main issue which led to our formation was the previous wage negotiations you have about 300 security companies operative across the country with san only representing about 25 of these
6737827 its not that we dont want to go according to the law but we want to be considered during negotiations
6737828 and at the end of the last negotiations they had no problem with accepting an amount that is causing a lot of trouble for the less established companies
6737829 a small company depends a lot more on a single client
6737830 so you lose that valuable client to a company who doesnt feel the same pinch as you do from this new minimum wage
6737831 they have many different reasons but much of it seems based on costs
6737832 anybody that wants to contribute to our fight for the industry
6737833 the ituc strongly protests against the arrest of jan sithole secretary general of the swaziland federation of trade unions sftu by the swazi authorities
6737834 theres no doubt i lost the fight by miles but not scoring a point
6737835 im getting drug tested here the judges should be getting drug tested
6737836 both of them seem to be more focused elsewhere iraq for one thing
6737837 a sort of mixture of mozart toscanini horatio alger hero and frank sinatra
6737838 although there was a noticeable increase in the inflation rate since the bon committee last met two months ago we remain confident that our international reserves which have further strengthened remain the nominal anchor to ensure long term price stability
6737839 we are also in contact with the bankers association of namibia about this topic
6737840 commercial banks have to bridge the gap between the reserve bank rate and the prime lending rate
6737841 bon views it as undesirable that the differential between the repo rate of 10 5 per cent to the commercial banks and the 15 25 prime lending rate of commercial banks remains substantial despite the fact that the bank rate is 50 basis points lower than that of the south african repo rate
6737842 this policy has been followed for nearly a year now and it definitely helps consumers who have been hammered by soaring fuel and food prices this year
6737843 credit growth has recently decreased to around 10 per cent down from over 20 per cent indicating that consumers hold back on making new debt but keeping the repo rate steady will a big relief to house owners and those who have pay off their cars
6737844 obesity is occurring at epidemic rates in the u s and worldwide and that impacts the risk and prognosis of many diseases
6737845 i am thrilled with this news my company last came to the edinburgh festival in 1992 and it is so rewarding and exciting that after such a long time there is so much interest in our new show dorian gray
6737846 matthew bournes dorian gray has become the biggest selling dance show in the festivals history and i am delighted that it is proving so popular though it doesnt come as a surprise he has been thrilling dance fans and bringing new audiences to dance successfully for years now i am very pleased that we are able to present the world premiere of his new work based on oscar wildes the picture of dorian gray

6737848 the fundamentals of our economy are strong john mccain admitted that hes lost count of how many houses he owns
6737849 john mccain continues to find new ways to show how out of touch he is with the challenges facing the american people
6737850 while millions of families are struggling to stay in their homes john mccain cant even keep track of how many he owns no wonder he thinks the fundamentals of our economy are sound and is offering more of the same disastrous economic policies weve seen for the last eight years americas working families simply cannot afford more of the same failed and out of touch economic agenda
6737851 obesity is occurring at epidemic rates in the u s
6737852 there is an urgent medical need for effective treatment options for non small cell lung cancer because current treatment strategies have only a minimal impact on survival
6737853 the majority of patients who are newly diagnosed with non small cell lung cancer have locally advanced or metastatic disease that is currently incurable we look forward to evaluating the potential of mapatumumab plus chemotherapy to offer a new approach to the first line treatment of this deadly disease
6737854 a growing body of preclinical data suggests that combining hgs etr1 with chemotherapy agents could be an effective approach to the treatment of a number of malignancies including non small cell lung cancer
6737855 hgs etr1 is the most advanced of any product in development that targets the trail apoptotic pathway the nsclc study is one of three ongoing hgs trials designed to evaluate combinations of hgs etr1 with chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of specific cancers
6737856 goes away looks closely at what it has achieved in the last 11 years and evaluates what is good and what the bang for the buck was what did we get for our investment

6737859 lord giddens is absolutely right we need to look for a new paradigm the new labour paradigm has run its course and we need to find a new one based on the evidence based on whats worked
6737860 a party in government can do it and the real challenge to gordon and the rest of the leadership of the party is to show that they have the strength will and purpose to do it
6737861 i very much doubt there will be a leadership challenge
6737862 the era of the zionists has come to its end and i recommend that the leaders of europe and the u s not submit to the zionists if they help them they will be harmed also among the leaders of europe and the u s there is serious doubt regarding the existence of zionism and soon we will witness the disappearance of this corrupt germ from the region

6737970 intervene effectively and immediately to save punjab from being turned into another kashmir by the congress partys highly ill advised and ill conceived move of setting up a separate gurdwara panel
6737971 i hope the centre would realize the gravity of the situation and stop the haryana government from going ahead with its attempts to break up the supreme and elected sikh religious institution the shiromani gurdwara parbandhak committee sgpc
6737972 we are a peace loving community and we are hoping that the attempts to open a fresh festering wound in the country in punjab would be dropped the whole of the country is already up in flames and it can easily do without another trouble spot in punjab along the lines of jammu and kashmir
6737973 the prime minister informed us that he could understand the seriousness of the problem and the sensitivities of the sikh masses on the issue as his own father had courted arrest in the struggle for the formation of the sgpc before independence of the country
6737974 we have already paid a very heavy price for similar misadventures of the congress in trying to divide the sikhs we are hoping that mrs sonia gandhi would draw correct lessons from punjabs and countrys traumatic experience of the eighties and not persist with her partys dangerous adventurism in haryana and punjab
6737975 the enormity of the blunder being committed by the congress with regard to the sgpc is many times more dangerous and that party must not be allowed to play havoc with national interests for its petty political gains

6738028 but this morning it was not possible to say with certainty that a substantial pullout was taking place we must wait and see what happens in the coming hours
6738029 we attach a lot of importance on the fact that such a settlement can only be temporary

6738031 fue un error no haber analizado los antecedentes de marsans cuando se la acept como operador en 2001 ya que en poco m s de un lustro ambas compa as logran acumular una deuda exigible de u s 240 millones y un pasivo de u s 890 millones
6738032 lo firmado implica as nom s hacernos cargo de una deuda de u s 900 millones
6738033 sentarse frente a marsans sin establecer un valor cierto de la empresa y sin ninguna alternativa es regalar la negociaci n
6738034 nos ofenden cuando nos dicen que queremos estatizar una deuda muchos de los que hoy est n sentados aqu tuvieron responsabilidad en los otros gobiernos

6738043 you are going to be mad at me but i am sorry
6738044 its now clear that the economy will be the tipping point in this election and the candidate who has the best answer to getting america growing again without inflation is going to tap the winning segment of this electorate i like johns ideas but he has more to do in terms of making his case and connecting with voters on the economy
6738045 obama has the better set of policies but has he effectively conveyed those policies in a way that votes will understand thats the challenge for his campaign
6738046 neither obama nor mccain owns the economy as an issue because theyve never focused on it really in ways that working class families would identify with
6738047 obama has always been about hope and change in a broad sense while mccain has always been about foreign policy and experience
6738048 it wasnt because she was lazy its because she was a single mom who was working and going to school at the same time trying to raise two kids trying to make a better life for herself and her family
6738049 dont be fooled by all this talk about class warfare we just want to make the economy fair so that everybodys got a chance not just some people

6738066 is it iran russia the price of oil terrorism it may in some ways look like the cold war again but the context today is blurred past recognition
6738067 will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic means
6738068 nato is trying to make a victim of an aggressor georgia and whitewash a criminal regime
6738069 the russian federation and the united states are not about to enter a new cold war even if tensions between moscow and washington rise dramatically
6738070 the cold war pitted an ideologically driven soviet union against the free world a conflict where both sides devoted enormous resources to defeat the other
6738071 an ideologically driven notion that the only possible choices these two countries have for relations are total conflict or total agreement neither of which is possible or desirable
6738072 we are stuck in relationships in which major powers are not enemies but not friends
6738073 the un isnt working the new world order and the democracy surplus never came to be but there are networks of capital and cooperation between russia china and the west that werent there before
6738074 a new context of fear rippling through its border regions
6738075 if you take one action it can boomerang and harm something else
6738076 russias strength is made possible by oil at 150 a barrel
6738077 if oil is cut to 60 a barrel russia is sunk russians spend less on research and development than poland they want bank accounts in the west to make millionaires off sales to europe they dont want a big war they want to gain influence and manipulate
6738078 conducting a pre planned routine visit to the black sea region to interact and exercise with our nato partners romania and bulgaria which is an important feature of our routine planning
6738079 it was great to kick off the partnership today and give the teenagers a chance to meet their idols

6738088 ive talked to a lot of medical people in recent months
6738089 and they all tell me that if you had to pick a way to die this is the way to go
6738090 i spend a great deal of time going over the information with my staff its the most serious thing we do within our criminal justice system and its a responsibility that i take very seriously
6738091 now that the storys out you might as well do something about it
6738092 he thought it was a movie and asked where his father was and when the movie would end
6738093 i work full time but food gas everything has just gone through the roof
6738094 its horrible congress is on vacation and theyre probably soaking up the rays somewhere were soaking up high gas prices
6738095 russia in this case will have to react and not only through diplomatic protests
6738096 an attack upon one is an attack upon all and thats the strongest possible guarantee you can have
6738097 would you like to go to sams with me and have a beer
6738098 how about going to the bar and having a drink with me

6738100 i heard you the first time im putting bloody on my shoes
6738101 if you learn how to act im in deep trouble
6738102 the biggest stunt i always say on the indiana jones films was stopping harrison doing the stunts because i had to fight nearly every time to stop him
6738103 i had to rely on a horse and horses have a sense of survival and they dont actually do what you tell them to do as they havent read the script
6738104 it always works better if you do have a relationship with the actor you can mimic how they move how they work when you coordinate fights for them like i did with harrison
6738105 forty dollars a day and all you can eat fantastic living
6738106 the films ive done ive been very lucky to have been very prolific in an area and a time when iconic films were being made
6738107 my first stunt on a bond film was in 1966 in the winter of
6738108 my personal preference is for real action just enhanced or maybe helped by computers we use computers to take away fall pads or wires if youre getting snatched or thrown in the air
6738109 i was cheaper and it didnt matter if i got hurt
6738110 and it is the internet phenomenon that exemplifies the it revolution
6738111 you dont understand ive been in the united states for the last month and i didnt see nearly as many beautiful women as i do on the streets here
6738112 since a politician never believes what he says he is quite surprised to be taken at his word
6738113 ninety percent of the politicians give the other ten percent a bad reputation
6738114 mereka tidak menawarkan apapun sebagaimana kami yang tidak meminta apapun
6738115 saya rasa ketakutan masih terasa jelas menyangkut kondisi pasar sektor keuangan

6738117 i think there is still a lot of fear in the market in terms of the financial sector

6738131 there are risks around us in everyday life and weve got to expose our children to a certain amount of risk
6738132 if a child pricks its finger on one of the fronds it wont do it again there are plenty of other shrubs and plants around that pose a similar risk
6738133 the tree will remain and the children can continue playing
6738134 als ik terug ben in nederland ga ik alle mails eens rustig bekijken maar als het boek van kwaliteit is zou het wel mooi zijn als mijn verhaal wordt uitgegeven
6738135 ik heb al veel mails gekregen van familieleden met vergelijkbare verhalen die heel veel steun uit mijn prestatie halen dat is wat ik graag wilde bereiken
6738136 een spaanse basketballer stak bijvoorbeeld zijn duim naar mij op die waardering is toch wel erg leuk
6738137 weve always had a policy for dealing with domestic violence but no detail on how to implement it which meant it was difficult for us to respond to this crime consistently across our organisation
6738138 at its core this is all about saving lives and giving staff the ability to recognise the signs that someone is suffering from domestic abuse and what they can do to help them
6738139 we need to get staff to think about things other than rent arrears or taking action against people for anti social behaviour and that things may not always be as black and white as first seems
6738140 its also about giving residents the correct support helping them to get out of an abusive relationship if they want to and knowing who they can go to for more advice
6738141 this toolkit will mean that our housing staff have the resources at their fingertips to be able to help survivors of domestic abuse at the first crucial point when they decide that enough is enough and that they need to tell someone what is happening to them
6738142 staff can provide advice on what other options are available to them we can offer support and advice and help them make a decision about whether they want to leave the relationship and can give them protection if they do make the decision to leave
6738143 we can also help with emergency accommodation if the person feels they will not be safe if they remain at home
6738144 this is our commitment to dealing with domestic abuse since november when we started recording incidents we have added 31 cases to the file
6738145 a large organisation like merlin with such direct links with communities and residents will provide an ideal mechanism for helping to increase reporting by identifying and supporting victims
6738146 this is an important milestone for partnership working to tackle domestic violence not just for south gloucestershire but as a blueprint for the south west region
6738147 las dos chicas se revuelcan en la cama es una escena realmente caliente

6738150 posiblemente tiene que ver con dos hechos primero fue correctamente sociabilizada con el ser humano y toma a las personas como parte de su grupo
6738151 un animal salvaje hambriento o no sociabilizado posiblemente se la hubiese comido
6738152 otro punto clave explic es su instinto maternal en pleno funcionamiento porque ella ten a sus cachorros
6738153 hay hormonas relacionadas con la crianza como la prolastina que estimula la lactaci n y el comportamiento maternal dado que ten a cachorros actu como madre
6738154 si no hubiese tenido cachorros lo hubiese hecho igual es menos probable hay perras que no cuidan ni a sus propios cachorros y hay hembras destac que lo hacen de una manera muy importante
6738155 no se sent a tomar una decisi n directamente actu en el mbito cient fico dir an que eso es s lo instinto pero como observador de los hechos cotidianos con los animales no creo que sea s lo eso
6738156 mucha gente considera que el animal es un humano y muchos cient ficos consideran que es casi una m quina son extremos no es un humano pero tambi n es mucho m s que una m quina que no encontremos la explicaci n y quieran volcar todo como instinto plante es s una cuesti n humana
6738157 si nos atrevemos a explorarlos sin ser soberbio pero sin mucha duda entre los hombres y los animales hay una diferencia de grado y no de clase compartimos muchos comportamientos el humano es tambi n un animal

6738162 nigel kennedy lives down the road at number 91 he sometimes pops in to say hello on a saturday morning on his way back from buying milk
6738163 i certainly think its a good sign for the democrats
6738164 it looks more dramatic than it probably is because of the way we do voter registration in this state but theres no question the enthusiasm for voting in the democratic primary was palpable not only in ohio but throughout the country
6738165 it means theres obviously a concerted effort by democrats and democratic forces there

6738168 we will continue to monitor the situation and provide boards of elections with the instruction and support they need to ensure an orderly and efficient election and an accurate count of ohioans votes
6738169 we are indeed distressed that our previous analysis of this issue was in error

6738207 one explanation might be that i couldnt afford a car or a girlfriend at the time so i got a dog and a motorcycle instead
6738208 but really i had been considering getting a dog for some time and id heard a story about prince rupert of the rhine carrying a poodle into battle so i thought id do it
6738209 ive had people literally queuing up behind me on the motorway so they can take a photo and ive been mobbed at petrol stations its quite disconcerting in a way

6738212 facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the united states when bm was being detained by the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer in pakistan in the period april 2002 until at least 17 may 2002 when he was seen by an officer of the security service
6738213 that the security service continued to facilitate the interviewing of bm by providing information and questions after 17 may 2002 in the knowledge of what was reported to them as to the circumstances of his detention and treatment in pakistan
6738214 and they must also have appreciated that he was not in a united states facility
6738215 by seeking to interview bm in the circumstances found in pakistan and supplying information and questions for his interviews the relationship between the united kingdom and the united states authorities was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing
6738216 the court has no doubt that on the basis of that information the security service were right to conclude that bm was a person of great potential significance and a serious potential threat to the national security of the united kingdom
6738217 the central mission of this base is to house the marines that will be training members of the 28th iraqi army
6738218 the seabees of nmcb 17 did an outstanding job more than we could ever expect now all we have to do is move in and call it home
6738219 the seabees did a great job using the battle buddy system of monitoring each other to prevent heat injuries
6738220 to counteract the heat we adhered to a work rest schedule taking breaks depending on the heat index
6738221 we use the heat index to set our flag conditions
6738222 if there is no wind or cloud cover then we dont hesitate to put up the black flag our most dangerous heat condition
6738223 we used three loaders an excavator four dump trucks and a d 8 dozer to cut out approximately thirty thousand cubic yards of dirt
6738224 while working 10 hour days our major obstacle was a rock bed but we overcame it by pushing dirt in the opposite direction to get underneath the rock
6738225 some days the heat was unbearable but we managed to push our way through it to complete our mission we installed 80 air conditioning units and i must say i have a new found appreciation for the weather i have at home

6738235 f r russland w re es beraus g nstig diese republiken jetzt anzuerkennen das w re unbestreitbar der gr te au enpolitische sieg unseres landes in den letzten jahren es darf jedoch nicht vergessen werden dass die anerkennung f r die wirtschaftlichen interessen unserer politischen elite im westen ein starker schlag w re diese personen treten jetzt intensiv gegen die anerkennung auf deshalb wird sie sich jahrelang hinziehen
6738236 wenn der westen saakaschwili weiter unterst tzen wird hei t das zweifellos dass eine wiederholung des milit rischen einsatzes in s dossetien vorbereitet wird dann wird die vorbereitung einer neuen aggression uns vor die notwendigkeit von hilfs und schutzma nahmen stellen die anerkennung der unabh ngigkeit aber wird die m glichkeit geben eigene kr fte dorthin zu schicken

6738241 there is nothing pro family about rolling back protections for some families
6738242 governor jindal is proposing an unacceptable step backwards for louisiana
6738243 our states proud history of union justice confidence is undermined when our public leaders strip our families of basic protections we should all enjoy there is nothing pro family about rolling back protections for some families
6738244 allowing louisianas anti discrimination order to expire would mean the end of any legal protection for gay citizens in the state
6738245 by not renewing this critically important measure governor jindal would remove the welcome mat from louisianas front door it is imperative and urgent that the governor not allow the states commitment to non discrimination to expire
6738246 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6738247 the worlds pretty serious right now and theres an ironic lightness in virulents
6738248 theres a touch of macabre ridiculousness to it i think weve seen a lot of attempts to make serious movies about serious things and it strikes me that we might be a little more artful about how we make a point these days
6738249 i think hes an actor of unlimited potential and id just love to go around with him again
6738250 because he has been assessed to be a threat to the security of iraq and coalition forces
6738251 if there are legitimate issues about him or any other journalist lets have them aired openly and tested if there are none let them pursue their profession free from intimidation and fear
6738252 im delighted that ali has finally been released and that it turns out there was no basis for his detention but i remain concerned that such actions can be taken against a working journalist with their reasons never being explained or justified
6738253 ali is part of our iraqi family his colleagues in london and baghdad are delighted hes been freed we now look to the american military authorities to offer evidence and an explanation for alis detention

6738292 ultimate goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6738293 what were trying to do is to put together an agreement that protects our people that respects iraqi sovereignty that allows us to lay the kind of foundation that we need for making certain that we complete the work that weve all sacrificed so greatly to see accomplished and that work is being accomplished
6738294 the question in this case is whether permitting authorities may supplement inadequate monitoring requirements when epa has taken no action
6738295 if the monitoring isnt good enough the whole system falls apart
6738296 affects every major stationary air pollution source in the country this is a very important case just in terms of the publics right to know and guarding the publics opportunity to keep tabs
6738297 determine the appropriate course of action once the review is complete we are still assessing the implications of the decision
6738298 is a complex statute with a clear objective it enlists epa and state and local environmental authorities in a common effort to create a permit program for most stationary sources of air pollution
6738299 by its terms this mandate means that a monitoring requirement insufficient to assure compliance with emission limits has no place in the permit unless and until it is supplemented by more rigorous standards

6738305 everybody has interpreted the shrinking population of working age people as a mass exodus by young people out of vermont but thats really a very small part of the story
6738306 the biggest part of the story is that people just arent being born

6738308 employers cite adequacy of the work force as one major concern for future success here
6738309 we have employers who have created good jobs and want to create more but they need a qualified work force to take those jobs

6738314 one of the instruments in an extremely dangerous bundle of american military projects involving the one sided development of a global missile shield system
6738315 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6738316 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to nuclear attack one hundred percent
6738317 russia will have to point its warheads at ukrainian territory
6738318 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6738319 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around

6738413 major league baseball and the media they want instant replay and were going to have instant replay so if it delays the game then theres nothing we can do about it
6738414 i know they were doing some tests on things that the commissioner and jimmie lee were working on it ive been talking to solomon about other things thats been the furthest thing from my mind
6738415 hopefully they let the pitchers have a few pitches just to make sure theyre loose

6738431 una vez m s dependemos de nosotros y si nosotros nadamos el africa el ejercicio de ma ana una vez m s como solemos hacer la medalla es nuestra
6738432 cuando he visto a las chinas c mo ejecutaban he pensado han aprendido la lecci n de lo que les ha pasado en el d o y han sacado un merecido tercero pero un poco demasiado cerca de nosotros y nosotros un poco lejos de las rusas
6738433 yo creo que hubiera estado mejor espa a y rusia desmarcadas del tercer lugar en este sentido yo creo que el sorteo no nos ha sido favorable y es el precio que se tiene que pagar por ser el n mero uno
6738434 es menos controlable todo lo que te va a pasar hasta que te toca salir
6738435 hemos apostado por nadar y hacer una acrobacia m s por hacer una rutina m s r pida sobre todo porque si tenemos suerte de salir por delante de china que realmente se vea la diferencia de nivel y de madurez
6738436 lo mejor para la competici n es que la ltima sea china en el orden de salida de ma ana lo que est claro lo que me gustar a es salir cerca de rusia y de china para establecer la diferencia
6738437 lo que les ha pasado hoy a las japonesas es mala suerte estaban aqu desde la ocho de la ma ana dale que te pego y en las coreograf as no han estado ajustadas
6738438 la rutina es siempre la misma puedes fallar los elementos de m xima potencia el salto en la de hoy pero en la de ma ana s que podemos ver fallos podemos ver saltos que no saltan plataformas que se caen entonces s que la competici n se nos va

6738444 no puedo decir que a gaby mercedes lo despojaran de la medalla dorada aunque s puedo afirmar que el hecho de que mario v zquez ra a quien tambi n es de m xico estuviera presenciando el combate fue algo que le dio ventaja al azteca y al final los rbitros se inclinaran por el mexicano

6738454 estamos siguiendo el proceso establecido y debemos darle al deporte del boxeo la oportunidad de lavar su imagen

6738665 jika seorang isteri itu telah menunaikan solat lima waktu dan berpuasa pada bulan ramadhan dan menjaga kemaluannya daripada yang haram serta taat kepada suaminya maka dipersilakanlah masuk ke syurga dari pintu mana sahaja kamu suka

6738805 highlights once again the need for comprehensive immigration reform families have been disrupted parents and children are filled with fear many are uncertain whether their loved ones will be arrested imprisoned indefinitely or deported
6738806 this state of terror for families is evidence that our political system has not adequately addressed the demand for labor the inadequacies of our present immigration policies and practices and the broader economic challenges some of the weakest members among us are bearing the brunt of the suffering while legislators and other leaders as well as many of us in the general public have failed to give this issue the priority that it deserves

6738855 now we see russian forces which responded to attacks on russian peacekeepers in south ossetia legitimately we see those forces now having advanced on to the soil of georgia georgian territorial integrity is in question here
6738856 we did not want to see a recourse to violence and force and we made that very very clear
6738857 the fact that we were trying to convince the georgian side not to take this step is clear evidence that we did not want all this to happen

6738895 immediately transform the conflict into a direct confrontation between a democratic david and an autocratic goliath making sure the sympathy of the western world would be mobilized for georgia
6738896 at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
6738897 we have received formal notification via military channels that russia has decided to halt international military cooperation events until further notice
6738898 everything depends on nato priorities the priority is for unconditional support of georgian president mikheil saakashvili then we wont be to blame for the bankrupting of the alliances relations with russia
6738899 russia no less than nato relies on this mutual cooperation nato is much more in need of russias support of its military actions in afghanistan where natos fate appears to be in the balance

6738952 the uk like other economies is seeing the consequences of globally high commodity prices as well as the uncertainty in the credit markets the governments priority is to guide britain through these challenging times while also supporting those hit hardest as a result of these global factors
6738953 the revised gdp figures confirm that the office of national statistics original second quarter estimate was too optimistic the messages signalled by our quarterly survey were more realistic todays figures show that manufacturing and construction declined in the second quarter and total gdp stagnated given the heightened threats of uk recession it is vital that the monetary policy committee starts cutting interest rates in october or november as soon as it is clear that cpi inflation has peaked
6738954 the second estimate of uk economic growth in the second quarter of 2008 by the office for national statistics shows that the economy registered no growth from the first quarter this is a substantial downward revision from the previous estimate of 0 2 growth in the quarter expectations had been divided between the overall figure remaining unchanged or being downwardly revised to 0 1 the result will therefore be a shock to the markets and is likely to push sterling and the ftse lower and bond prices higher in trading today year on year economic growth is now 1 4 per cent the weakest since 1992

6738958 natural gas has been displacing oil for the last decade
6738959 natural gas utilities are reporting high levels of switching from oil to gas among residential consumers
6738960 anyone that can use both fuels has been using natural gas for over a year
6738961 was flared off oil well platforms in the gulf as a byproduct because it wasnt worth the time or effort to bring it to market via pipelines
6738962 were being given an opportunity to now harness the power of natural gas and use it as the conduit for a shift to a green domestically controlled energy infrastructure
6738963 natural gas will be the bridge fuel to the u s untangling itself from the strict reliance on foreign oil
6738964 doesnt start ramping up natural gas usage and create new natural gas powered vehicles then prices will fall in the face of this drastic supply increase while making us even more dependent on foreign oil

6738980 everyday we should be putting pressure on our nato allies either bilaterally or multilaterally to make sure were are all pulling our share
6738981 its just too expensive for me to pay 5 a day for my daughters to eat a school lunch
6738982 and the quality of the food isnt that great either
6738983 like everyone else the district is affected by rising food prices and the fuel to deliver that food
6738984 parents see the price increase every time they go to the grocery store
6738985 its just one more thing that is going up as a result of gas prices
6738986 whether its buying our sons school clothes textbooks pencils or lunch its one more thing that is affecting our wallets you cant blame the farmers you cant blame the school districts its just the reality of the world now
6738987 so this would make the hybrid bus cost about what the yellow bus costs

6738989 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
6738990 o actual sil ncio da direc o do psd est errado errado porque um pa s em dificuldades n o foi de f rias e precisava de ouvir a voz de uma oposi o alternativa
6738991 how in the world did you manage to get so dirty
6738992 the reason premiums have dropped is life insurance is now based on the new 2001 cso mortality tables and those mortality tables show that people are living longer so that when companies are calculating the cost of insurance from a mortality standpoint they can charge a lesser amount
6738993 the average person should have 20 times their annual income
6738994 det ville have v ret nemmere at bide t nderne sammen tage nedskrivningerne og st krisen igennem hvis man med et brancheudtryk havde
6738995 jeg vil gerne meget kraftigt understrege at roskilde banks engagement p ejendomsmarkedet ikke indeholder den risiko som der tilsyneladende er opst et et rygte om
6738996 noget er tilsyneladende kommet helt bag p s ren kaare andersen eller ogs kom han bare for sent i forhold til det dobbeltslag der ramte roskilde bank nedturen p ejendomsmarkedet og tillidskrisen i banksektoren
6738997 jeg har kigget b gerne igennem det er klart at hvis ejendomsmarkedet falder 50 procent s f r vi t sk men det g r alle de andre banker ogs
6738998 det er derimod mere ubegribeligt for bankfolkene at nedskrivningerne fik ledelsen i roskilde bank til at s ge den likviditetsgaranti der med s godt som hundrede procents sikkerhed koster banken sin selvst ndighed mildt sagt en noget drastisk handling for en bank der oplyser at efter nedskrivninger p op mod 900 mio kr er banken fortsat solvent i forhold til lovkrav og det individuelle krav banken skal leve op til
6738999 s p tidspunktet for beslutningen kan man karakterisere forretningen som om ikke sund s levedygtig men udsat fordi ledelsen har frygtet et run p banken hvor kunderne stiller sig i k for at h ve deres indest ender

6739002 det er opad bakke for dem lige i jeblikket med den finansielle uro der er s kigger selskabets kunder lidt mere p omkostningerne frem for noget risikostyring hvilket presser oms tningen hos simcorp

6739005 the evolution of toilets from open fields to gunny sack structures to simple pits to ventilated pits to pour flush to water closet and the most recent western type of commode
6739006 we still find our public toilets clogged with sticks and stones and with faeces scattered on our footpaths even in cities something is amiss are we slipping back in time or have we failed to evolve with our toilets
6739007 although the provision of latrines is relatively high the conditions are very poor and the amount of usage is low
6739008 this is because of a lack of appropriate communication approach with rural communities and the absence of choice of latrine technologies
6739009 despite having two pay and use toilets which have been out of use for about six years
6739010 today only a few dogs visit the one storey toilet in thruepang
6739011 the municipal sweeper uses the other toilet as a residence
6739012 although the municipal office had planned to repair and reuse the facilities the municipality did not have funds
6739013 pull out your trainers and weapons or we will escalate our co operation with syria and iran
6739014 the entire front line of the israeli armys brass stepped down because of the lebanon war gal hirsch who was defeated in lebanon went to georgia and they too lost because of him
6739015 a direct challenge to the us dominated post cold war international order
6739016 we understand the russian stance and the russian military response as a result of the provocations which took place we appreciate the courageous decision taken by the russian leadership in responding to the international initiatives and the start of withdrawing its forces
6739017 will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic demarches
6739018 of all u s cultural products in the twentieth century surely movies were the most exemplary with the possible exception of food they were also the most adept medium for propaganda purposes tony shaws comprehensive survey of hollywoods role in the ideological contest between the united states and the soviet union from the 1920s onward leaves few archives untouched and few movies unseen
6739019 the liberal soul shall be made fat and he that watereth shall be watered also himself
6739020 you have a choice be a fighting liberal or sit quietly i know what i am what are you
6739021 whether we will be a wanted or an unwanted resident or a good corporate citizen
6739022 the move will be at great cost to tata motors and to shareholders but there is a concern about our people a definite concern about not being wanted
6739023 we have not come to exploit the people of west bengal
6739024 people thought i got a glove on it which i didnt i wish i did got me pretty square went toward first base and had to get the out
6739025 as bad as it hurt i wanted to make a play on it ran in to the dugout so i could rub it it was a pretty good shot it will still be a couple of days it will be a little sore but i will be all right
6739026 if we stay healthy well be a fast fun team to watch i promise you that we will be a team on that you can depend
6739027 if it hits your glove you have to catch it i make those plays nine out of 10 times

6739036 this case suggests that facial transplantation might be an option for restoring a severely disfigured face and could enable patients to readily integrate themselves back into society
6739037 our case confirms that face transplantation is surgically feasible and effective for the correction of specific disfigurement
6739038 a reinforcement of links between damascus and moscow amount to a very negative development
6739039 it would push syria to adopt an irresponsible and adventurist policy
6739040 would endanger peace in the world not only in the middle east
6739041 forceful return on the international stage doesnt guarantee in any way it will have a constructive role in the future of the middle east
6739042 it is difficult to believe in the good faith of moscow when it emerges despite all of moscows denials that russian weapons sold to syria have reached hezbollah
6739043 the only new element is that the israeli military aid given to georgia has given russia an argument to sell weapons to syria
6739044 has taken into account russian demands that it limit its military aid to georgia
6739045 is less important than that of the united states or france

6739051 we got very close to the limit at 45 nanometers we were able to innovate our way out of what seemed an unsolvable problem weve got some challenges ahead of us it looks like 32 nanometers is on track but you go beyond that and it looks a little bit iffy
6739052 we think cmos will continue to be the workhorse for many years in the future

6739054 the precise contours of the network management practices at issue here including what equipment has been utilized when it began to be employed when and under what circumstances it has been used how it has been configured what protocols have been affected and where it has been deployed
6739055 by monday i fully expect comcast will go into federal court to block the fccs enforcement of its order
6739056 the basis will be that the fcc isnt a proper agency for court discovery
6739057 the fcc does not have the authority it is claiming with this order
6739058 when first confronted with these press reports comcast the nations second largest provider of broadband internet access services misleadingly disclaimed any responsibility for the customers problems
6739059 comcast later changed its account and admitted that it targets peer to peer traffic for interference
6739060 if the fcc had done nothing it would have provoked a stronger reaction from net neutrality advocates and given them real ammunition to lobby for a law
6739061 what it has done is just say to comcast you cant do this try again
6739062 we dont know what the fccs reasoning is here how it is deciding whether a company is violating net neutrality principals or not
6739063 this ruling has created a lot of regulatory uncertainty it appears to be saying that a network practice is reasonable if it is disclosed to the customer but then where does that leave which does disclose that it limits p2p access on its wireless network
6739064 comcast and several other commenters maintain a continual refrain that all network providers must manage bandwidth in some manner and that providers need flexibility to engage in the reasonable network management practices we do not disagree which is precisely why we do not adopt here an inflexible framework micromanaging providers network management practices
6739065 we will decide this on a case by case basis
6739066 been honest with its customers and the fcc and explained upfront how it was managing its network they are basically being slammed for their failure to truthfully disclose
6739067 we felt disappointment mixed with panic i was worried about getting my money back and we were frantically trying to get other tickets because we really wanted to go
6739068 the boys were so upset and unhappy im a reasonably aware internet user and everything looked legit sites like this are hurting kids
6739069 sos was set up as a contrived rip off designed to fleece the general public advertising tickets at impossible to achieve prices we alerted the authorities abut this some two months ago
6739070 we do all we can both to publicise the authorised agents and warn against buying from unofficial sources using our website web forums and the press
6739071 but we cannot possibly prevent individuals visiting and purchasing from sites like these that appear without warning and usually disappear without warning too various official bodies are already investigating websites we have passed information about
6739072 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011
6739073 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6739074 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6739075 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6739076 the number of us military bases would depend on the size and the needs of the troops
6739077 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
6739078 the us has gone very far in this agreement it is a very advanced agreement
6739079 its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification or anything like that
6739080 despite prompt actions from prison officers and paramedics the prisoner was pronounced dead at 6 15am on saturday august 16
6739081 by a court that is not free and is heavily influenced by those who are simply scared of freeing mikhail khodorkovsky
6739082 the result will be a shock to the markets and is likely to push sterling and the ftse lower and bond prices higher in trading today
6739083 it seems that brown and darlings more generous interpretation of their fiscal rules has kept the uk out of contraction for now
6739084 the news brings to an end 64 quarters of consecutive growth and increases the likelihood that the bank of england will move to cut rates before the new year
6739085 we issued a release saying that over 40 olympic athletes downloaded the album in an act of solidarity and thats what triggered it then everything got blocked
6739086 we are aware of the logon problems but we have no comment at the moment
6739087 it seems like suspending itunes is punishment for itunes but really it doesnt hurt itunes it hurts us
6739088 some in beijing did download and i think thats what spooked the chinese government
6739089 theyre incredibly supportive people they wouldnt do anything like that
6739090 we may have to wait until early 2009 before we get the first rate cut because the inflation situation still looks pretty forbidding
6739091 the bank needs to prevent a fairly shallow recession from getting worse
6739092 the bank signaled that inflation is going to stay high for quite some time
6739093 they might want to see evidence that it has come down or is peaking before they opt for a rate cut
6739094 according to the order of the chief commander on august 22 friday at 6 am all russian troops will be pulled out from the territory of georgia and moved to south ossetia

6739123 i saw the scenes of the accident on television but i didnt know my brother was on that plane
6739124 it was my brothers father in law who contacted some friends in sao paulo to tell us that they had both died in the accident
6739125 our priority now is to bring his body home quickly
6739126 a light has come on but i dont know what it means

6739128 suddenly the plane started to shake it was going from one side to the other until it fell
6739129 later i just remember people on the ground smoke explosions and then i lost consciousness
6739130 i was saved by the paramedics its thanks to them that im alive i feel like ive been born again
6739131 the failure of one motor does not cause an accident im not so sure the engine failed the combination of causes will have to be determined
6739132 the pilot detected something when he took the plane off the runway he believed it was resolved if he decided to take off
6739133 the problem was located it was resolved and the plane was dispatched
6739134 the technician who inspected the plane was not able to repair the system
6739135 the solution was to disconnect it not to repair it
6739136 the accident may have been impossible to predict or there might have been negligence
6739137 if the take off was authorised without the fault being properly repaired there is clearly a legal responsibility
6739138 but that must all be cleared up before any decisions are taken
6739139 it will have to be seen which company did the inspection whether it is a company with staff from the same company spanair or from a subcontractor

6739151 mr gadd is pleased to be back in this country
6739152 the last few days as you know he has been travelling around asia and that time was not wasted
6739153 it enabled mr gadd and others to put into practice a plan for his proper and safe arrival
6739154 mr gadd is not a well man he needs medical attention and is also unsurprisingly concerned about his safety and these past few days have enabled the metropolitan police and i on his behalf to put into place a proper procedure for his protection and his well being
6739155 mr gadd is pleased to be back for another reason he is pleased to be back because for the first time he can appear before a court of justice
6739156 he tells me that his trial in vietnam a country which has been condemned by virtually every organisation concerned with justice and human rights as being a system of unfair justice and political trials was a charade was a travesty of justice
6739157 he never got a fair trial and in due course that will be expanded upon
6739158 this morning was an opportunity for him to come before english justice for the first time to make these points
6739159 unfortunately the court didnt agree with my submission that it should hear me on the issue about the unfairness of how he has been treated by the vietnamese system
6739160 that was an opportunity that i sought to take on his behalf but the court decided it did not want to hear
6739161 therefore this morning there has been no opportunity before an impartial tribunal to put forward why it was he was innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted in vietnam
6739162 there may be another opportunity in the future its too early to tell
6739163 mr gadd wants through me to say to you that he did not commit the offences for which he was convicted in vietnam
6739164 it was a show trial and he had no opportunity to put his defence forward
6739165 ultimately he wants that to be tested if he can before the courts of this country
6739166 that was the reason for this morning when i opposed the making of a notification order
6739167 i sought an interim order to give me an opportunity to develop what im saying to you but that was not given to me

6739171 the army and police arrested a suspected bomber not far away from scene of the attack
6739172 they also recovered a suicide jacket from a nearby mosque and seized explosives
6739173 the army has killed hundreds of innocent people and we attacked it to teach it a lesson

6739177 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6739178 the second most important question at least from my perspective is can this person help me govern
6739179 are they going to be an effective partner in creating economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6739180 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6739181 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6739182 there will be a time later for politics im a big believer that when youre in a crisis america speaks with one voice
6739183 indicates a new stage in the relationship between russia and the west
6739184 weve got to be firm with the russians in alliance with our european allies that this kind of behavior is intolerable
6739185 in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded by the events in the nation of georgia

6739194 i think its clear that athletics themselves would agree that they havent yet delivered in the same way that our most successful sports have like sailing rowing and cycling
6739195 they know that theyre on a journey and theres a long way to go
6739196 they know they have to create a better environment for athletes and better level of influence and support for personal coaches you have to be prepared to make some very tough decisions about which athletes you fund

6739203 i think its clear that athletics themselves would agree that they havent yet delivered in the same way that our most successful sports have like sailing rowing and cycling

6739205 they know they have to create a better environment for athletes and better level of influence and support for personal coaches you have to be prepared to make some very tough decisions about which athletes you fund
6739206 if you look at the cycling program one of the signs of the successful organization that it is is that it is prepared to make very hard decisions very tough decisions of which athlete it will work with and support and that is something we will discuss with uk athletics going forward
6739207 all sports will be treated in the same way on a no compromise basis

6739277 the evolution of toilets from open fields to gunny sack structures to simple pits to ventilated pits to pour flush to water closet and the most recent western type of commode
6739278 we still find our public toilets clogged with sticks and stones and with faeces scattered on our footpaths even in cities something is amiss are we slipping back in time or have we failed to evolve with our toilets
6739279 although the provision of latrines is relatively high the conditions are very poor and the amount of usage is low
6739280 this is because of a lack of appropriate communication approach with rural communities and the absence of choice of latrine technologies
6739281 despite having two pay and use toilets which have been out of use for about six years

6739332 were excited to tell atlantis stories on a bigger canvas
6739333 the successes of the two original stargate dtv movies the ark of truth and continuum have shown us the opportunities that the movie format offers we have plans for both sg 1 and atlantis to remain vital as we expand the franchise
6739334 we share in the producers enthusiasm to move forward in this direction and we look forward to a strong and continued relationship on stargate atlantis in this new format
6739335 unable to return to earth the crew must fend for themselves aboard the ship which has a preprogrammed mission taking them to the far reaches of the universe
6739336 this is an opportunity to reinvent this franchise and make it relevant to a new generation
6739337 we really dont want to be more of the same its going to build clearly off the existing franchise but with a cast that gives it a younger vibe
6739338 in universe we plan to keep those elements that have made the franchise a success such as adventure and humor while breaking new ground in the relationships between mostly young and desperate explorers thrust together and far from home
6739339 above all we believe the stargate itself remains an enduring icon with infinite potential as a jumping off point for telling stories

6739346 we believe that raids on the immigrant community are unjust unnecessary and counterproductive
6739347 we urge the federal government to fully respect the well founded principles of conscientious objection
6739348 would be better served by helping individuals to comply with the law or working to change those laws rather than asking law enforcement agents not to enforce it
6739349 if you choose to become a law enforcement officer you swear to uphold the laws of the state and the nation
6739350 thats what you do you dont want to do that then dont become a law enforcement officer
6739351 i think its an interesting idea because from our reports a lot of these raids have really impacted families and individuals and really terrorized communities
6739352 it should be logical that some agents think that tactic is too harsh and might not want to participate
6739353 wir hatten einen guten test in br nn und jetzt habe ich nach meinem podestplatz mein zweites heimrennen vor mir nachdem ich in den tests einige sehr positive sachen gefunden habe die uns f r den rest der saison und die zukunft helfen sollten
6739354 es war toll f r mich ein podium einzufahren aber ich wei dass wir nun anfangen k nnen noch bessere ergebnisse einzufahren das sollte der n chste schritt sein
6739355 alle arbeiten so hart und jetzt wo ich wieder vollst ndig fit bin kann ich so hart attackieren wie m glich um das zu schaffen
6739356 ich mag die strecke von misano wirklich sehr und ich wei dass ich dort sehr schnell sein kann wie ich es vergangenes jahr mit platz zwei gezeigt habe wir haben in br nn sowohl w hrend des rennwochenendes als auch beim test ein paar sachen gefunden
6739357 wir sind sehr froh ber diese daten die wir nun haben und jetzt m ssen wir sie auf das rennen bertragen ich muss weiterhin pushen weil ich wei dass ich konkurrenzf hig sein kann und mein team und suzuki tun alles was in ihrer macht steht um sicherzustellen dass wir die spitzenfahrer von beginn jedes wochenendes an herausfordern k nnen

6739375 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
6739376 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels it is vital that sensitive information such as prisoner records is held securely at all times
6739377 we can confirm that this morning the met was asked to provide assistance to pa consulting to review the circumstances of the loss of data on a pen drive by a member of their staff this data being provided to them by the home office as part of contracted work
6739378 charlie chaplin could do a better job running the home office than this labour government
6739379 the government will no doubt seek to blame private contractors but the rash of data losses over the past two years confirms that there is something much more worrying at stake this government cannot keep any information safe
6739380 this case highlights the fact that organisations need to ensure they have controls in place to protect data on all removable storage devices
6739381 the home office has informed us that an internal investigation is being carried out into the data security arrangements between the home office and its contractor pa consulting we expect the home office to provide us at the information commissioners office with a copy of the report and its findings we will then decide what further action may be appropriate

6739528 de cijfers tonen aan dat de havens van amsterdam een stabiele economische factor voor de amsterdamse regio blijven
6739529 dat verplicht ons om met nog meer urgentie na te denken over manieren waarop we deze groei duurzaam kunnen ondersteunen
6739530 nu na een halve eeuw willen we de discussie over waterbeheer en veiligheid levend houden
6739531 we willen zo veel mogelijk mensen informeren over toen en nu de bewoners van zowel capelle als krimpen moeten het belang zien van dit eerste deltawerk van nederland
6739532 dit eerste deltawerk is cruciaal in de beleving van mensen op het gebied van water en veiligheid
6739533 alleen al over 2007 zijn de bouwkosten met 8 procent gestegen onze investering blijft nu beperkt tot 23 miljoen euro dat vind ik voor een corporatie een aanvaardbaar bedrag
6739534 ik stond achter ons huis te luisteren naar het geronk van de vele toestellen die overkwamen opeens kwam er een brandend vliegtuig vanuit het oosten hij ging recht over me heen het was n grote vuurbal een paar tellen later hoorde ik niets meer het was muisstil en pikdonker
6739535 het was een vrij klein gat zon 2 tot 3 meter diep er was niets te zien en ik rook ook niets

6739541 egal ob online oder offline das auto ist des deutschen liebstes kind dabei machen die deutschen keinen unterschied zwischen gebraucht neu oder mietwagen auch in diesem bereich ist das internet f r viele ein wichtiges informations und bezugsmedium
6739542 das internet sollte insbesondere f r die preisfindung und als vorinformation aktiv genutzt werden so kann der gebrauchtwagenk ufer in den preisverhandlungen besser bestehen allerdings ist die live betrachtung des wunschfahrzeugs vor ort beim h ndler gerade bei lteren fahrzeugen unabdingbar da es sich bei gebrauchtwagen um unikate handelt

6739544 today i am a free man i am longer a slave i am among men who are the same colour as me who consider me as a man i earn 1 000 cfa 2 1 a day and that covers my needs
6739545 i decided i would have to go and get him so i hatched a plan i told my master that i needed to take ahmed to his grandparents
6739546 i said we would both return the next day but we never went back
6739547 the situation has not changed with the arrival of democracy
6739548 for example i have an encampment and many people have come to live with us seeking refuge from war and famine
6739549 they help us with rearing the animals and general work
6739550 but this is not slavery like you would find in the koran
6739551 the bella people are free to leave their masters if they wish
6739552 if people came out to declare openly that they are slaves then of course the state would do something
6739553 slavery is taboo no one wants to talk about it
6739554 particularly at the level of the authorities they will not accept that it persists
6739555 like his parents before him iddar was born a slave a status ascribed to him at birth and grew up under the total control of a master who exacted labour from him for no remuneration
6739556 in my view iddars case is a clear case of slavery
6739557 the difficulty of constructing a case for iddar demonstrates the need for a law criminalising slavery in mali

6739570 the stresses in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
6739571 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
6739572 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother
6739573 these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6739574 a developing fetus requires some exposure to maternal stress hormones as it normalizes their stress functioning
6739575 but women experiencing anxiety or excessive stress would do well to address it before a planned pregnancy and to have good social support systems
6739576 all the local government chairmen in the state should ensure that within the next 12 months all the roads in their various communities are made motorable even if it is ordinary earthwork that will be done on the road

6739580 its truly an honor to continue that tradition with this benefit concert for the center
6739581 you always find out whos been swimming naked when the tide goes out we found out that wall street has been kind of a nudist beach
6739582 what were seeing in business in our retail businesses or anything having to do with housing is even a further slowing down in june and july both in terms of credit experience where people first got in trouble with house payments and now credit card payments
6739583 in my judgment it wont be any better five months from now
6739584 this little tsunami was just a calling card a wake up call
6739585 she must love god her age 21 30 she long hair sic cute face she like children she love old people we can go to serve the lord together she simple not materialstic she soft polite gentle caring not easy to get angry patient she know how to drive

6739653 i also had contact with psg several weeks ago but now i am at arsenal and the fans know i can bring something to the team

6739685 nossos amigos de gaza nos pediram para trazer 9 mil aparelhos de audi o para crian as mas conseguimos trazer apenas 2 mil
6739686 na faixa de gaza existe um problema s rio muitas crian as ficaram surdas em decorr ncia do barulho cont nuo de explos es e choques ultra s nicos causados por ca as israelenses que sobrevoam freq entemente a regi o
6739687 tenho certeza de que israel vai impedir a nossa entrada na faixa de gaza
6739688 mas acho que do ponto de vista da lei internacional n o tem o direito de faz lo
6739689 eles podem revistar nossos barcos e procurar armas que obviamente n o v o achar mas n o podem nos impedir de entrar na regi o
6739690 se impedirem vai ficar claro que o bloqueio imposto por israel faixa de gaza n o apenas militar mas sim civil
6739691 a vantagem de uma a o n o violenta que de qualquer maneira se ganha se conseguirmos quebrar o cerco ganharemos e mesmo se formos presos ganharemos pois estaremos expondo a cara da ocupa o e o fato de que israel ainda est ocupando gaza

6739717 were keeping the pressure on the enemy and as weve done so weve defended this homeland
6739718 and we owe them something more the tools necessary to be able to do their job
6739719 we have used all these tools to stop new attacks
6739720 and i am pleased to report to the american people that these tools will be available for future administrations to protect the american people for years to come

6739745 the thing i loved the most about the book was how you would open it up to the first page expecting a horribly sad story about death but even by the time you finished that first page
6739746 you knew you were about to read some truly inspiring anecdotes about the exact opposite
6739747 its great to be able to nurture a childs creativity because to them the skys the limit and thats a great mindset to have
6739748 its seven seven houses and heres one house americans cant afford john mccain to move into
6739749 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6739750 i guess if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6739751 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6739752 a statewide search to find pennsylvanians who like john mccain have so many homes that they just cant keep track of the number
6739753 i think the big story here today is that there is for the first time an expression by foxwoods to reconsider their current site and they are actively exploring other sites that are not on the waterfront
6739754 we have shared with city and state officials the obstacles that resiting would entail
6739755 following those discussions we have agreed in principle to consider other alternative sites and ways that we can mutually overcome those obstacles we are committed to continuing those discussions while preserving our rights to the south columbus boulevard site
6739756 we anticipated that there would be two different meetings because the issues are different
6739757 a good first step towards achieving the goal of re siting both casinos
6739758 process is important and we dont want to go from one backroom deal to another
6739759 the people of philadelphia should be able to say whether they want casinos and where their preferred location should be not the casinos
6739760 its not time for celebration but its time to be optimistic
6739761 they dont love the pilot who came to kill their family
6739762 we were once face to face in a very difficult moment between life and death
6739763 we would be good friends if he were sitting in front of me now
6739764 first feeling was to look at him as a patient
6739765 doctors say im responding well although the treatments will continue the outlook is good im optimistic
6739766 i fully expect to conduct my duties as lieutenant governor the next two years in pennsylvania are going to be exciting as the governor follows through with his agenda on education the environment and the economy i intend to be right there to help him
6739767 the thing that concerns me the most is that its being reported that she is getting radiation and chemotherapy

6739771 my son and around 10 of his friends purchased weekend tickets for leeds festival they all paid at least 200 each
6739772 my son is a young struggling musician who lives for this weekend each year its been total heartbreak watching him run to get the post each day hoping and praying that tickets would arrive
6739773 its not even about the money how this guy from sos master ticket sleeps at night i dont know
6739774 he has waited about 8 years to see rage against the machine and now wont get to see them as it turns out this was a scam
6739775 parents who allow their children to eat too much could be as guilty of neglect as those who did not feed their children at all

6739777 rice smiled and if i remember correctly said she had had a chance to deal with georgia and its politicians but had not tasted its wine
6739778 i think that everything is possible as long as you put your mind to it and you put the work and time into it i think your mind really controls everything
6739779 if i want to be as successful as i want to be i have to be thinking about it all the time
6739780 you cant put a limit on anything the more you dream the farther you get
6739781 if you think you can do a thing or think you cant do a thing youre right
6739782 a lot of new obstacles are coming a lot of new feelings are coming im just taking it for what it is and learning from the mistakes i had this year

6739800 cuando yo descubro la ultraderecha de miami veo terroristas individuos que han servido a las peores causas de am rica latina como a los pinochet los somoza los stroessner
6739801 yo s voy a defender la soberan a de cuba de ese pueblo la reunificaci n de las familias y contra estos que piden muerte para los cubanos la invasi n de cuba practican el terrorismo aqu y en cuba son salvajes
6739802 la derecha en miami est en un curso de choque con la realidad
6739803 mayor a de la comunidad cubana favorece la normalizaci n de las relaciones con la isla
6739804 les cost tanto en sus relaciones con washington como en su imagen aqu
6739805 aqu viv an convencidos de que cuba no segu a sin fidel pero fueron obligados a ser testigos de que cuba no se va a desmoronar y por lo tanto la tesis que formaba el eje del argumento aqu no funciona
6739806 miami permanece como algo parecido a una dictadura como una rep blica bananera no hay democracia real pareciera que nosotros los cubanos no entendemos bien eso de la democracia no es parte de nuestra historia o cultura y los migrantes cubanos particularmente los que viven en miami aparentemente no han logrado captar el concepto
6739807 escuchar lo de cuba en nuestra comunidad es como escuchar m sica vieja son cosas de tus abuelos o tus padres es como escuchar a elvis
6739808 la percepci n que yo tengo de cuba es de los cuentos de mi abuela de los 50 entonces al hablar con los m s reci n llegados es hablar de dos pa ses completamente diferentes

6739811 i agreed to bring a brown bag lunch to work one day each week to come up with the remaining amount in spending reduction needed to reach our goal for the year i stressed that i was agreeing to this only on a temporary basis in the even that the switch was as painful a change as i feared it would be i wanted the opportunity to come up with a different means of meeting the budget goal
6739812 i ended up enjoying the brown bag lunch experience better than i expected as well i liked to use my lunch breaks to read and not having to leave the office and wait in line at a sandwich shop gave me more time for it i ended up taking a brown bag lunch all five working days instead of just one saving about 30 a week or 1 560 a year

6739814 nationally prices are probably pretty overvalued by about 10 percent
6739815 further weaken the housing market and prolong the downturn there
6739816 more people out of work is going to put more pressure on people being able to pay their mortgages so thats going to lead to more foreclosures and more people walking away from their houses
6739817 theres no rush for anyone to buy in now or even when we see the signs of a housing bottom
6739818 a better value now than it was a year ago
6739819 still above the historic average which means that houses are expensive relative to apartments
6739820 weve had boomers accumulating multiple housing or rental houses on the expectation that housing was a one way ticket up and that belief has been shattered
6739821 if youre buying to live in a house its probably ok to purchase a house now

6739829 we thought it was a good idea to have this program throughout the county so romeoville chief andy barto and i went to a crimestoppers board meeting to propose this and found them very supportive
6739830 it is important to get a handle on this problem to prevent future accidents and crime
6739831 youll hear all kinds of criticism that buybacks are ineffective in reducing violent crime but theres no way to tell what positives can come from this
6739832 theres got to be a case out there where a gun that was turned in couldve easily ended up in the hands of a criminal

6739891 its just huge disappointment now we came up with ambitions of winning and getting to an all ireland final it just didnt work out for us on the day maybe they just worked that little bit harder and we didnt have the answers we were saying beforehand that waterford were after losing the last couple of years and they werent going to go down without a fight they werent going to let us have it our way they stood up and came at us and fair play to them theyve got to an all ireland final we wish them the best of luck against kilkenny
6739892 the start they had was unbelievable they went six points up at one stage i dont know what it was with us maybe it was the occasion we knew theyd have runs at us in stages of the game but we thought wed be able to come back at them and we did do that in all fairness we were level at halftime and it was only a very small thing separated us in the end even when they got the goal we came back down the other end and got a goal ourselves i guess waterford just pulled it out in the last few minutes its desperate disappointing for us the dressing room is very low we came up to win its as simple as that were fairly shell shocked
6739893 we came up with the intention of winning but what can we do only take our hats off to waterford
6739894 the government has spooked everyone into thinking that we need nuclear by saying theres going to be a terrible energy gap the lights are going to go out in the middle of the next decade
6739895 theres actually no evidence thats the case at all theyve raised the wrong problem in order to push the wrong solution
6739896 the real problem is that our energy mix is not green enough and were over dependent on oil and gas from parts of the world that arent very reliable
6739897 brick walsh who will lead out the team against the cats on september 7th
6739898 to be without the liam mccarthycup foralmosthalf a century is a mortal sin for a county of our proud hurling tradition says walsh
6739899 this present team however showedlastsundaythatithas what it takes to be a winner andwhilekilkennywillbethe red hot favourites to make it three in a row we have every chance of going all the way
6739900 ill be the happiest water ford man around if that tag of being the countys last all ireland winning skipper is taken away from me by
6739901 its not that they players havent been up for the job until now said flynn
6739902 every able bodied person of every age group will want to be there on the day but the reality is that not all of them will be able to be accommodated with tickets pat flynn said
6739903 it will be a headache for sure but a headache well be more than happy to have
6739904 the boys are winning the frees its easy enough to hit them over i wasnt really happy with my first half performance there were a couple of shots easy shots i should have put over the lads have been great all year especially john mullane and eoin mcgrath on either side theyve been winning a lot of frees everyone is just playing well at the moment i dont know if its experience or just hard work but we spoke a lot about it about just working hard we never spoke about having been here five times before or being beaten five times no point in talking about that we just said wed work hard from the first minute to the 73rd the 74th dont look at the scoreboard just keep working and thats what we did
6739905 in the last couple of games we werent working hard enough you look at kilkenny last week against cork they were unbelievable their blocking down their harassing of the cork forwards they are the benchmark
6739906 i suppose it looks like it we didnt like to do what we did justin is a nice man a good hurling man no one liked doing what we did we felt we were just missing that little something to reach an all ireland final something we didnt feel we were going to get from justin there are lads in their 30s who have never played in an all ireland final we just felt we needed a something little different
6739907 it hasnt sunk it yet weve been trying for so long it probably wont hit us til during the week the one thing i hope is that it doesnt bypass us now were in the final we havent been there for so long but theres no point going there just to make up the numbers
6739908 this is what dreams are made of that was a performance and a half to be honest with you and im just delighted for the players and everyone connected with waterford hurling
6739909 for so long we have failed at the semi final stage and to finally witnesses scenes like this its unbelievable just look around this is what water ford people so deserve and all i can roll on a crack at the cats on final day
6739910 the hill just went mad there were so much embracing tears hugs celebrations and even a few kisses flying around but most importantly for me looking out on the field this bunch of players who have stuck together through thick and thin finally got their just reward here today every single player on the pitch played and wore the waterford jersey with passion and pride and thats what carried us over the winning line davy fitz is now a true legend and maybe now eoin kelly will get what would be a richly deserved hurler of the year accolade
6739911 i knew we could do it if we picked the right team and thats exactly what we did its a great day for waterford hurling and a great day for the players
6739912 this is unbelievable the passion commitment will to win and the desire i tell you this group of players have stood up and answered the critics in style its a wonderful day a wonderful achievement and i see no reason why we cant overcome the challenge of kilkenny but i think for me the one players that really showed the true character of this team was eoin murphy he was immense took a dreadful blow in a tackle with lar corbett but he picked himself up and held the great eoin kelly of tipperary to a single point amazing performance
6739913 ive been following water ford hurling for 35 years and this is a very special moment i never thought in my heart of hearts that i would see our senior hurlers play in an all ireland final its brilliant its brilliant for the players management county board and fans its a great day for waterford a day that weve looked forward to for a long time and now roll on the all ireland final
6739914 when the final whistle sounded i just had to look at the scoreboard to make sure we had won
6739915 over the last number of years weve spoke about how this moment must feel like and i can tell you now its unbelievable to be finally in an all ireland final is amazing but i think that to finally see this group of play ers get the chance to prove that they are the best in the country over the last number of years its something that money just cant buy and something most importantly that they so deserve they have called john kiely a messiah in waterford well i think that we can now call davy fitz one too
6739916 ive waited twelve long years for this day to arrive and now that it has finally come im just finding it difficult to sink in
6739917 hurler of the year dan shanahan who while not among the scorers in his sides exhilarating win over tipperary epitomised the unyielding spirit that now sweeps through the team
6739918 this victory and the prize it has brought with it is just unbelievable and for myself personally it is the greatest day of sporting life shanahan said
6739919 i have no doubt too that it is the same for every member of my family
6739920 yes it could have gone any way in that thrilling finale he said
6739921 the two eoins kelly dans first cousin and mcgrath were magic and all of john mullanes points were pure class with forwards of their ability in the side everything and anything is possible he said
6739922 we will play right to the end whatever the situation
6739923 i dont think we need worry in that regard however he added
6739924 he came to us under difficult circumstances but what he has achieved in a matter of ten weeks or less has been incredible said dan
6739925 he has thrown himself headlong into the job he is totally focussed on what he wants and what he wants us to achieve and if he says we are a great bunch of players then i have no difficulty in saying he is a very special hurling manager
6739926 its a tag weve never comfortably carried ourselves and sure being the outsiders didnt do us one bit of harm today he said
6739927 the all important thing is that we keep our feet firmly on the ground in the next few weeks and sure threes no better man than davy to make sure that we do so
6739928 nothing ever becomes real till it is experienced even a proverb is no proverb to you till your life has illustrated it

6739936 in the simplest terms we mean the belief that america has been and continues to be bad for the world anti americanism is a multi faceted phenomenon it can be expressed in racist terms about american people in the view that america is a uniquely unpleasant society or in the attitude that american power and influence play a mostly negative part in global affairs some of these anti american positions are legitimate points of view it is not racist to think america has done more harm than good but we seek to show that such views are profoundly mistaken q are you saying it is anti american to oppose the policies of the current american government a no of course it is possible to oppose the government of a country while believing that the country is nonetheless good for the world but that is the point do all of those who say they are anti bush rather than anti american actually think america plays a positive role in global affairs do they welcome americas influence or would they like it to be diminished again the latter is a legitimate and we believe false position to hold just as it is legitimate to think that the european union or united nations are bad for the world but it is an anti american position just as those positions are anti eu and anti un

6739940 as soon as the issue was brought to our attention we removed the product from the shelves in order to return it to the supplier
6739941 the product is imported in a closed package from the manufacturer in holland we turned to the company that provided us with tattoos that were added to the clear packaging
6739942 as a result of complaints that the tattoos have pictures of swastikas we stopped the distribution and sent our workers out to the stores to remove the packages from the shelves we apologize to our customers for their distress

6739958 we want to throw the ball around i want the players to enjoy it and the supporters to enjoy our type of rugby
6739959 but to do that we must dominate the first phase we did that at newlands where our lineouts and scrums were good the players decision making then comes into play
