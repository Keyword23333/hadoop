8910041 upon contacting the resident by phone because no one would come to the door stephanie one of our acos felt she was being given the run around
8910042 after listening in on the end of the conversation i felt non truths were being told on the part of the resident so we made an unexpected drop in and made some noise rattled some bushes and got a very sweet woman to peer over the fence at us
8910043 long and short the lady had gotten in over her head
8910044 they all seem very sweet though not terribly social and all but two seem relatively healthy
8910045 i would elaborate and be more colorful in my plea for help but honestly im exhausted any help in placing these precious pekingese pups in suitable homes will be appreciated by our entire staff small as it may be
8910046 we are a small shelter we have 10 dog runs and we are short an officer so these pups are on the clock
8910047 i took him to a shelter the next day in the hope of reuniting him with his family boy was i naive follow up calls to the shelter revealed that no only was he never claimed but he was about to be euthanized this was too much to bear especially since i was the one responsible for putting him on death row needless to say i went and picked him up and brought him home
8910048 he is very smart and extremely trainable my husband helped him overcome his food aggression and now he eats in the kitchen alongside our other two dogs weve taken him to pool parties where he is good with children adults and other dogs he loves to fetch lay in the grass and play with stuffed animals

8910119 het zou geen regel moeten zijn het druist in tegen het overheidsbeleid dat de concurrentie en het gebruik van lokale alternatieven juist moet stimuleren het is echt absurd
8910120 vaak worden straffen in het contract ingebouwd waardoor er binnen de grenzen van de service level agreements afspraken worden nagekomen maar veelal niet meer dan dat buiten de grenzen van wat op papier staat zal niet al te snel gekeken worden waardoor outsourcing toch beklemmend kan werken voor organisaties hoe komen we tot een partnership tussen leverancier en klant waarbij de leverancier net dat stapje extra zet om de klant volledig tevreden te maken en houden mijn visie is dat positief gedrag belonen op de lange termijn beter werkt dan negatief gedrag afstraffen kijkend naar outsourcingscontracten kan dit leiden tot een interessante discussie want hoe ga je er als klant voor zorgen dat de sourcer de stap extra zet om extra beloond te worden
8910121 ict is een belangrijke enabler van bedrijfsdoelen een ict outsourcingscontract moet daarom als uitgangspunt het opbouwen van een partnerrelatie hebben waarin beide partijen het voordeel hebben wanneer de resultaten goed zijn financieel gewin is natuurlijk een goede drijfveer en contracten die dat als uitgangspunt hanteren zijn een interessante manier om de financi le consequenties voor beide partners vast te leggen ik zou echter ook andere wederzijdse beloningen willen voorstellen denk eens na over een managementuitwisselingsprogramma of een uitwisseling van bedrijfskennis zodat leverancier en klant elkaars markt beter begrijpen de klant kan ook als actieve referent optreden of bijvoorbeeld als tegenprestatie haar core activiteiten inzetten om de outsourcer van dienst te zijn een dergelijke reciprociteit bespreken tijdens de eerste fase van de relatie brengt de kernwaarden van afnemer en leverancier dichter bij elkaar en dat is een prima basis voor een partnerschap die meer is dan een financi le relatie gebaseerd op boete en beloning
8910122 belonen werkt beter dan straffen helemaal mee eens vergeet daarbij vooral ook niet rechtstreeks de mensen te belonen die de diensten daadwerkelijk leveren dus eens wat vaker een pluim geven een schouderklop dat is vaak effectiever dan welke contractstructuur dan ook maar ook contractueel is er een heel concrete beloningsmanier voor leveranciers spreek een bonusregeling af die besteed wordt aan gezamenlijke innovatieve projecten dat draagt daadwerkelijk bij aan een concreet partnership
8910123 uiteraard is het altijd prettig voor klanten dat zij worden bediend door een leverancier die doet wat wordt gevraagd meedenkt met de gestelde eisen en wensen en pro actief met suggesties komt voor verbetering en toekomstige scenarios een daadwerkelijk partnership zoals voorgesteld kent zeker voordelen in grotere uitbestedingssituaties zo kan een leverancier niet alleen op prijs maar ook op omvang cultuur en type werknemer die aansluit bij de klantorganisatie worden geselecteerd ook worden bij het afsluiten van slas heldere afspraken over omvang periodiciteit en inhoud van rapportages gemaakt en deze worden besproken in periodieke overleggen tevens zit in slas de mogelijkheid voor het laten uitvoeren van een beoordeling naar de kwaliteit van dienstverlening door een derde partij eventueel middels een sas 70 verklaring danwel third party mededeling zo wordt voldaan aan de randvoorwaarden om te komen tot een daadwerkelijk partnership en een succesvolle uitbestedingsrelatie
8910124 klanten moeten de service levels vastleggen die nodig zijn voor hun bedrijfsvoering klanten willen niet betalen voor hogere dan de afgesproken service levels deze wijze van belonen is daarmee niet het juiste instrument negatieve sancties zoals boetes zijn slechts een uiterst middel en werken vrij simpel hoe hoger de boete hoe meer aandacht uitgaat naar die klant het biedt klanten dus zekerheid dat een leverancier zijn verplichtingen zal nakomen belangrijk nadeel van het boetesysteem is dat deze verzekeringspremie veelal verdisconteerd wordt in de prijs de klant betaalt dus zelf voor de zekerheid wat werkt dan wel resultaatverplichtingen en bonus malus afspraken daarnaast is het belangrijk dat klanten in het rfp proces de slagkracht van de voorgestelde servicemanager beoordelen hoe succesvol is de servicemanager geweest bij andere klanten organiseer een intake voor de contractondertekening is deze servicemanager de persoon die bij zijn directie de kastanjes uit het vuur gaat halen voor jou
8910125 ik kan het wel mee eens zijn om dienstverleners te binden aan de klant het realiseren in de praktijk zal zeer moeilijk of niet mogelijk blijken naar mijn mening in een enkel geval heb ik het begin van een dergelijke constructie zien werken het betrof hier situaties waarin bedrijven voor een groot deel afhankelijk zijn van de door de leverancier geleverde prestatie voorbeeld hiervan zijn bedrijven die voor hun bedrijfsvoering geheel afhankelijk zijn van het internet en hun techniek afnemen bij een internet service provider in die gevallen is het mogelijk gebleken om een koppeling te maken tussen het succes van de klant en de leverancier tot beider tevredenheid in specifieke gevallen zou het dus kunnen werken ik denk daarbij vooral aan situaties waarbij n leverancier betrokken is als er meerdere leveranciers betrokken zijn die allemaal een deel van de informatieketen beheren wordt het naar mijn idee onmogelijk
8910126 als klant in een uitbestedingsituatie ben je op zoek naar een antwoord op je probleem dit antwoord wordt je in principe gegeven door de leverancier die jou zijn diensten aanbiedt beide partijen zijn erbij gebaat dat je als klant tevreden bent realiseer je dat er een gezamenlijk belang bestaat het draagt sterk bij tot wederzijds begrip je kunt kiezen voor een zuiver financi le beloning die voor de kwaliteit van de relatie weinig zoden aan de dijk zet een meer creatieve benadering is de afspraak dat je als klant bij het behalen van het goede resultaten meewerkt aan een publicatie van een artikel van de leverancier in een gerenommeerd vakblad een dergelijke exposure benadrukt de samenwerking op doeltreffende wijze als leverancier kun je betrokkenheid demonstreren door je actief te verdiepen in de veranderingsprocessen van de klant en realiseert waar hij naar toe wil en dat je dit actief ondersteunt
8910127 het klinkt paradoxaal enerzijds strakke afgesproken slas en kpis met boete clausules en anderzijds het stapje meer doen in ruil voor klanttevredenheid en partnership positief belonen werkt beter dan enkel het afstraffen van underperformance mijn mening is echter wel dat slas slechts de kaders vormen van een samenwerkingsmodel de mensen die verantwoordelijk zijn voor de uitvoering maken het verschil bij outsourcing werkt het niet anders waarom zitten er in nog zo weinig bpo contracten een klanttevredenheidscijfer als kpi dit geeft onschatbare informatie om te komen tot het verder verfijnen van de outsourcingsrelatie mogelijk zijn servcice levels wel in de contractfase te nauw geformuleerd waardoor er klantontevredenheid optreedt daarom is het inbouwen van evaluatiemomenten gericht op kwaliteit performance en gedrag essentieel om te komen tot een outsourcingrelatie die toekomst heeft dit geeft onschatbare informatie die op zijn beurt weer leiden tot het gezamenlijk kunnen aanpakken van punten ter verbetering
8910128 van etten heeft een interessante discussie geopend over de relatie tussen opdrachtgever en opdrachtnemer een nauwe relatie tussen opdrachtgever en opdrachtnemer wil iedereen nastreven iedere opdrachtnemer zal willen bijdragen aan het succes van opdrachtgever immers als het de opdrachtgever voor de wind gaat zal dat op den duur vanzelf leiden tot meer uitbesteding bij de opdrachtnemer maar partijen zouden vooral ge nteresseerd moeten zijn in een positieve reclame over elkaar in plaats van een financi le vergoeding zou het een win win situatie voor beide partijen opleveren als de nauwe relatie tot extra klanten leidt aan beide kanten gesprekken tussen partijen zouden voor een deel hierop gericht moeten zijn hoe kunnen we elkaar helpen serieus oog voor elkaars belang op commercieel gebied leidt tot een bestendige relatie
8910129 van etten heeft zeer beslist een punt iemand belonen heeft een positiever effect dan straffen dit hoeft echter niet meteen over te gaan in partnerships te vaak en te snel wordt gekeken naar partnerships maar welk bedrijfsrisico of strategische waarde wordt er dan ingebracht door de dienstverlener wat is er toch mis met een leverancier die zijn best doet om de dienstverlening op een zo hoog mogelijk niveau te krijgen we moeten uitkijken dat er geen symptoombestrijding gaat plaatsvinden leveranciers halen net de sla norm of net niet en om ze in beweging te krijgen moeten er gekunstelde partnerships worden overeengekomen waarom moet de leverancier die desktops beheert ineens een partner worden welke toegevoegde waarde anders dan dat het gereedschap werkt biedt hij nu hetzelfde geldt voor de applicatiebeherende partijen gelukkig zijn er wel dienstverleners die begrijpen dat ze leverancier zijn en ook trots zijn op deze status

8910239 this is great news for stroke survivors because results clearly demonstrate that long term stroke damage is not immutable and that with exercise its never too late for the brain and body to recover
8910240 this suggests that the brain is responsible for the improvement we saw in patients walking ability it seems to be recruiting other regions to take on the job of areas damaged by stroke
8910241 many stroke survivors believe theres nothing to be gained from further rehabilitation but our results suggest that health and functional benefits from walking on a treadmill can occur even decades out from stroke

8910295 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8910296 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8910297 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8910298 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8910299 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8910300 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8910301 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8910302 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8910303 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8910304 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8910305 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8910306 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8910307 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8910308 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8910309 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8910310 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8910311 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8910312 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8910313 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8910314 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8910315 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8910316 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8910317 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8910318 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8910319 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

8910321 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8910322 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8910323 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8910324 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8910325 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8910326 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8910327 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8910328 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8910329 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8910330 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8910331 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
8910332 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
8910333 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8910334 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8910335 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8910336 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8910337 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8910338 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8910339 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8910340 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8910341 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8910342 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8910343 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

8910347 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8910348 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8910349 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8910350 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8910351 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8910352 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8910353 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8910354 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8910355 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8910356 esta nova uni o ir trazer bastante entretenimento e gloria ao pa s
8910357 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8910358 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8910359 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8910360 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8910361 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8910362 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8910363 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8910364 their verdict means that you in a calm and calculated manner poured petrol over her and then deliberately set fire to her intending that she should be caused really serious injury
8910365 this was an unbelievably vicious and cruel thing to have done to another human being no matter what the motivation
8910366 sadly she could not have been more wrong because on the 23 july you made a shocking and chilling decision that would have catastrophic effects and would ruin her life forever
8910367 during the course of the day you contacted her and told her that when you got home you were going to light her up
8910368 when you got home having obviously given the matter very serious thought you set about carrying out your act of revenge
8910369 i cant sleep at night i have flashbacks of gary standing there doing absolutely nothing to help me there are days where i feel so low i want to end my own life
8910370 i am sure that neither of them will fully recover emotionally from the shock of what you did
8910371 i accept that after you had set fire to her and quite possibly because you were shocked at the ferocity of the human fireball that you had created you tried to put her out and received significant injuries yourself in so doing
8910372 the coincidence of a major new report on road noise which identifies the damaging effects of the loss of tranquillity and the presentation of tranquillity mapping to an international audience is the clearest possible sign that this is an urgent issue for all decision makers
8910373 it is becoming ever clearer that the quality of our environment is vital to our health and well being tranquillity is a key measure of that quality
8910374 but so far with transport policy the government and its advisers including the planning inspectorate are woefully silent on the issue
8910375 we need the department for transport and other decision makers to wake up to this urgent problem and catch up with progressive thinking

8910402 separation of union and non union production employees will be permanent and will result in the elimination of all production operations at the remaining coshocton facility
8910403 i think it was cut and dried but we tried
8910404 we are proud and excited to have an opportunity like this in a difficult economy and a struggling local job market
8910405 one of the main reasons we were selected was the tremendous experience of our workforce which averages over 22 years on the job
8910406 we went through a rigorous inspection quoting process and online auction but with the help of local lee wayne employees bernie white and carol boucha assisting and cheering us on we were able to succeed in securing the business
8910407 it is a good way to excite the community for the fundraiser
8910408 and a great way to say thank you to everyone who helps
8910409 this is an important event because the community can use all the positive upbeat fun group type family friendly where good food is involved working for the common good events that we can get
8910410 this is great there are all kinds of people here usually you see certain groups but this is everyone
8910411 but he really liked the deep dish pizza from east of chicago
8910412 this is a great community event we really like this area

8910416 the united way does a lot of things that we are a part of we cant expect anyone to use our services if we dont support theirs

8910419 the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals
8910420 they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america

8910423 ohio is the most important state in the country this fall
8910424 something ive lived through three times in my career now
8910425 whereas traditional software is like cocaine youre hooked its too difficult and expensive to switch providers once youve invested in one if it were easier to jump ship a lot of people wouldve hit the eject button on sap a long time ago
8910426 the saas hype is based on one company in the software industry having modest success salesforce com just has average to below average profitability
8910427 the success of salesforce com in my opinion has to do with their product being good not because its saas
8910428 we are thrilled with the current momentum and will continue to lead the industry with our primary focus on email by bringing the most innovative products to our customers
8910429 email is recognized as a mission critical business tool yet many organizations still struggle to keep their email systems safe secure and easy to use with the ongoing threat of data leakage the need to archive email and increasing spam and virus attacks companies need to make email infrastructure protection a top priority whether it be with an on premise solution a saas deployment or a hybrid approach it is now more crucial than ever that email is secure from inbound and outbound threats
8910430 the cfo plays an important role in todays business environment and we are pleased to have someone of allans caliber as a member of our team not only to serve todays needs but as an integral element in our planning for the future
8910431 i am pleased to report that selectcore is not only delivering solid revenue growth but also a healthy improvement in gross profit
8910432 we expect this growth to continue based on the increasing demand for our proprietary point of sale activation posa solution
8910433 there is a lot of talk about an impending federal election if you are one of the countless canadians who wants an answer to why working people dont get their priorities dealt with or why our jobs are not being protected why theres still a shortage of affordable child care and why women still earn just 701 2 cents for every dollar men get when they work think about who you need to vote for to finally make your priorities the priorities of your government
8910434 once they see who their voters are and what the real issues are the choice is clear for any elected official represent the people who vote for you or get replaced by somebody else who will do a better job
8910435 imagine what else is possible if more working people did the same thing from now on
8910436 we could change our country for the better and have a canada that works for working men working women and our families
8910437 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8910438 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8910439 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8910440 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8910441 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8910442 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8910443 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8910444 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8910445 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8910446 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8910447 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8910448 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8910449 senator obama this is truly a good day for america

8910452 top us and pakistani army commanders had a highly unusual secret meeting on board an american aircraft carrier in the indian ocean to discuss how to combat the escalating violence along the border between afghanistan and pakistan the leading actors in the day long conference were admiral mike mullen chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and pakistan army chief general ashfaq pervez kayani the meeting had been convened on tuesday august 26 by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff while officials of the two allies offered few details on wednesday about what was decided or even discussed at the meeting including any new strategies tactics weapons or troop deployment the star studded list of participants and an extreme secrecy surrounding the talks underscored how gravely the two nations regarded the growing militant threat
8910453 according to a thread on the bind users mailing list there is nothing inherent in the dns protocol that would cause the massive vulnerability

8910463 in the event that conditions worsen beyond our forecast the regulator could lower the excess requirement further such that the minimum requirement again becomes the binding constraint
8910464 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8910465 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8910466 who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8910467 no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him
8910468 all i want is for lindsay to be healthy and in a good relationship
8910469 i want her to use the gifts she has in the best ways and to help others i said it from the very beginning show me who you walk with and i will tell you who you are people may deceive us but our eyes and facts dont open your eyes
8910470 what many nervous democrats were hoping for a forceful challenge to john mccain and the republicans and a restatement of the message to change washington and the nation that propelled him to the nomination
8910471 unquestionably confronted two of his greatest challenges one was to help voters in emotion laden language to connect his promise of change to more earthly policy proposals
8910472 the other to show he could take the fight to mccain over mr obamas own image and the best way forward for the nation
8910473 was a desperately needed opportunity to relaunch his campaign and redefine his image
8910474 a sharp edged almost populist economic message aimed directly at the middle income voters who have been reluctant to sign up for his crusade
8910475 filled with promises of generational change and a better america
8910476 proved the greatest testament yet to the intensity of barack obamas support and the enthusiasm for his candidacy that his party hopes will carry him to the white house
8910477 said the crowd of 80 000 came tonight because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight
8910478 opened up an important and legitimate debate the republicans will carry on about issues
8910479 as a speech i was deeply impressed in many ways it was less a speech than a symphony
8910480 transformational speech maybe the greatest ive ever heard at a convention since kennedy
8910481 vote for him or do not but take pride that this nation can produce men and speakers such as that
8910482 i have been to eight conventions i have never seen a convention where there are more people standing throughout the entire speech because they felt this was so historic so special
8910483 direct assault on john mccains campaign slogan was effective he said i got news for you we all put our country first that is mccains slogan country first by directly confronting it obama is now challenging mccain are you saying that not only do you disagree with me but i barack obama and those that are with me here dont put country first i think thats a tough challenge for mccain
8910484 obama had to negotiate a fine line the throng in denvers football stadium was eagerly awaiting the eloquence and idealism that propelled him to the pinnacle of national politics at the same time he had to counter the republicans caricature of those qualities as nothing more than the callow charisma of a political rock star to a considerable extent obama accomplished that feat
8910485 one test of a presidential candidates strength and often his best shot at winning is how much he can mold his party in his image and rally it around a powerful argument for his election
8910486 left no doubt of his commitment one that we share to vigorous international engagement the fight against terrorism and the urgency of promoting prosperity in the developing world
8910487 helped himself thursday night but if the polls are right hell need to build his case further during the next nine weeks if he is to become the first black president not just the first black nominee
8910488 i completely disagree with bill kristol i thought it was a lost opportunity i was thinking how many times have i heard this same speech over 20 years
8910489 obama whose campaign theme is change we can believe in promised thursday to spell out exactly what that change would mean but instead of dwelling on specifics he laced the crowning speech of his long campaign with the type of rhetorical flourishes that republicans mock and the attacks on mccain that democrats cheer
8910490 fell short of the expectation he would be workmanlike and very specific about helping the middle class
8910491 speech before 85 000 at invesco field was as much coronation as nomination yet for someone who is so close to being the most powerful man in the world the remarkable fact is that americans still know very little about either his political philosophy or what he wants to accomplish
8910492 added detail and context to his policies thursday some of his criticism of john mccain could have used some too
8910493 obama transcended politics on thursday in accepting his partys nomination for president during an event that played out on television like a combination of a rock concert and super bowl
8910494 in the end the stadium was a gamble that worked the size of the venue brought out the bigness in the speakers rather than dwarfing them
8910495 this was barack obamas big night and it was the nations big night too one of those times that watching the screen you may have felt a connection to all the other millions of viewers watching in all the other millions of homes
8910496 brought the crowd to its feet many times to cheer and applaud but perhaps just as importantly for audiences back home for almost 50 minutes he silenced the ceaseless chatter of television anchors and commentators who had insistently put their own stamp and faces on one of the most exciting political conventions in modern times
8910497 also serves to take attention away from sen mccains birthday
8910498 will hold a noontime rally with his running mate today in dayton ohio kicking off his road to the convention tour in front of thousands of supporters at wright state university the identity of mccains partner remained secret last night even as mccains campaign arrived in the crucial battleground state in advance of the rally which will be followed by appearances at minor league baseball stadiums in pennsylvania and missouri
8910499 never mind history in the making its all about news cycles that was the import of rumors circulating today that the mccain campaign would try to crash the obama party or at least steal away with some airtime with a leak of the republicans choice of a running mate it was either tactically clever or foolish but theres no denying that it ate up some of the airtime rightfully due to obama
8910500 said yesterday that they are considering delaying the start of the gop convention
8910501 white house officials are also debating whether president bush should cancel his scheduled convention appearance on monday the first day of the convention according to administration officials and others familiar with the discussion
8910502 the publics attention away from sen mccains agenda and the celebration in st paul instead gustav cant help but remind voters of the last time a natural disaster befell a republican administration and the faltering response that ensued democrats are keen to make the connection
8910503 privately top republican officials acknowledge a real sensitivity about the administrations response to hurricane katrina and the image of republicans partying in st paul as another hurricane comes ashore on the gulf coast is a real potential political problem that has sparked many closed door meetings
8910504 the question now is whether it lasts and if so for how long the next question is whether sen john mccain gets a smaller bigger or similar bounce from his vice presidential nominee selection and his convention that starts almost as soon as the democratic convention ends
8910505 opens a stretch run toward election day in which sen obama will try to capitalize on the most positive backdrop for democrats in years yet he must confront challenges that no presidential contender has ever faced
8910506 has to win over more working class white voters and turn out all those young voters who say they are for him in the eyes of many in his party he also must shed some of the cool facade that makes some voters see him as aloof and he must zero in on the key handful of normally republican red states he can turn democratic blue
8910507 are launching their general election campaign this weekend with a bus tour of battleground states the mode of transportation is also appropriate for a swing through working class territory that will highlight bidens ability to attract voters who didnt support obama in the primary
8910508 sprint to the election finish line to unleash a hard hitting campaign attack that casts republican opponent sen john mccain as a well heeled aging war hero who is out of touch with most americans
8910509 is weighing an executive order that would eliminate a union preferred method of labor organizing at large government contractors according to people familiar with the situation labor leaders prefer a card check system in which workers can form a union if a majority of them sign a union authorization card companies generally prefer a secret ballot election
8910510 the executive order would require large government contractors to use secret ballot elections for union organizing or risk losing government contracts say people familiar with the order
8910511 grew much faster in the second quarter than first reported economists had predicted gross domestic product growth for the second quarter of 2 7 per cent
8910512 thanks to stronger exports and healthier business inventory figures thursdays revised figure rose to an annualised rate of 3 3 per cent
8910513 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8910514 forecasters say gdp could decrease again in the fourth quarter of this year as global demand for us products slows and the american consumer cuts back on spending
8910515 helped boost consumer spending compared with the previous quarter but wont be available to sustain it going forward
8910516 slowing growth abroad could temper what has been a rapid rise in exports
8910517 the report from the commerce department also suggested that the health of american businesses has become heavily dependent on customers abroad
8910518 the economy pulled out of a dangerous rough patch in the spring thanks largely to strong exports the rebound isnt expected to last
8910519 economic slowdowns overseas could make exports tail off just as americans are hunkering down after the bracing impact of rebate checks wanes plunging the country into another rut later this year
8910520 the number of people signing up for jobless benefits declined last week the third straight drop from a six year high reached earlier this month applications for unemployment benefits dropped to a seasonally adjusted 425 000 down 10 000 from the previous week the labor department reported that was a slightly better figure than the 427 000 analysts expected
8910521 wall street barreled higher thursday after a better than expected reading on the gross domestic product and a drop in jobless claims gave investors some reassurance that the economy is holding up the dow rose 212 67 or 1 85 percent to 11 715 18 bringing its three day advance to nearly 330 points still for the week the dow is up only slightly after a big decline monday on credit worries
8910522 advanced 19 02 or 1 48 percent to 1 300 68 and the nasdaq composite index rose 29 18 or 1 22 percent to 2 411 64
8910523 blamed the bush administration for failing to stop georgian leaders from launching the aug 7 attack on the breakaway province of south ossetia that sparked the war
8910524 that the us policy of training and supplying weapons to the georgian army had emboldened the country to abandon long standing negotiations over the future of south ossetia and to try instead to seize the region by force
8910525 suggested that us military advisers were working with georgian forces that clashed with the russian army
8910526 a color copy of what he said was a us passport found in a basement in a village in south ossetia among items that belonged to georgian forces
8910527 suggested that the bush administration may have tried to create a crisis that would influence american voters in the choice of a successor to president bush
8910528 did not specify which candidate he had in mind but there was no doubt that he was referring to senator john mccain
8910529 is loathed in the kremlin because he has a close relationship
8910530 the latest sign of escalating tensions between moscow and washington
8910531 has placed under review talks with moscow focused on missile defense and nuclear weapons disarmament
8910532 had been planning a round of talks tentatively expected for mid september
8910533 imminent collapse of the nuclear deal once a top bush priority
8910534 represents the most tangible casualty so far of the deteriorating relations with russia it also would mean unraveling an initiative that was critical to mr bushs vision of safely spreading civilian nuclear energy around the world a program that relied in part on russian involvement
8910535 formally barred prosecutors from pressuring companies and individuals under investigation to waive legal protections
8910536 intended to assuage criticism that prosecutors have unfairly wielded the threat of criminal charges against companies to pressure them during investigations of company employees
8910537 the shift is a victory for the u s chamber of commerce the american bar association and other groups that have spent more than three years arguing that the justice department tactics violated employees constitutional rights and gave prosecutors unfair leverage to force settlements with companies
8910538 whether justice anticipated its legal defeat before the surrender is less important than the fact that it has now restored a measure of due process fairness to corporate defendants and their employees
8910539 did you see that mount olympus style backdrop they had for baracks speech with the big columns on it little over the top do you think huh like when they introduced him as barack son of zeus that seemed over the top
8910540 at one point this week police in denver had a showdown with over 300 protestors ended up pepper spraying them and since of course it was denver and they were democrats it was only fresh ground pepper spray
8910541 well there was a rumor that mccain might pick former ebay ceo meg whitman as his running mate that makes sense you know shes an expert at selling americans really old stuff

8910549 am anfang habe ich viele ver nderungen an der mannschaft vorgenommen doch jetzt haben wir eine relativ stabile anfangsformation gefunden
8910550 eine ganze reihe junger talente hat den sprung ins nationalteam geschafft in dem allerdings auch erfahrene spieler weiterhin ihre schl sselrollen spielen
8910551 als ich 1998 als trainer chinas arbeitete gab es dort keine auslandslegion re es mangelte einfach an selbstvertrauen doch nach einigen guten ergebnissen beispielsweise einem sieg gegen japan in der ostasien meisterschaft eaff gab es einige viel beachtete transfers von spielern wie fan zhiyi und sun jihai die zu europ ischen klubs wechselten
8910552 wir haben sehr viele wirklich talentierte spieler wie sunil chetri der durchaus das potenzial hat sich einen transfer nach europa zu verdienen
8910553 wir m ssen daf r sorgen dass die inder daran glauben dass ihre spieler es schaffen k nnen

8910567 my proposal for the book that became remembering the bone house created a little flurry culminating in an advance of 52 500 from harper amp row this was by far the biggest advance i have ever had but i regretted the choice except for my editor and a liability lawyer no one ever read the book much less publicized it i felt i had caused tremendous disappointment as i felt after and so i felt more released than dismayed by the rejection of my proposal for ordinary time
8910568 the lessons of my writing career have proved pretty pedestrian
8910569 if you concentrate on the task at hand without aspiring to a particular outcome whether wealth literary acclaim or audience adoration something will happen i cant tell you whether it will be good but i can promise you that it will surprise you you just have to slog along

8910592 in the event that conditions worsen beyond our forecast the regulator could lower the excess requirement further such that the minimum requirement again becomes the binding constraint
8910593 this number seems to overstate the underlying strength even though exports are obviously strong
8910594 the details of the revision are not particularly supportive for growth
8910595 the strength of the economy in the second quarter suggested by the expenditure estimate of real gdp growth seems truly bizarre and is a product of a declining real trade gap
8910596 the upward revision to the advance q2 gdp estimate was even sharper than expected but probably doesnt change the outlook for this quarter very much with a substantial slowdown in overall growth still quite likely

8910600 luxury isnt getting a ton better but it is hanging in there people are going to remain concerned about what happens next given the state of the global economy and the global equity markets
8910601 the good news is that the sector is still outperforming others over the next two years
8910602 its just a matter of getting through the storm by focusing on the right markets the right suppliers and the right categories weve got to run a tighter smarter business
8910603 the biggest mistake luxury brands make is in not sticking with their core value system and core customer
8910604 i dont think you could say that by staying true a brand is guaranteed success however if they dont stay true success will be much more difficult to come by

8910608 however sales of silage stretchwrap have continued during july and august due to good growing conditions in the uk and scandinavia

8910664 rishi hein the hebrew school director is very progressive in her thinking and i really like the curriculum
8910665 i did take a look at other temples but i like their style they are going to connect content not just teach hebrew but teach the culture the history and incorporate it into real life
8910666 our goal is to educate jewish people as far as heritage our way of life and observance this is what we do and hebrew school is just another forum for doing that
8910667 the children who are currently enrolled happen to be affiliated with certain temples in the community
8910668 their parents just havent found a place for their child and maybe we are a better fit for their family or child were not here to take children out of other hebrew schools
8910669 its not as intensive we meet about once a month its not a hebrew program but more of a cultural education
8910670 we wanted tabetha to have more hebrew and more preparation for her bat mitzvah as well as a cultural education and i think chabad can accomplish that
8910671 we structure the lesson so children can actually relate to it
8910672 we bring it to their level with relevant personal examples and have them see things and hear things

8910697 but i had a power trio back in the 90s and we did go play something called the bulldog bash in the countryside in england which was like a three day biker festival for thousands and thousands of the hard core biker gangs all the way to yuppie london bikers and everything in between
8910698 he has a collection of beautiful motorcycles and he goes out and hes ridden all over the country
8910699 i have shots of bruce riding to clubs in new jersey on his harley davidson he rides a harley thats a fact they couldnt have done better i dont believe there will be a single person leaving that show unsatisfied
8910700 its just a perfect fit for harley davidson it fits that demographic and i think itll be a great show i just wish i could be there but i cant
8910701 i personally got on a couple when i was younger and put them right down into the pavement so i decided im a little too spaced out and theres too many notes running around in my brain for me to safely drive a harley
8910702 mainly the stages are so much bigger more for bruce
8910703 he runs out to the wings he puts up podiums out there and goes down and literally just throws himself into the audience no one does it better than bruce when i see him hoofing it out there to each side im glad its him and not me
8910704 the bands in fabulous shape offstage were like a m a s h unit now with the heating pads and pain shots and ice packs its hilarious how beat up we are but once we hit the stage were roaring
8910705 we loved danny i spent 25 years up on his drum riser playing with him i couldnt think of a better way to navigate a really depressing loss other than to have music to play
8910706 for 40 years people have been coming up and telling me they want to play rock guitar for fun but they have no talent and they have no rhythm so theyre not allowed to
8910707 i say look i dont know who told you that but its not true if you love music and you want to play for fun you just need a good teacher and a little time
8910708 theyre hour downloads and you can buy them every three weeks or whenever you need them every lesson im trying to show people something they can do with one finger that takes no practice that feels and sounds like music and they can play along with me on the video and have some fun

8910714 grunds tzlich begr en wir den einsatz zus tzlicher betreuungskr fte f r demenzkranke in pflegeheimen
8910715 die t tigkeit der pflegeassistenten kann ein wichtiger schritt zur st rkung und unterst tzung der sozialen betreuung demenzkranker in pflegeheimen sein und deren lebensqualit t nachhaltig verbessern
8910716 die betreuung von menschen mit erheblich eingeschr nkter alltagskompetenz ist eine sensible und anspruchsvolle aufgabe die schwierige betreuungssituation erfordert fundiertes fachliches wissen und eine zusammenarbeit im multiprofessionellen team
8910717 um einen fachkr ftemangel rechtzeitig abzuwenden muss daher in ausreichendem ma e pflegenachwuchs ausgebildet werden
8910718 der einsatz zus tzlicher betreuungskr fte kann lediglich der beginn einer verbesserten betreuung und versorgung sein
8910719 nur durch die fundierte ausbildung qualifizierung und f rderung von pflegefachkr ften kann die k nftige pflegerische versorgung eben auch der stark anwachsenden zahl demenzkranker auf sichere beine gestellt werden die politisch verantwortlichen stehen somit in der pflicht den pflegekr ftenachwuchs zu f rdern

8910737 there is now great industry support behind blu ray and the format is moving forward with enhancements that move beyond high definition such as the bd live spec that integrates internet connectivity options with the disc

8910787 the mask other examples of oceanic and african sculpture and works by artists including matisse modigliani cezanne and degas were collected by picasso and used as a stimulus and source of inspiration for ideas in his work
8910788 the headdress mask has also inspired two hands on art making activities that will be offered at kozan for children and families to enjoy

8910790 this decision effectively stops mr brandt from ever operating again as a real estate agent in queensland
8910791 mr brant had represented himself as a fully fledged real estate agent
8910792 this was simply not the case his licence was restricted and subject to the condition that he have no dealings with trust accounts
8910793 not only did he deal in trust accounts he also engaged in misleading conduct displaying a fraudulent real estate certificate on his wall
8910794 this is not accidental or incidental behaviour on the part of this individual
8910795 queenslanders deserve to know they are dealing with reputable agents
8910796 this decision is a clear reminder to all real estate agents to act responsibly
8910797 if an agent chooses to breach the law by deceiving their customers they risk the loss of their licence reputation and livelihood
8910798 the legislation is there to protect businesses and clients and must be complied with licensees caught doing the wrong thing will be penalised
8910799 mr springborg must come clean and tell public servants exactly which ones hes going to punt
8910800 im not sure where mr springborg got his attrition per centage because actual attrition averages more like 12 000 jobs
8910801 maybe its the springsure health care worker or the business services manager for the priority country area program
8910802 he glibly says no frontline people will be affected but hes cruelly unclear on which jobs gets cut
8910803 this stupidity has two clear downsides no support positions will place a greater burden on the lesser remaining staff and the frontline staff wont have the support they now have and need
8910804 he must tell queensland which jobs are expendable and then from what sectors and regions they will come from
8910805 its all so contradictory the opposition has called for full time teacher aides in prep classes this would require 640 full time people how do they provide these while cutting thousands of other jobs
8910806 his unthinking on the run stupidity shows an ignorance of how the public service operates
8910807 to the public servants especially those in support roles youre in the opposition crosshairs
8910808 i went to the 2006 election promising the people of gaven a new fire station and thats what the bligh government will deliver
8910809 a contract has now been signed clearing the way for the government to purchase land in beaudesert nerang road
8910810 securing the right parcel of land that was on the market has been a difficult process
8910811 im pleased that the queensland fire and rescue service will now acquire land that is deemed appropriate to meet operational demands for the area
8910812 while this process has taken some time it is very important that the fire station can be built on land best suited to the services operational needs
8910813 2 million has been allocated to the project this financial year for land purchase and the start of construction
8910814 im advised the tender process will begin in january with construction hopefully starting early to mid next year
8910815 this facility will provide important fire and rescue services to one of the states major growth areas
8910816 its great to see the ball rolling on this important emergency services infrastructure project
8910817 mr applegarth was admitted as a solicitor in 1983 and has been in full time practice as a barrister at the private bar since 1986 and is eminently qualified to take up this position
8910818 he was appointed senior counsel in 2000 and has practised in a wide range of civil and public law litigation
8910819 mr applegarth has also appeared before various commissions of inquiry including the fitzgerald inquiry and the commission of inquiry into queenslands public hospitals
8910820 in 2007 he chaired the marine board of inquiry into the abandonment of an ore carrier in the gulf of carpentaria during tropical cyclone nelson
8910821 earlier this year mr applegarth was appointed as a member of an expert panel chaired by the honourable glen williams ao qc to advise the bligh government on the establishment of a new civil and administrative tribunal for queensland
8910822 we have been fighting for this for the past five years
8910823 the howard government kept blocking our requests for a public interest monitor and wanted police to have unfettered powers
8910824 however we would not allow telephone tapping powers without the proper checks and balances
8910825 there is no doubt phone tapping is a highly effective law enforcement power
8910826 however it is also highly intrusive and needs appropriate safeguards for peoples privacy
8910827 in queensland our public interest monitor appears before judges when law enforcement agencies are applying for surveillance device warrants or covert search warrants
8910828 the public interest monitor is an independent barrister whose role in these applications is to represent the public interest by testing applications against the statutory criteria cross examining witnesses where necessary and making submissions to the judge
8910829 the rudd government have now agreed that the pim can be used for telephone tapping powers as well
8910830 this will ensure that an appropriate balance between law enforcement and privacy is maintained in the application process
8910831 queensland government officials will meet their federal counterparts next week to work through the complexities of the relevant state and federal legislation
8910832 once legislation has been amended telephone intercept powers will be able to be used for investigations into a range of serious crimes including homicides armed hold ups bikie gangs and drug crimes
8910833 with the inclusion of the pim we will strike the right balance between providing police with the necessary tools to fight crime and protecting peoples rights
8910834 the challenge will broaden the students horizons providing them with industry contacts and potentially open doors to careers in aviation
8910835 this year weve had enough students to sign up three teams to enter in the challenge one more than last year and this is a testament to the students keenness
8910836 all of the students have been working really hard meeting everyday for the past two months
8910837 there is always work for them to do on the uavs and this also allows them to be cross trained in all related roles
8910838 most importantly though they have been having fun they enjoy playing around with all the gadgets and especially love flying
8910839 we must make sure we provide culturally appropriate services and support to better engage indigenous australians and provide improvements to their experiences as consumers
8910840 governments have embraced the notion of a consistent nationally agreed approach to improving indigenous consumer affairs and this plan is the road map for success
8910841 kids under cover is an innovative not for profit organisation originating in victoria which has had a successful track record constructing purpose built accommodation to provide extra room for families who are confronting issues like homelessness breakdown or limited space
8910842 the organisation has now selected queensland as it embarks on a national expansion program to help young people at risk of becoming homeless to develop their independent living skills and complete their education or training
8910843 the program involves providing bungalow style accommodation in the backyards of existing dwellings at youth residential services on private or government land
8910844 what this does is add additional sleeping and study space for young people including those with a disability so they can live more independently while being close to their families
8910845 for example kids under cover has provided a foster care family in queensland with a bungalow so they can take care of a sibling group of four children another bungalow has gone to an organisation housing young people who need support and safety
8910846 kids under covers leadership is an example to others to invest back into their communities and in our young people who are our future
8910847 i congratulate you on your commitment to be financially independent and i encourage others to support your efforts
8910848 it is no secret the growing shortage of housing across all areas of australia is having significant flow on effects to low income and vulnerable people
8910849 the rental market squeeze is making it even more difficult for young people who are homeless to step up to access affordable private rental accommodation
8910850 i commend kids under cover for its initiative and its commitment and i welcome the organisation to queensland

8910852 betty kiernan member for mt isa my ministers and have been working side by side with the newly elected mayor of cloncurry shire andrew daniels and his council to find solutions to cloncurrys current water situation
8910853 we are well aware of the seriousness of the situation and have stated on a number of occasions that we are not going to see this community without water
8910854 this is on top of allocations we have already made of three recent subsidies totaling 3 7 million for water infrastructure projects to address cloncurrys water supply issues this includes 1 879 604 for stage 2 of the cloncurry water supply and treatment upgrade and chinaman creek dam
8910855 my government will work with the council to ascertain the source of water and to assist in activating this action when required the government is very aware of the councils financial situation and their limited capacity to get qualified personnel to assist
8910856 the department of natural recourses and water will work with the council to finalise their demand management plan the government will require this plan be completed by october
8910857 in addressing cloncurrys long term water needs sunwater will prepare a business case for the proposed pipeline from ernest henry mine to cloncurry
8910858 other studies will be completed in respect to proposals such as cleaning out the chinaman creek dam the river well system and river weir will also be undertaken
8910859 the government is very aware of the work that has been undertaken to this point and we are confident that by working with the council and industry we can secure cloncurrys water supply for years to come
8910860 certainly for the particle physicists its the biggest project of everyones career
8910861 but more than every other project the rest of the physics community knows whats going on too theyre aware that something big is happening
8910862 were too concerned with getting the machine up and running to think about that
8910863 and hopefully we can demonstrate its relevance in the uk and worldwide
8910864 the technological spin offs to me theyre an aside a project like this is inspiring and thats what encourages young people thats what encouraged me people go into it because its exciting and cutting edge and you need almost no argument except that the biggest benefit of the moon landings was the new generation of scientists that they inspired
8910865 its a leap into the dark in a way that no particle accelerator has been before were at the limit of our capabilities the closest thing i think weve done is gone to the moon
8910866 the unknown is always very exciting for physicists put it this way well be surprised if there isnt a surprise

8910907 we have only received them in the last few hours and i consider that if these proceedings have to take place there is a proper place for conducting and airing these matters and that is within the tribunal itself

8910969 khullar then went to stay at the hotel and at the end of his stay he told the hotel to bill the travel agent
8910970 when the company said they had not made the booking the hotel immediately alerted all 30 hotels on the new security network system which is now running in edinburghs city centre
8910971 so when khullar tried to use the same scam on the radisson they called us and we told them to let him check in until we had done some checks on him before we then went round and arrested him for fraud
8910972 this is the first example of the system working which is very good news

8910975 there was no need for more talks since there was a deal already on the table that was waiting to be signed
8910976 to our knowledge this is the first report of a direct association between childhood abuse and asthma and asthma related outcomes
8910977 we wanted to explore whether exposure to stress and violence is associated with an increased risk of asthma in urban children living in puerto rico
8910978 we already know that there is a high prevalence of asthma in puerto rican children and many studies have linked stress and exposure to violence to health problems in childhood including asthma
8910979 children with a history of abuse had higher frequencies of all outcomes of interest than those without a history of abuse
8910980 after adjusting for relevant covariates history of abuse was associated with an approximate doubling of the odds of current asthma healthcare use for asthma and allergic rhinitis
8910981 it is not simply the exposure to a particular stressor but the physiological response to that stressor that predicts physical health outcomes
8910982 latino culture places an emphasis on certain values and social supports that may buffer the effects of poverty and community violence experienced by children in puerto rico
8910983 our findings highlight the importance of both screening for illnesses such as asthma in children who are abused and of being aware of the possibility of abuse in children with asthma
8910984 if present at all was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
8910985 while such a reduction in all cause mortality would have been impressive these mortality benefits are likely implausible previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated a healthy user benefit or frailty bias
8910986 over the last two decades in the united sates even while vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality further only about 10 percent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 percent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion
8910987 the healthy user effect is seen in what doctors often refer to as their good patients patients who are well informed about their health who exercise regularly do not smoke or have quit drink only in moderation watch what they eat come in regularly for health maintenance visits and disease screenings take their medications exactly as prescribed and quite religiously get vaccinated each year so as to stay healthy such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
8910988 but you also need to take care of yourself everyone can reduce their risk by taking simple precautions
8910989 wash your hands avoid sick kids and hospitals during flu season consider antiviral agents for prophylaxis and tell your doctor as soon as you feel unwell because there is still a chance to decrease symptoms and prevent hospitalization if you get sick because flu vaccine is not as effective as people have been thinking it is
8910990 the healthy user effect is everywhere you dont want it to be

8911035 its been really great because sometimes when you come into a show everyones already all tight in a performed group and you feel a bit intimidated but absolutely not at all i completely feel part of the team and its just fantastic coming into a group of mates that are already formed but welcome other people in as friends
8911036 fairly near the start after saying farewell to the third sidekick i kind of have a bit of a nosey into the lives of the world saving team and kind of butt my way in
8911037 well it is a lot younger than my age range because im 18 but i have seen it on tv a few times and got a lot more into it as i found about the auditions at first i didnt actually know how popular it was until you watch a bit more and hear a lot more people talking about it and you go onto the website and theres forums and loads of stuff going on around it but yeah i thought it was great because with childrens tv its normally quite patronising but not with this at all theres no moral of the day at the end of every story its just completely the same as doctor who and adults can watch it as well which i thought was great
8911038 the only similarity that she has is that shes a girl really and she lives in the same house and thats about as far as it goes in personality terms i dont think theyre that similar apart from theyre both quite strong willed but i think theres a lot less tears from rani than there were from maria i think her relationship with sarah jane is a lot different as well i think with rani shes very much an apprentice of sarah jane which is a really nice relationship i think but it does take some getting use to because at first youll find that sarah jane is not really that interested in taking on another child
8911039 shes kind of shadowing sarah jane a lot and youll see that if theres a moment where she doesnt quite know how to attack a situation whether to be quiet whether to be scared worried or to be strong shell always watch sarah jane if sarah jane goes in being really bolshy youll see a few seconds later shes up there as well shes just really into her fighting not fighting physically but fighting mentally shes quite strong really strong willed and shes a girl between two guys at times which is nice
8911040 i like the ending because weve got a really nice combination of monsters in that one and its not just one monster either weve got two different monsters who unite and form an evil pair so thats a good one

8911282 youre right about the speculation buyers who have in many cases made a lot of money in this marketplace in the last four or five years you are losing them because you cant hold them for a year and make a huge profit anymore but there is still a human need for those people that want to live here retire here or work here
8911283 winnipeg my mothers side of the family has been out here for quite a while you know my grandmother very well joan panton who started the sunshine theatre with her husband herb williams i came out to live here in my mid teens i started my business side with earls and then followed my grandfather and my father into the financial field i got my securities degree and here i am
8911284 it has turned into a buyers market but there is still growth out there in the marketplace to a balance that see some very fine deals taking place we are looking for an increase in this year our listings are quality and that is what the buyer is after we have set up the boardroom at our office so that a buyer can come in take their time looking at each home they are interested in on our big screen they can see everything and can make a decision there about taking time in their schedule to look at a property that really doesnt interest them
8911285 that wasnt my field i soon found out and because i liked cars so much decided this wasnt a bad profession either there were a bunch of us in salmon arm that liked the automobile business and a local businessman in the city saw what i could do without training and made me an offer that i would come to work for him and he would train me in the business i quickly jumped on the chance to see where it would go and whether i would like this as professional and business i wasnt all that sure i wanted to make the move for my future in this direction but decided to stick it out and it was a good career decision my dad was a heavy duty mechanic so i had that for a background the natural aptitude was there
8911286 i graduated from salmon arm high school and went to work in the shop where my dad worked in the parts department shipping and receiving then i decided to go traveling for a year when i was doing that job in the parts department i was most interested in how the place ran as a business when i came back from my year of travel i decided i was going to take the business program at ouc at that point it didnt matter what business it was going to be i just knew i wanted to get involved in something i had a mentor in salmon arm that helped me to get an inside look at the business world before i was finished school the opportunity to take over the auto body shop where todd worked in kelowna became available we worked out the details of what it would take to buy the shop and six months later we started in september 2003
8911287 we took over rudys body shop and in march 2004 and we renamed the business prestige collision we just didnt have enough room at rudys as you know it was a small operation for things like parking so we started to look the following year we had a couple of deals fall through before we found this space on kirschner road we put our offer in and it was accepted in june 2007
8911288 on part of the project we hired a general contractor because of our lack of expertise in this area even in the family there was no construction experience the contractor built the body shop and we tackled the strip commercial centre
8911289 in our first shop we hired a couple of people that were older than us but they didnt fit into our way of thinking about the future stuck in their ways probably describes it best were stubborn and very precise about the way we want things done with the customer front and centre all the time because we started this new shop we wanted harmony from the get go and hiring the young technicians has been the best thing that we could have done and the work they produce is outstanding it is great to have people on staff that actually care if the customer comes back in the future were trying to create a culture that you will feel when you come into the building where people will see the work that is being done by a crew who will care about the finished product it makes for a good place to work everyone on staff is part of what we are trying to accomplish here the last eight months in the old building were super stressful we were so tight on space and it was difficult for everyone but they saw what our plans were for this new location and they wanted to be a part of the expansion and the future we are four times the size now that we were back then our specialty is collision repair thats what we fix we dont really restore cars or do complete paint jobs our specialty would be making your car look as good or better than before it was in an accident

8911448 it was born out of a desire to help language learners access quality language blogs as there currently is no such list published on the internet
8911449 the wide range of topics is truly amazing from teaching a language or reviewing online education tools to writing a public diary sharing the foreign language learning process
8911450 whereas blogging is considered mainstream in the us by now many language enthusiasts around the world are only recently discovering the possibilities of the web
8911451 we also see that mainly us bloggers embrace additional features tools and plug ins in their blogs
8911452 the responses have been overwhelmingly positive many readers have pointed out excellent language blogs which are not on the list yet
8911453 americans last night got their closest look yet at barack obama the shooting star bidding to be our next president
8911454 those who cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it go to the source and contemplate the fact that obama is another knee jerk reaction on the part of the democrats in the same vein as carter and clinton

8911459 and fight qaatiloo in the way of allah those who fight you
8911460 fight them qaatiloohum till there is no persecution and the religion is allahs
8911461 so fight qaatiloo in the way of allah and know that allah is all hearing all knowing
8911462 those who are believers fight yuqaatiloona in the way of allah and the unbelievers fight in the idols way so fight qaatiloo the friends of satan surely the guile of satan is ever feeble
8911463 fight them qaatiloohum till there is no persecution and the religion is allahs entirely
8911464 but if they break their oaths after their covenant and thrust at your religion then fight qaatiloo the leaders of unbelief
8911465 fight qaatiloo those who believe not in allah and the last day and do not forbid what allah and his messenger have forbidden such men as practise not the religion of truth being of those who have been given the book until they pay the tribute out of hand and have been humbled
8911466 o believers fight qaatiloo the unbelievers kuffaar who are near to you and let them find in you a harshness ghilza
8911467 but fight them not by the holy mosque until they should fight you there then if they fight you slay them aqtuloohum such is the recompense of unbelievers
8911468 then if they turn their backs take them and slay them aqtuloohum wherever you find them
8911469 if they withdraw not from you and offer you peace and restrain their hands take them and slay them aqtuloohum wherever you come on them against them we have given you a clear authority
8911470 then when the sacred months are drawn away slay aqtuloo the idolaters wherever you find them and take them and confine them and lie in wait for them at every place of ambush
8911471 so let them fight yuqaatil in the way of allah who sell the present life for the world to come and whosoever fights yuqaatil in the way of allah and is slain or conquers we shall bring him a mighty wage
8911472 when you meet the unbelievers smite darba their necks then when you have made wide slaughter among them tie fast the bonds then set them free either by grace or ransom till the war lays down its loads

8911477 normalmente se compran los dos primeros n meros como mucho y luego la gente se cansa de gastarse dinero ya que los fasc culos cada vez son m s caros y todo son trastos
8911478 si fueran colecciones m s cortas de cinco o diez n meros la gente las terminar a pero es que a lo mejor te encuentras con colecciones de 60 100 libros
8911479 si valen a 9 99 y son cien libros imag nate lo que sube la colecci n
8911480 lo que m s se venden son los libros que se venden bastante pero lo que son maquetas y cosas as que se hacen muy largas no

8911489 but judging by for example the number of users who downloaded our patches there were a lot more active players than there were unit sales
8911490 and i think we can safely say if they were still playing the game by the time our latest patch released and if they were playing on a pirated copy then they were a sale that didnt happen but probably would have had it not been possible to obtain the game illegally
8911491 the consoles themselves are in one sense simply very good drm technologies that consumers welcome and pay for in order to receive the benefits that come with them such as the healthy variety of games which are able to prosper in such a protected environment and the greater ease of installation use and reliability

8911493 these microdomains are so tiny you could fit five million on them on a full stop there are 10 000 receptors on each cell and we are able to follow how single drug molecules bind to individual receptors in these specialised microdomains
8911494 what makes this single molecule laser technique unique is that we are looking at them in real time on a living cell other techniques that investigate how drugs bind to their receptors require many millions of cells to get a big enough signal and this normally involves destroying the cells in the process
8911495 we strongly recommend restrictions in the use of thiazolidinediones the class of drugs and question the rationale for leaving rosiglitazone on the market
8911496 at this time justification for use of thiazolidinediones is very weak to non existent
8911497 further compound their already increased risk of developing ischemic heart disease
8911498 represent conditions that are major precursors of congestive heart failure
8911499 we reported in the journal diabetes care in june 2007 that thiazolidinediones doubled the risk of congestive heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes
8911500 the increased heart failure appears to be a class effect
8911501 the unfavorable findings from the three trials have not been fully realized by the medical community
8911502 safer cheaper and more effective treatment alternatives are available that do not carry these negative cardiovascular risks in patients with diabetes
8911503 whether its protecting gorillas in the republic of congo or monkeys and gibbons in cambodia conservation can and does work when you have government commitment and scientific knowledge on the ground
8911504 now we must put into place the management to truly protect these populations and apply the approach to other regions where primates are in trouble
8911505 despite this good news in cambodia the area still remains at risk from conversion to agro industrial plantations for crops including biofuels and commercial mining
8911506 wcs is therefore committed to continuing to work with the cambodian government to ensure that these globally important primate populations will continue to remain secure
8911507 scientists have identified a mutant form of a gene or allele that prohibits the growth of armour
8911508 by documenting the physical traits and genetic makeup of the offspring produced by these marine sticklebacks in freshwater we were able to track how natural selection operates on this gene
8911509 we found a significant increase in the frequency of this allele in their offspring evidence that natural selection favours reduced armour in freshwater
8911510 it leads us to believe that the genetic expression is also tied to increased growth rate
8911511 if the fish arent expending resources growing bones which may be significantly more difficult in freshwater due to its lack of ions they can devote more energy to increasing biomass
8911512 this in turn allows them to breed earlier and improves over winter survival rate
8911513 this study provides further evidence for darwins theory of natural selection by showing that environmental conditions can directly impact genes controlling physical traits that affect the survival of species
8911514 once developed this molecule will cause much less wheezing and shortness of breath and should be able to be given safely to the hundreds of thousands of patients with both heart and lung diseases furthermore because it will have so few side effects it has the potential to become the beta blocker of choice for all heart patients
8911515 we know that beta blockers save lives in patients with heart disease so making them safe for those unlucky enough to have a respiratory disorder as well is a clinical imperative
8911516 it is vitally important that we better understand the mechanisms of disease transmission during blood transfusions so we can develop the most effective control measures and minimize human to human infections
8911517 the study shows that for sheep infected with bse or scrapie transmission rates via blood transfusion can be high particularly when donors are in the later stages of infection this suggests that blood transfusion represents an efficient route of transmission for these diseases
8911518 since the results are consistent with what we know about human transmission the work helps justify the control measures put in place to safeguard human blood supplies
8911519 the c f bond is difficult to transform into other bonds under mild conditions because it is inert and unreactive its a challenge to chemists
8911520 but we found a way to take a c f bond that you can do very little with and break it and convert it cleanly into something else at room temperature
8911521 conversion of pfcs remains a challenge and our research efforts are directed at designing even more active catalysts capable of pfc activation
8911522 the c f bond is difficult to transform into other bonds under mild conditions because it is inert and unreactive its a challenge to chemists

8911541 while we welcome news today from the u s census bureau that the number of uninsured americans has declined the picture is not all rosy yes the number of people without health insurance has decreased from 47 million in 2006 to 45 7 million in 2007 but its the government public health programs that are picking up the slack new census data show that enrollment in the medicaid and medicare programs increased by more than 2 million while employer based coverage stayed the same thanks to these public health programs tens of millions of americans can access the care they would otherwise be denied and now given the economic downturn we especially urge congress to protect the medicaid and medicare programs and we call for increasing medicaid funding to the states to protect vulnerable americans which has also been shown to provide an economic stimulus
8911542 this community is made up of 54 million americans and can significantly impact the popular vote and still most members of our community feel that they receive little attention from the presidential candidates and from the political system as a whole

8911544 the windfall to skilled nursing facilities comes with no strings attached there is no reason to believe this windfall will help improve the quality of care or quality of life for nursing home residents
8911545 the center for medicare advocacy calls on cms to recalibrate skilled nursing facilities rates as it proposed in may and to take steps to ensure that skilled nursing facilities use their medicare dollars as congress and cms intended for the care of skilled nursing facilities residents
8911546 cms bases skilled nursing facilities rates in part on costs for nurse staffing the highest daily rate for an urban skilled nursing facility 622 93 includes 288 31 for nursing cms must ensure that skilled nursing facilities actually spend their staffing dollars on staff
8911547 cms admits it has over paid skilled nursing facilities since january 2006 and that the overpayment for fy2009 will be 780 million but it has backed down on its proposal made just last may to recalibrate medicare rates prospectively
8911548 this project is an example of how re2 is applying its advanced intelligent and innovative robotic manipulator technologies to a new field of use to help reduce the number and frequency of physical injuries to nurses and other health care professionals
8911549 the rna program is an exciting venture for re2 and an opportunity to develop innovative technical solutions to real world issues in the health care industry
8911550 the rna project enables re2 to diversify into markets outside of the department of defense
8911551 although several groups have documented that repeated cocaine exposure increases nac spine density the precise molecular mechanisms that control this process have remained elusive
8911552 moreover the cocaine induced increase in nac spine density has been hypothesized to contribute to the long lasting behavioral sensitization that occurs after repeated cocaine exposure but direct evidence concerning the functional relationship between these two processes is lacking
8911553 taken together our findings implicate mef2 as a key regulator of structural synapse plasticity and sensitized responses to cocaine and suggest that reducing mef2 activity and thereby increasing spine density in the nac may be a compensatory mechanism to limit long lasting maladaptive behavioral responses to cocaine
8911554 a better understanding of the mef2 associated molecular mechanisms that regulate cocaine induced structural and behavioral plasticity could ultimately lead to the development of improved treatments for drug addiction
8911555 about one person in every 500 has fh in the uk in fact its one of the most frequently occurring inherited conditions this means that more than 110 000 people in britain have the condition however many people with fh go undetected with often tragic consequences the next step for us will be to ensure this guidance is implemented on the ground
8911556 too often patients are put on generic simvastatin when first diagnosed with fh only to have to keep going for repeat blood tests and consultations until they are eventually moved onto a more effective higher intensity statin which in reality means either rosuvastatin or atorvastatin this guidance has recognised that some adults with fh need to be put onto a high intensity statin immediately particularly if their ldl c levels need to be reduced by more than half

8911559 no matter how much feel good rhetoric is evoked on the eve of obamas speech there isnt a seamless connection between dr kings speech and senator obamas ascendance as the standard bearer for his party
8911560 i was grateful to senator john kennedy for the genuine concern he expressed about my arrest in october 1960 because of my participation in nonviolent efforts to integrate lunch counters in atlanta georgia
8911561 i had to conclude that the then known facts about kennedy were not adequate to make an unqualified judgment in his favor i do feel that as any man he grew a great deal after he became president i thought we really saw two kennedys a kennedy the first two years and another kennedy emerging in 1963 he was getting ready to throw off political considerations and see the real moral issues had president kennedy lived i would probably have endorsed him in 1964 but back at that time i concluded that there was something to be desired in both candidates

8911570 the safety and accuracy of the stereotaxis system has been well documented in electrophysiology procedures as have its ergonomic advantages and reduction of fluoro exposure
8911571 with a growing diabetic population and increased prevalence of pad i am eager to use the magnetic rf guidewire this will be the first cto crossing device that can enable true intra lesion steering and i expect it to substantially improve the range of options for cto treatment
8911572 traditional manual guidewires used for cto crossing have little or no steering ability and therefore can only be used with great difficulty in tortuous vasculature requiring a high level of operator skill and carrying a risk of vessel perforation
8911573 just as the safety accuracy and efficacy of our niobe magnetic navigation system have contributed significantly to the treatment of patients with cardiac arrhythmias in the field of electrophysiology we believe that our powerassert rf guidewire will improve the prospects for treating patients with peripheral arterial disease powerassert opens a significant new market opportunity for stereotaxis underscoring the niobe systems capabilities as a platform for a broad and growing array of interventional procedures
8911574 this is a promising new lead in the search for biological pathways that contribute to obesity
8911575 this finding may eventually lead to the development of new drugs to regulate appetite in people who have not had success with other treatments
8911576 these findings are important as the data suggest treatment with angiomax provides similar protection against ischemia and death over standard therapy at 1 year furthermore at 30 days we saw angiomax reduced major bleeding multiple studies have shown a significant association between bleeding complications in acs and pci with mortality
8911577 the data from the acuity sub analysis suggest treatment with angiomax is an attractive antithrombotic therapeutic option for patients undergoing pci
8911578 these data at 1 year show that angiomax continues to demonstrate safety and efficacy for a full year following a patients angioplasty this is just the latest analysis from seven major randomized trials in nearly 25 000 patients consistently demonstrating angiomax offers improved outcomes for angioplasty patients compared to standard therapy
8911579 additionally angiomax may help reduce hospital costs particularly because of the reductions we have observed in major bleeding complications with approximately one million pci procedures performed in the u s per year incremental cost savings may result in substantial overall savings to the health care system

8911668 brains for hire or what the bank accounts of intellectuals tell us
8911669 intellectuals far from being highly individualistic and nonconformist people follow certain regular patterns of behaviour taken as a group they are often ultraconformist within the circles formed by those whose approval they seek and value that is what makes them en masse so dangerous for it enables them to create climates of opinion and prevailing orthodoxies which themselves often generate irrational and destructive courses of action
8911670 the belief seems to be spreading that intellectuals are no wiser as mentors or worthier as exemplars than the witch doctors and priests of old

8911699 here in america and especially here tonight we need to remember two basic truths
8911700 society has an obligation and christians have a gospel duty to provide adequate and compassionate support for unwed and abandoned mothers women facing unintended pregnancies and women struggling with the aftermath of an abortion
8911701 heres the second truth killing an unborn child is never the right answer to a womans or societys problems acts of violence create a culture of violence and abortion is the most intimate form of violence there is it wounds the woman it kills the unborn child and it poisons the roots of justice and charity that bind us all into one human family
8911702 planned parenthood is the largest single provider of abortion and family suppression services in the united states
8911703 this facility in this minority neighborhood should offend every african american and latino family and all of us because every child lost to abortion here subtracts one more life one more universe of possibilities and talent from the future of this community the business of planned parenthood is the prevention of the future and business is good and very profitable at the expense of this community

8911727 im expecting to see us play faster and more aggressively weve added some blitz type stuff
8911728 ive always no huddled said mcneill who has been a defensive coordinator before at nevada las vegas and appalachian state
8911729 its not anything new we didnt have time to work on it last year i didnt want to do it in the spring because we were teaching but one thing ive always done is no huddle just signal in let everybody see it get lined up and take it from there
8911730 it can be any one of the standup positions from safety or corner or a linebacker he said
8911731 my upbringing and my training in the coaching profession has been make sure your fundamentals and your technique are sound he said
8911732 make sure everybody does the ordinary things and the routine things sound in a tight situation if your team or your group does those things with great efficiency you have a better chance of being successful on that play
8911733 we have been and continue to be in discussions with cbs
8911734 weve been in conversations with them and let them know that its a violation of our bylaws we dont know whats going to happen
8911735 that case was very narrowly applied to major league baseball and that fantasy vendor
8911736 it remains to be seen whether that extends to not only other professional sports but also intercollegiate athletics
8911737 i really dont have an opinion on it although things that kind of draw people in and make them excited about sports and just allow them some dimension of participation i thinks positive
8911738 if a bunch of fans hanging out have fun doing it i dont see any harm in it it seems to me like its a pretty good idea
8911739 its just more promotion for them a way to get their name out a way for people to see other great players that may not be at schools that get as much attention
8911740 i think its good for college football as a whole and good for players
8911741 if it says texas tech wide receiver no 5 or qb no 6 you know who that is you might as well put a name to it

8911744 when patients go to the emergency room the doctors really cant help a lot the cocaine is still in their system
8911745 over 80 000 women served in our armed forces during that war
8911746 although they may not have realized it at the time these early women volunteers did much to break down the barriers for all those service women who have come after them and who continue to serve their country today so proficiently and professionally
8911747 i cant say anything about the coming year either because i dont know what is going to happen we dont even know if we are going to be here we hope that he comes touch wood but in a years time many things can happen cristiano ronaldo here but i am convinced that in the same manner that manchester would love to see all our players in their team cristiano is not going to come now as for the coming year only god knows
8911748 the coach and the sports director want the player to stay and i am sure he will our squad is complete it is impossible for us to have one better than the one we have
8911749 robinho has two years left on his contract therefore he is our player for the next two seasons so you can draw your own conclusions from that
8911750 made worse because of poor services and the practice of first cousin marriages in arab communities
8911751 it wasnt way off from referee to referee across the country cameron said
8911752 i like the fact that it has the potential to add plays to a game leach said
8911753 the reason they have it is in hopes of shortening the game i think thats a far better way than trying to reduce plays
8911754 its a sad indictment of our broken society that so many are turning to drug and alcohol abuse at such a young age
8911755 and these figures only highlight the worst cases those that end up in hospital
8911756 we found 38 per cent of mature men and 29 per cent of mature women were having sex more than once a week
8911757 thats a significant amount of older men and women having a lot of sex perhaps more than many of us suspected
8911758 these people are not frothy young singles out at the clubs having hot casual sex
8911759 theyre more likely to be at home with their loved one in front of the fire so in that respect its quite impressive
8911760 in the future we can look at these and other factors in women who quit smoking during pregnancy to assess who is at low or high risk of relapse we can then offer more intensive interventions for those at higher risk to address the physical behavioral and social issues related to relapse
8911761 many of the women who relapsed were already trying to quit again when we interviewed them while there is no simple solution we recommend directly addressing the social and financial stresses that lead to relapse we hope that our study will encourage creative interventions to help mothers sustain a smoke free lifestyle after pregnancy improving overall health for women and their families
8911762 i dont think hell be able to get back on the field for at least six or seven weeks
8911763 i am very grateful for this opportunity and i understand my responsibilities to the dallas cowboys and the national football league right now i just want to keep working hard so i can accomplish the goals that i have set for myself both on and off the field
8911764 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
8911765 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process

8911848 but were very pleasantly surprised to discover it as a beacon for finding the earliest blood stem cells known as well as new ways to find and manipulate this marker to make them grow

8911878 animal studies have indicated for years that msg might be associated with weight gain
8911879 ours is the first study to show a link between msg use and weight in humans
8911880 second human studies where msg was added to the diet have failed to show changes in body weight and third a recently published rat study suggests that msg in the diet actually suppresses body weight
8911881 we found that prevalence of overweight was significantly higher in msg users than in non users
8911882 we saw this risk even when we controlled for physical activity total calorie intake and other possible explanations for the difference in body mass the positive associations between msg intake and overweight were consistent with data from animal studies
8911883 in the he et al study the average bmi among non msg users versus the highest quartile of estimated msg use was 22 3 versus 23 5 given this small difference the imprecise methods by which msg intake was estimated and controlled human studies that directly conflict with the results of this report the glutamate association statement strongly questions the broad extrapolation made by the authors
8911884 numerous regulatory authorities and expert bodies including fao who fda health canada efsa and fsanz all have concluded that msg is safe for use as an ingredient in foods

8911889 there are more than 35 million people who still use terrestrial over the air signals to receive tv signals theyre the ones who will be affected by the transition
8911890 but im not sure the government anticipated all the issues involved in such a massive undertaking
8911891 this transition has not been as smooth as trade associations and government officials claim
8911892 people are still confused of which box to buy and whether or not theyll have the right equipment for next february and some network and local over the air broadcasters are jumping the gun and cutting off analog broadcasts early so folks in those areas without cable boxes or satellite have already lost some of their tv signals
8911893 we are at the mercy of the manufacturers so sometimes well have a few older and newer boxes sitting right next to each other and it is hard to tell the consumer what to pick

8912021 facing severe price competition the group has leveraged its strong brand equity and design capability and placed an emphasis on boosting profitability rather than driving sheer volume growth to this end the group has embarked on a differentiation strategy to distinguish its products from rivals with the offering of an optimized product mix with unique design
8912022 to complement its existing product portfolio the group has established a separate business and product development teams for non down apparel products a product preview was presented in march 2008 in beijing which garnered positive feedback the new product series will be launched in the second half of this fiscal year enabling the group to leverage its strong brand equity to ease the seasonality issue of the down apparel business establishment of designated retail point of sales for this new product line is also underway
8912023 meanwhile leveraging its wealth of experience in the down apparel sector and in depth market understanding as well as an extensive retail network in the chinese market the group will continue to identify appropriate opportunities for mergers and acquisitions of premium and renowned apparel brands that offer good development potential for brand expansion and a broadened product portfolio we believe that the business of the group will further develop and maximize the return to our shareholders

8912032 its so beautifully arranged on the plate you know someones fingers have been all over it
8912033 in cooking youve got to have a what the hell attitude
8912034 this is probably the most provocative hypothesis i have ever and will ever advance
8912035 cloud and radiation budget changes associated with tropical intraseasonal oscillations
8912036 the side employing a relatively higher personal focus in their attacks on the other sides ideas
8912037 apparently our addition of nine molecules of carbon dioxide to each 100 000 molecules of air over the last 150 years can now be blamed for anything and everything we choose
8912038 the warming that allowed the vikings to farm in greenland 1 000 years ago was surely natural but we are now told that warming in greenland today is surely manmade glaciers retreating in western canada have revealed evidence of previous forests showing that warming and cooling cycles do indeed occur even without suvs yet the suv is now the scapegoat for retreating glaciers
8912039 but mccain has made it clear that the science really does not matter anyway because even if humans are not to blame for global warming stopping carbon dioxide emissions is the right thing to do and if we had another choice for most of our energy needs i might be willing to accept such a claim as harmless enough
8912040 but carbon dioxide is necessary for life on earth and i have a difficult time calling something so fundamentally important a
8912041 so here we are with bad science ready to support bad policy decisions that will lead to bad economic times ahead and no presidential candidate who is willing to ask the hard questions
8912042 no we cant measure the heat content of the entire earth
8912043 is this something that should lead us to doubt model predictions of global warming
8912044 this is not an exacting recipe its hash or hamburger helper not souffl
8912045 what value does roy use for the mixed layer depth one kilometer to be sure on the centennial scale some heat does get buried several hundred meters deep in the ocean at least in some limited parts of the ocean however to assume that all radiative imbalances are instantaneously mixed away to a depth of 1000 meters is oceanographically ludicrous
8912046 give me 4 parameters and i will fit an elephant five and i will make him wiggle his trunk
8912047 the satellite data set confirms that the climate is warming
8912048 global warming stopped in 1998 meme is nonsense just go check our earlier posts on the subject raypierre
8912049 i predict that there will be an increasing number of scientific publications in the coming years describing newly found stabilizing processes in the climate system
8912050 who would use climate change to bring about a dictatorship of the proletariat
8912051 or you will become like those fastidious people who polish and polish until there is nothing left
8912052 given 8 free parameters we could fit the new york skyline
8912053 clouds are a different matter while theres no credible evidence for a significant stabilizing cloud feedback one cant easily rule that out on basic physical grounds
8912054 now if you meant the other red curve in the graph below that is not from data at all that is what you would get from roys combination of the pdo and so indices using his scaling factor if you dont hide the amplitude by taking a five year running mean
8912055 and besides the soi pdo example took me 1 hour on a weekend with a very simple single idea internet access and an excel spreadsheet
8912056 in fact both forster and held had to construct their own simple models of the effect to understand what i was talking about so that they could convince themselves now i am not a modeler im more of an observationalist why did it take someone like me to point this out before anyone else in the modeling community discovered it im not funded to do this stuff they are
8912057 the ipcc among others nailed that and nobody has demonstrated that natural variability can do the trick
8912058 since your whole website is directed at true believers and generally non technical people how about a straightforward and easy to understand article that unambiguously proves the above sentence that you repeat like a mantra yet never seem to provide comprehensible evidence for
8912059 while i find some of the denier arguments dumb or disingenuous at best what you dish up on this web site is hardly reassuring either
8912060 the ipcc among others nailed that and nobody has demonstrated that natural variability can do the trick
8912061 during the past 20 years atmospheric temperatures have actually tended to go down
8912062 as shown in the second chart based on very reliable satellite data which have been confirmed by measurements from weather balloons
8912063 the average lifetime of a molecule of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere before it is captured by vegetation and afterward released is about twelve years
8912064 it means the ice shelf is disintegrating the pieces are pinned together like a jigsaw but could float away
8912065 were seeing very dramatic changes from the retreat of the glaciers to the melting of the sea ice
8912066 we had 23 less sea ice last year than weve ever had and whats happening to the ice shelves is part of that picture
8912067 nobody has demonstrated that natural variability can do the trick
8912068 when you prove to me that man is causing climate change then i will give a s t about science
8912069 that now mixed in with hedge fund market manipulation and biofuel development to answer that other little problem of increasing oil prices
8912070 even lindzen has abandoned his earlier claims that water vapor would prove a stabilizing feedback
8912071 to the extent that the cloud changes actually cause temperature change this can ultimately lead to overestimates of how sensitive earths climate is to our greenhouse gas emissions
8912072 since it is the best means of competing with the body of fact that exists in the minds of the general public it is also the means of establishing a controversy
8912073 is waste heat produced by human activities important for the climate no in any given period of time the sun provides almost 10000 times as much energy to
8912074 in this essay however i will argue that humanity faces a much greater danger from the glaciation associated with the next ice age
8912075 will solar cycle 25 mentioned earlier and predicted by nasa to be comparable to the dalton minimum be the trigger for a new ice age
8912076 are we fully appreciating the point that clouds are merely a byproduct of heat being transported from the surface to upper levels the more clouds there are the more heat that has been transferred from the surface to be dissipated into the upper levels and eventually into space is it not
8912077 so heres what roy did he took two indices of interannual variability the southern oscillation soi index which is a proxy for el nino and the pacific decadal oscillation index pdoi he formed an ad hoc weighted sum of these indices

8912095 das ist kein gegner den man untersch tzen darf denn sie haben roter stern belgrad ausgeschaltet von daher kann man nicht sagen dass das ein kleiner gegner ist ich kann mich erinnern dass ajax amsterdam mal dort gespielt und sich sehr schwer getan hat
8912096 das ist ganz bestimmt ein schwieriges los aber trotzdem machbar wir haben eine reelle chance in die gruppenphase einzuziehen

8912120 i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america

8912149 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue abortion that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition

8912151 there are three ways humor and laughter help us when life gets bumpy
8912152 the first is that humor gives us perspective and changes the way we see the world
8912153 serious illness is not funny death and dying are not funny but funny things happen in those situations
8912154 i do at my age my back goes out more than i do
8912155 humor is all around you just have to look for it
8912156 it wasnt easy i made gratitude lists read norman cousins fell totally and unexpectedly in love with a good friend hes got a wicked sense of humor and so do i ive never laughed so hard in my life
8912157 when youre told you have a year to live and that youll die an extremely painful death you have two choices you can either prepare to die or you can say oh hell might as well have the best time i can with what i have left for me laughter tipped the balance
8912158 i truly believe a positive attitude helped save my life
8912159 you must give up the constant fussing about things you can do nothing about so you learn to see the small funny things about them
8912160 give yourself a shot in the arm with whatever tickles your funny bone
8912161 humor and laughter arent substitutes for medical care but they can be adjuncts humor can be a tremendous liberating source for coping in tough times
8912162 mom you know according to statistics im supposed to be dead in a month
8912163 well i guess you better hold your breath if youre going to make that deadline
8912164 i think maybe black humor is a form of bravado and also a release for the buildup of painful emotions
8912165 we flirt with controversy because the terrorists are muslim extremists but its ok since our hero is a good muslim

8912171 in the first two episodes just dont blink or youll miss a lot there is more action than youve ever seen at once before
8912172 my diet has a lot to do with my getting into shape i have no sugar i dont eat fruit or even fruit juice because of the sugar i eat chicken and salmon and rice i eat avocados ill have egg whites for breakfast and sometimes turkey burgers for lunch i try to do just 1 200 calories a day it may sound like its not much but its actually a lot of food if you eat the right things

8912199 prior studies have indicated reduced bone density in hiv infected patients but little was known whether fracture risk increased in this population
8912200 these data are the first to suggest that there is a clinically significant increase in bone fractures among hiv infected patients using data from a large healthcare system
8912201 hiv patients with risk for low bone density should be assessed and potentially treated to prevent fractures

8912236 spa is a fantastic race track with unique corners and a very special character although these days with the v8 engines it is no problem taking the eau rouge combination in the hollow at full throttle it remains a standout feature compression is absolutely no problem physically but its nevertheless a very special sensation for the spectators too i can well recommend this section its very impressive the way the cars come roaring along downhill and then accelerate uphill again in the current race calendar spa is the nearest gp circuit to my home town of m nchengladbach and thats another reason for me to look forward to the belgian grand prix where ill be aiming to achieve a good result
8912237 from my point of view the race in spa is one of the best grands prix in the calendar it is a very unique track with high speed corners you can approach with different racing lines the most famous corners in spa francorchamps are definitely eau rouge and the bus stop chicane which was modified before last years race the circuit is very long and very tricky you have to find the right balance and the right configuration of the car in order not to lose any lap time another crucial factor is the weather in belgium it can rain in one sector and it can be dry in another sector i am really looking forward to the race
8912238 spa francorchamps is one of the specialities in the formula one calendar
8912239 spa may not be the track with the highest speeds that accolade belongs to monza but in spa we have the longest stretch taken at full throttle
8912240 nicks f1 08 is scheduled to take on a new bmw p86 8 engine with a new transmission while robert will be driving with the same engine and gear box as in valencia in the first two thirds of the season we didnt have a single retirement caused by any technical fault we aim to maintain this high level of reliability on the sporting side we plan to improve further and see both cars finish solidly in the points at spa
8912241 spa is one of the last natural circuits remaining in the calendar and therefore ranks among the classics
8912242 a crucial factor will be how to exploit the tyre potential in spa we use the two hardest compounds which is a challenge particularly if air temperatures are low the weather in spa is always a big unknown as it can turn from one moment to the next sometimes even within individual sections of the track
8912243 a coup would not solve anything it will hurt the countrys image and worsen the countrys situation
8912244 we are trying to deal with the protesters as gently as possible

8912253 we are taking our children and leaving and we dont even know where we are going
8912254 my hungry children are crying and we are eating raw rice without boiling it
8912255 i know how villagers are somehow managing to keep themselves alive by eating whatever food is available to them
8912256 it is not easy to distribute food to over two million displaced villagers i know their condition
8912257 the camps are not organised yet and we are receiving reports of diseases
8912258 ich glaube wir liegen mit dem album richtig einige songs haben g nsehautfeeling das ist f r mich ein gutes barometer
8912259 es gibt neue begegnungen neue eindr cke neue erlebnisse neue inhalte die ich verarbeiten wollte aber in den vergangenen jahren nicht verarbeitet habe es gibt ein alter das eine rolle spielt einen sohn der eine rolle spielt genau das versuche ich zu reflektieren
8912260 carl ist mister rock n roll er hat ein sehr breites spektrum und was er spielt klingt dabei sehr handgemacht du h rst ihn wenn er spielt und du merkst wenn er nicht da ist wir hatten w hrend er weg war weiterhin erfolg aber wenn er jetzt wieder dabei ist merkt man was gefehlt hat
8912261 er hat uns gut getan und einfach wirklich entscheidende neue soundideen eingebracht
8912262 mit einer positiven einstellung kann man vieles bewegen im leben die erkenntnis und der entschluss das so zu sehen ist oft ein guter motor nat rlich bekommt man auf die schnauze nat rlich gibt es hindernisse aber wenn man so reingeht im leben dann kann man viel ausrichten
8912263 wenn mich jemand fragt was willst du jetzt mit diesem album dann sage ich ihm wir k nnen nicht nur anderen einen dienst erweisen sondern auch uns selbst die ganze analyse der lieder basiert auf dem blick nach innen und wenn ich in mich hineinblicke dann ist es nicht nur f r andere so sondern auch weil es mir selbst hilft
8912264 eines der sch nsten liebeslieder die ich je gesungen habe
8912265 das lied beginnt wie ein liebeslied und man hat das gef hl jetzt kommt die ber frau sofort um die ecke und dann ist es doch
8912266 du machst solche lieder auch weil du die vision hast in solchen kleine konzerthallen zu spielen
8912267 h ren und sehen sollen intensiver erlebt werden auf solchen b hnen ist es auf ganz andere art und weise m glich den rahmen zu durchsprengen und eine intime atmosph re herzustellen und es gibt trotzdem rock n roll
8912268 wir sind am nachmittag der abend steht noch vor uns

8912270 we were all fathers on that team thats why we stayed and went back
8912271 this was actually supposed to be a 10 day job
8912272 this was a guarded resort and my original surveillance reconnaissance led us to a window of opportunity on a tuesday the 19th
8912273 youre bringing a mother across the world and within 100 metres of her children
8912274 shes on the balcony and she hasnt seen them for six months
8912275 when i woke up in the morning i just didnt feel right i couldnt walk away
8912276 so i put it to the team and we were keen on staying back and just helping her in her situation
8912277 we were only found out in the last 15 minutes
8912278 we were handing our boarding passes over and we noticed an increased presence more uniforms coming around the corner just as we were getting on the plane
8912279 you have guys that will be executed for their crimes in there mixing with people for just having the wrong visa
8912280 very crowded very harsh and the food was really terrible
8912281 ill always be involved in that because theres always little jobs popping up here and there
8912282 we were armed in iraq but we do everything we can not to fight
8912283 we try to operate underneath the noses of the bad guys and not take them on
8912284 were using models what we worked with in the military in high risk high stress environments
8912285 die strom und gasbezugskosten haben sich in den vergangenen zw lf monaten stark verteuert
8912286 diese kosten mussten wir an die kunden weitergeben die zeitverz gerung mit der das in der regel geschieht hat unser ergebnis belastet
8912287 der verlauf des ersten halbjahrs hat die erwartungen die wir angesichts der schwierigen rahmenbedingungen auf den energiem rkten f r das gesamtjahr haben best tigt
8912288 officers have completed a search of the outbuildings and are now in the process of removing vehicles from the site
8912289 we have completed a cursory search of the annexe part of the main building which is relatively intact following the fire
8912290 we will enter the main part of the house today and forensic specialists will begin the lengthy painstaking process of sifting and examining all the contents
8912291 die neuen zahlen zeigen nicht nur dass die zahl der v ter in elternzeit weiter w chst die m nner entdecken auch dass das neue elterngeld eine gro e chance f r sie bedeutet beruf und familie ganz flexibel und passend zur pers nlichen lebenssituation miteinander zu vereinbaren
8912292 auch wenn sich im ersten jahr nach dem start die mehrheit der v ter noch f r eine kurze auszeit von zwei monaten entschieden hat wollen sich in sieben bundesl ndern schon mehr als 15 prozent aller antragsteller ein ganzes jahr zeit f r ihr neugeborenes nehmen
8912293 egal ob zwei oder zw lf monate ich freue mich ber jeden aktiven vater und bin berzeugt dass ihr beispiel weiter schule macht

8912299 ein wesentliches charakteristikum des erblichen brustkrebses ist zudem dass er deutlich fr her entsteht als die sporadische form die frauen sind h ufig schon im alter von 30 bis 40 jahren betroffen
8912300 in zw lf spezialisierten zentren in deutschland werden frauen umfassend und multidisziplin r beraten um ihnen eine informierte und selbst ndige entscheidung f r eine genetische testung zu erlauben
8912301 den kontakt mit anderen betroffenen herzustellen ist jedoch bei der vergleichsweise geringen zahl der erblich bedingt erkrankenden nicht einfach
8912302 die diagnose krebs ist nach wie vor eine potentiell t dliche erkrankung daher muss die optimale versorgung der krebskranken menschen im vordergrund stehen
8912303 mit der tagung wollen wir die kompetenz unserer mitglieder st rken und eine qualifizierte grundlage f r ihre arbeit in den selbsthilfegruppen schaffen

8912309 i want to act as a leader and make sure that the team achieve its goals the pressure does not at all frighten me and i know that expectations are very high
8912310 we have accomplished a lot last year and worked so hard to get there we now know what we are capable and we believe we can beat all teams

8912317 ti va una bella battuta di caccia emmett ne sar entusiasta
8912318 edward ciao le mie orecchie funzionano ancora come una volta hai per caso detto vbattuta di caccia tu non sai quanto io ti voglia bene in questo momento

8912329 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision i think well all hear from him shortly and hopefully well be able to move forward together
8912330 the collision points are where the game is going to be won or lost
8912331 there are still a few grey areas in the interpretation of the laws at the breakdowns so it is important that we adapt to the way the referee manages it
8912332 we lost against the sharks a few weeks ago because we didnt round off our chances and they were better than us at the breakdowns
8912333 with wikus and deon playing good rugby at the moment we have to be at the top of our game on the ground
8912334 if they win this game they can still earn a semifinal place
8912335 but if they lose it will complicate matters for them terribly for us it is one of the few home games we have left so this is a very important game for both teams
8912336 the bulls have a lot of experience and they have made a good shift in their game plan
8912337 they have a good kicking game and they can run the ball with all the firepower out wide which is very different to the one dimensional rugby they played in the past so we are expecting a really tough game
8912338 przegra a gruzja kt rej armia i infrastruktura zosta y w znacznej mierze zniszczone a przywr cenie terytorialnej integralno ci wydaje si zdecydowanie bardziej odleg e ni miesi c temu przegra zach d bo udowodni e w obronie swoich sojusznik w na wschodzie zdolny jest jedynie do dyplomatycznych protest w i wyraz w oburzenia najbardziej przegra a rosja bo w jej pokojowe intencje i demokratyzacj wierzy ju mo e tylko sko czony debil a to oznacza wymierne straty gospodarcze i polityczne widoczne ju teraz
8912339 talk to the shepherd do you want to go to hell
8912340 one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened
8912341 the padres are excited about our continued agreement with the portland beavers
8912342 with merritt paulson and his staff we know we have a great partner in the portland franchise the player and staff experience in portland is a vital part of the growth process to the major leagues and is a perfect fit for the padres organization
8912343 we look forward to continuing our association with merritt paulson and the entire portland beavers organization for the next two years
8912344 as the final stepping stone before they enter into the major leagues several of our players have reaped the benefits of the great facility and staff in portland
8912345 i cant say anything about the coming year either because i dont know what is going to happen we dont even know if we are going to be here we hope that he comes touch wood but in a years time many things can happen cristiano ronaldo here but i am convinced that in the same manner that manchester would love to see all our players in their team cristiano is not going to come now as for the coming year only god knows
8912346 the coach and the sports director want the player to stay and i am sure he will our squad is complete it is impossible for us to have one better than the one we have
8912347 robinho has two years left on his contract therefore he is our player for the next two seasons so you can draw your own conclusions from that

8912351 in todays difficult economic environment our local construction members will be at a loss as to why the employer is taking this stance
8912352 staythorpe is in a very good catchment area for construction workers and the fact that the employer is not utilising this labour pool in the first instance is incredulous as it would most definitely be cheaper for the company to use local labour
8912353 if there was a shortage in local labour then the decisions being undertaken could be understandable but this is clearly not the case and the company have failed to even consider this fact
8912354 we see new media as harbouring great growth potential for our business
8912355 this will enable us to optimally exploit the potential offered by our movie library
8912356 we will increasingly be positioning ourselves as a digital marketplace for erotica
8912357 and will also be pursuing this objective further in future

8912359 with the recent correction in oil price the scenario has stabilised relatively reducing fears of increase in fiscal deficit we also expect inflation to stabilise over the next six months on the fall in oil and monetary and fiscal policies of the government
8912360 high crude oil price and resulting rise in inflation is a major concern for the economy and market we expect inflation to moderate to 8 per cent by march 2009 reliance industries kg basin gas project could help ease the crude crisis
8912361 we are high on cash till the market recovers by second quarter of 2009 we will not go for any nfo on equity side till the time
8912362 we have four new equity schemes to launch of which we have got approval for two but we are waiting for the right timing owing to market conditions nfo expenditure has to be commensurate to the size of the fund
8912363 we are investing in those companies where we find more than 20 per cent wealth creation possibility and in those companies which mobilize money outside and inside the country we maintain a cash position of less than 5 per cent even in this volatile market
8912364 in case of an unstable government there will be a big crash in the markets but a stable government with true intention of reform process can culminate in a recovery spell for the market by the beginning of the third quarter in 2009
8912365 the team did well so i think the manager could quite easily be forgiven for picking the same xi on saturday
8912366 i knew coming back that this was going to be my biggest season yet
8912367 people cant keep relying on me being young any more
8912368 im 21 now and its time for me to step up to the plate and start being a man by taking hold of games and driving the team on hopefully i can get more games under my belt and keep progressing
8912369 we brought in new players during the season and they needed time to settle in here
8912370 it started to come together for us towards the end of last season and we have been able to push on because of it at the start of this season
8912371 everybody knows how the next player plays now and also we have a togetherness in the dressing room
8912372 we have a good group of players we all want to be successful and thats why we are confident that we can have a good season
8912373 we have scored in every game so far so we are confident that we have players who will score goals for us
8912374 i dont really care where the goals come from as long as we score but i think that alves and tuncay will both score a lot of goals this season

8912376 you are meant to be very supportive of each other but he came out in a skin coloured nappy and i just completely lost it
8912377 saul actually did come over and say come on just pull yourself together this is serious work
8912378 thirty days later we are here again and this time radovan karadzic has a choice of pleading either guilty or not guilty
8912379 however if he refuses to enter plea again on this occasion the judge in this case iain bonomy would enter a plea of not guilty in his name in accordance with rules of the tribunal
8912380 esto ilustra lo r pido que puede ser el cerebro de la mosca en procesar la informaci n sensorial en una respuesta motora apropiada
8912381 descubrimos que cuando la mosca realiza movimientos planeados antes de emprender el vuelo tiene en cuenta la posici n de su cuerpo en el momento que detecta la amenaza
8912382 esto significa que la mosca debe integrar informaci n visual de sus ojos que le dice de d nde procede la amenaza con informaci n mecanosensorial de sus patas que le dice c mo moverse para alcanzar la postura adecuada antes de emprender el vuelo
8912383 se transforma en un patr n apropiado de movimientos en patas y cuerpo antes de echar a volar
8912384 while the majority of pet owners are responsible we still see people going away on holiday without making provisions for their pets in addition there are also those who do not want to pay for veterinary care and so either abandon or give up sick animals
8912385 we often pick up sick and elderly animals who may well have owners but because they are reported to us as strays we have a duty to take them in
8912386 the animals can then be rehomed leaving their previous owners with no idea as to what has happened to them simply because the animals had no identification
8912387 this places a huge burden on our animal centres and branches which take in more cats than they can find homes for we are appealing to all owners to microchip their pets it really could mean the difference between losing the animals forever or having them safely home
8912388 neutering is also vital to prevent thousands more cats from becoming unwanted often cats have litters of kittens that owners cannot cope with and so the owners bring them to the rspca and other charities or even abandon them
8912389 our centres have never been so crowded with cats and kittens and its heartbreaking to see so many animals without a permanent home
8912390 some cats have been waiting months for the perfect owner to walk through the door and we hope there may be people out there willing to give these cats a second chance of happiness
8912391 i would advise anyone thinking about taking on a pet to come and visit one of our many animal centres or branches there are so many animals needing help and you would be making a really positive difference to their lives
8912392 this hedgehogs injuries could have been much worse often people are harming or killing wildlife without meaning to and may not even realise that they are breaking the law
8912393 we are therefore urging anyone who is thinking of using traps to take care to ensure that the trap is covered and set in an appropriate place

8912429 a government big enough to give you everything you want is strong enough to take everything you have
8912430 you cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today
8912431 there have been a few people who have hit the ceiling unexpectedly
8912432 well they probably got one off it happens and i cant do anything about it
8912433 well last time you told me to tell you when it happened not later so
8912434 neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these courageous couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds
8912435 i dont have any idea but my gut feeling says it could be alaska gov sarah palin
8912436 i supported romney during the primary process and i think hed make a good choice
8912437 its a good chance for me to meet with my colleagues and represent louisiana in general and specifically the 5th district

8912441 thirty days later we are here again and this time radovan karadzic has a choice of pleading either guilty or not guilty
8912442 however if he refuses to enter plea again on this occasion the judge in this case iain bonomy would enter a plea of not guilty in his name in accordance with rules of the tribunal
8912443 in this accident seat belts were a factor if both were wearing belts these probably would have been minor injuries if the female that expired were wearing a belt she probably would not have died

8912446 my feeling was that fitness is becoming obligatory people are putting on headphones and hopping on machines
8912447 that works for some people but to me joy comes from a sense of community that can be shared together in one inspirational setting
8912448 i had harbored hopes but i dont know that i really knew what it would feel like in this room
8912449 i didnt realize i would find myself re creating such a lovely building but as more of it was revealed it just was the logical conclusion to bring it all the way back to this if i could

8912451 i knew when she was hungry she always stuck out her tongue
8912452 never still she always had her arms and legs moving
8912453 she loved her uncle jamey always keeping a tight grip on his thumb and she loved to suck her own thumb when she could find it

8912456 det er min vurdering at politiet skulle v re k rt derud med en patrulje for at se til kvinden og vurdere om der var behov for at hun skulle i detentionen p sygehuset eller k res hjem
8912457 det er ligsyn i dag og hun vil blive obduceret i n ste uge
8912458 det kan v re at man kan f en op holdstilladelse efter to dage det er en konkret vurdering
8912459 pointen er at man ikke kan sige en uge for man kan ogs f ophold efter to dage det er den konkrete bed mmelse som afg r det

8912536 selee thompson told me to not go to the barracks because doe troops had opened a corridor from the sda school and as soon as i got into that corridor i would have been killed he informed me about the plot to kill me the first law of nature is self preservation
8912537 an unexpected samuel doe decided to visit the freeport of monrovia in my control territory because the peacekeepers came to liberia and failed to visit him doe said the visit was intended to ask ecomog why they came into the country and did not paid a courtesy call on him he thought that he was the town chief and when a stranger comes to the town they must meet the chief first
8912538 mira es que la verdad ya ni vale la pena tomar en serio a la diputada ruth zabaleta debe ser duro que ya en unos d as deja de ser presidenta de la mesa directiva se le acaba su situaci n del escenario que tuvo del peso que han tenido sus declaraciones las m s de ellas desafortunadas lamentablemente y esta ltima que hace es de una irresponsabilidad lamentable salir a decir que hab a bombas molotov cuando en realidad todo mundo vio que hab a una batalla cuerpo a cuerpo del presidium de la c mara de diputados de la tribuna el pan la tom los partidos del frente amplio progresista tambi n al final hubo agresiones inclusive de la derecha
8912539 entonces salir a decir eso que hab a bombas molotov de veras que es de una ligereza imperdonable pero yo digo que ya ni hacerle caso
8912540 es evidente que la lucha ha sido legal ha sido pac fica ha sido con firmeza ahora s como dec a el general anaya si hubi ramos tenido parque no hubiera tomado protesta calder n la verdad si hubiera habido bombas molotov y todo eso no hubiera tomado protesta no era as
8912541 yo no quisiera plantear alguna cosa de ese tipo porque se revive otra vez yo he demostrado que ella ha claudicado y me parece que eso es lo importante que a los ojos de todo mundo es evidente su claudicaci n me parece que la peor sanci n es esa una sanci n moral una sanci n
8912542 pues s m s que pol tica moral de que todo el mundo sepa que ha claudicado y que ese es un desprestigio personal que debe ser duro cargarlo francamente y m s ahora que se va a quedar sola despu s de terminar su periodo como presidenta de la c mara
8912543 yo creo que va a sentir la soledad en pol tica esas cosas son muy duras son terribles cuando est s todo mundo te hace caravanas y cuando dejas de ser pues la aterrizada es medio dura no y para alguien como ella que ha sido bastante superflua me parece que va a ser m s duro el aterrizaje
8912544 en pol tica nadie est completamente muerto nunca pero a m me parece que una vez que ha servido a la derecha la derecha es muy ingrata la pol tica es muy ingrata y la derecha es m s entonces no creo que le vayan a dar ninguna cabida

8912547 if you work for someone else as a digital professional in any sort and also blog you have to be able to speak freely
8912548 i look for every opportunity that makes sense for me
8912549 i thought itd be a good songwriting exercise we didnt think itd really go anywhere
8912550 four or five years ago i was at a place in my life like that
8912551 i bought a book hope dies last the inside cover has the inscription la esperanza muere por ltimo hope dies last in spanish i had that tattooed on my right arm
8912552 we were so focused the words really poured out in a stream of consciousness way
8912553 ive been doing this for more than ten years just trying to make music now another world the film industry is opening doors it just shows youve got to consider every opportunity
8912554 today were writing for another movie a remake of fame
8912555 the number of deaths in the riots was very high mainly because of the brutal repression of the protests by the bir people are now too afraid to speak out against anything because of the repression of those demonstrations
8912556 nothing could justify such a punitive action since the bir already has a clear mission and the youths protests against miserable living conditions were legitimate
8912557 this was a special operation and as a general rule the bir does not operate in cities but in this case the countrys security was threatened and we had to do everything possible to restore peace
8912558 the bir must secure a vast territory for its actions to be effective it would need to increase its staff to at least 3 000 and to not be sidetracked for police or gendarmerie operations
8912559 the elements of this unit have been trained for a specific mission they are unable to cope with rebel armies
8912560 i dont think it really changes our approach the goal is still to win the district championship
8912561 at the same time its nice to know that if you happen to be in a district with another strong team it doesnt automatically eliminate one of you from advancing
8912562 i still think its important that a team be judged on its whole body of work not just on the last three games of the season
8912563 if a team can get hot or get healthy enough to win a district more power to them but ive been on both sides of that 9 1 thing and ill tell you its not much fun when you lose just one game and your season is over
8912564 as long as i can remember even back before i was directly involved with football weve had complaints about the playoff system
8912565 wed get all sorts of suggestions but nothing that everyone could agree upon
8912566 anything that gets more kids involved that allows more teams and schools to experience playoff football is a good thing
8912567 in most cases the teams that are supposed to win are going to come out on top but theres something wrong with a system that doesnt allow a 9 1 team to advance and hopefully this system helps correct that
8912568 last year id say between one third and one fourth of the playoff spots were decided before the final weekend
8912569 giving more kids an opportunity to experience playoff football is a good thing at the same time you dont want to water it down too much
8912570 the last thing you want is a system like the nhl where everybody makes the playoffs
8912571 as a football fan what id like to see is a system that would bring together the best two teams in the state for the championship

8912601 parents can be counseled that infants delivered before 24 weeks are not likely to survive and those who do are not likely to survive intact disabilities in mental and psychomotor development neuromotor function or sensory and communication function are present in approximately one half of survivors
8912602 why does the conversation always default to late term abortion oh right because late term abortion is more dramatic
8912603 of all us sperms only one of us is going to make it to the egg and that is going to be me
8912604 as bbb points out it could be that they think theyve lost the war around abortion per se so theyre focusing on the later terms

8912612 the jammu and kashmir problem has already taken a very serious turn as the state is heading toward splitting into communal lines but if the indian government does not take control of the situation by dialogue first and then if need be use even force jammu and kashmir could become a precarious region for not only india but also for the whole world
8912613 an immediate initiative for a dialogue to facilitate a suspension of the agitation and a peaceful resolution
8912614 it was solely due to the administrative incompetence of the indian government and the government of j amp k that the state has turned into a sectarian and separatist problem
8912615 there has been a complete misinterpretation of the situation of j amp k for many years with overwhelming focus only on declining terrorism whereas no one has paid attention to the motives and efforts of pakistanis and the pakistan backed groups
8912616 over the past year and a half these forces have used various issues to destabilize the region and provoke greater street mobilization in favor of the separatism and radical elements in pakistan and j amp k

8912683 el agua dada la trascendencia que tiene para la vida humana el agua realmente est dentro de la categor a de los derechos humanos
8912684 comprobamos c mo los recursos naturales son extra dos y contaminados por el ego smo de algunos de intereses de grupos de poder amparados por el actual modelo econ mico en perjuicio de los pobres los campesinos y los ind genas un cuidado especial merece el recurso del agua que empieza a ser escaso convirti ndose en el mediano plazo en fuente de conflictos en el mundo

8912708 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
8912709 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo

8912721 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
8912722 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
8912723 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio

8912864 existe um pacote de produtos que interessa o argentino temos 30 posi es que demonstrar o o que a argentina tem a oferecer e vamos querer saber o que o amap tem a nos oferecer ent o essa coopera o pode ser muito produtiva o brasil o primeiro parceiro comercial da argentina ent o porque n o conhecer esse pa s por inteiro porque politicamente falando consideramos o brasil como um todo
8912865 voc s me perguntam o que me interessa aqui eu digo que tudo nos interessa vamos ver o que podemos comprar fabricar aos poucos estamos descobrindo o amap mas faz parte da nossa filosofia pol tica estrat gico pois se somos parceiros devemos abrir oportunidades para todos

8912872 we have nothing against the greenery but it takes 20 30 years before it would fend off the noise
8912873 im not going to be there i plan to be at the state fair you can draw your conclusion from that
8912874 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8912875 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8912876 its very very important that we play the way we practiced and trained over the last year and a half
8912877 theres a way that we operate theres a chain of command theres a way that we interact with each other and we cant afford to be in a disorganized way as we confront the challenges that were going to see here
8912878 we plan to sit in a bar and watch the whole thing
8912879 recalls can take time and the commission felt that time was of the essence and that warning the public about this product was so important that we could not wait until a recall was announced
8912880 we are working with the supplier and cpsc and are directing store managers to remove product identified in the cpsc press release from store shelves and initiating a register block to prevent sale
8912881 in addition we are in the process of removing this product from sale at walmart com
8912882 it is now clear what the foreseeable danger with this product is
8912883 the fact that we have put out this warning pretty much has determined that this is a product that should not be used by consumers
8912884 has refused to cooperate with the government and recall the products sfca maintains that it is not responsible for products previously manufactured by simplicity inc
8912885 all bassinets produced and sold by sfca are produced in this manner with fabric permanently attached over the lower bar and meet or exceed astm standards and cpsc guidelines
8912886 its rather obvious when you look at this bassinet that its defective and dangerous
8912887 the problem is that people dont think in those terms when you go to wal mart and find something covered with walt disneys winnie the pooh you dont think like that
8912888 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision i think well all hear from him shortly and hopefully well be able to move forward together
8912889 we should take advantage of all the wind in this area
8912890 were very much in favour of wind turbines if theyre in the right place but whether theyre in the right place here is questionable
8912891 the only thing green about this is the money the company is making
8912892 were not looking to overrun the county with turbines as some of our competitors are
8912893 thats why we chose a sparsely populated area of the county
8912894 were the ones that will have these things here our residents are going to be the ones dealing with any ill effects i think the town deserves a bigger cut of the revenue it would generate
8912895 if it were the town taking two thirds or three fourths i wouldnt complain
8912896 we need money to reinforce the budget at the town level
8912897 i think the legislature would have more of a tangential role though
8912898 an awful lot of those details go the public service commission of wisconsin
8912899 and each proposal is different we need to be flexible
8912900 if a proposal to shift revenues does go forward then well discuss it
8912901 but i think the towns should be getting more and id be interested in having the state look into it
8912902 but nan has got a moustache grandpa hasnt got shiny teeth

8912906 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8912907 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent

8912918 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans
8912919 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8912920 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8912921 to end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in afghanistan
8912922 not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington

8912956 there will be no other changes to the application the number and position of the turbines will be unchanged
8912957 i am currently awaiting the submission of additional information from energiekontor clarifying the extent of the changes required to address the mods concerns

8913017 the israeli authorities have for many years applied a discriminatory policy of house demolitions permitting on the one hand many tens of israeli settlements to be built on occupied palestinian territory in flagrant violation of international law at the same time as they confiscate palestinian lands forbidding the palestinian population to build and destroying their houses the cleared land is often used to build illegal israeli settlements international law prohibits occupying powers from building settlements for their own citizens on the territories they occupy
8913018 in his 1965 autobiography edward bernays recalls a dinner at his home in 1933 where karl von weigand foreign correspondent of the hearst newspapers an old hand at interpreting europe and just returned from germany was telling us about goebbels and his propaganda plans to consolidate nazi power

8913022 the swas code has taken on board the frequent criticism of self regulatory codes that they are soft on enforcement by introducing mechanisms to fine name and shame and ultimately expel a member continually breaching the code
8913023 this is a welcome dimension and one that alcohol focus scotland would like to see introduced into the codes of similar bodies
8913024 the code is well used by swa members seeking advice on its application and enjoys the benefit of having no official complaints lodged since its introduction this is a measure of the positive value and effectiveness of the code the audit findings have also provided swa members with some issues to consider which can only improve the codes effectiveness in the future

8913045 that night we knew it was one of two cancers
8913046 the tumor at that point was so large she was in a tremendous amount of pain
8913047 so i litterally sat there in the crib with her and held her it just so happened she liked snow white so i watched 73 hours straight of snow white
8913048 i was frustrated that there wasnt enough cancer funding and not enough research was getting done and i just decided that i was going to ask all of my friends to give up lunch that next day and give 5 or 10 to the childrens neuroblastoma cancer foundation to be used for neuroblastoma research
8913049 i absolutely despise the fact the fact that my daughter has cancer
8913050 i absolutely love what it has done to our family that we appreciate life and we appreciate what we have and that we can make a difference in other peoples lives
8913051 ask s for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8913052 based on the available information and reports it appears that this outbreak is over
8913053 by early august the number of cases was down to the number of cases we would expect to see anyway in the absence of a major outbreak there are some cases of this infection that occur every year
8913054 this is also an important indication that this particular outbreak is over
8913055 in addition tomatoes were possibly a source particularly early in the outbreak
8913056 as a result of that initiative the fda has identified shipments of produce from mexico which tested positive for strains of salmonella other than the salmonella saintpaul strain
8913057 in cases where contamination was discovered on imported produce the fda has refused the entry and has imposed appropriate import controls on a shipper specific basis to prevent the entry of contaminated product into the u s market
8913058 these foods include certain types of fresh produce that have been repeatedly associated with adverse health events

8913063 antipsychotics are effective in treating potentially very distressing psychiatric symptoms but as with all drugs their use can be associated with a range of benefits and possible side effects
8913064 this study has further clarified the potential for antipsychotics to increase the risk of stroke
8913065 this risk is substantially higher in patients with dementia than those without these findings need to be factored into prescribing decisions made by doctors caring for patients with often distressing and difficult to treat psychiatric symptoms
8913066 we believe that the risks associated with antipsychotic use in patients with dementia generally outweigh the potential benefits and in this patient group use of antipsychotic drugs should be avoided wherever possible
8913067 for other patients careful consideration must be given to the likely individual risks and benefits of any prescribing decision
8913068 important topic and elevates the concern about risks of antipsychotics to a whole new level the fda u s food and drug administration might investigate whether availability limitations or warning labeling should be imposed

8913070 one is that they dont know how to walk not walking they become deconditioned and lose cardiovascular fitness with the treadmill type of training you improve walking and also increase fitness
8913071 the most important clinical aspect of the study is that it is saying recovery can occur long after a stroke and can occur even after all the routine therapies have been tried
8913072 scientifically the most important point appears to be that rewiring of the brain may be involved in this process not just body conditioning
8913073 the average stroke patient now has about eight physical therapy sessions over six to 12 weeks
8913074 should be part of standard treatment for every stroke survivor who has a walking habit
8913075 most physical therapy departments have treadmills but they dont use them to the extent that we used them in the study
8913076 because this is exhausting it should always be done under supervision
8913077 there is always the risk of running into heart problems and falling we used special treadmills with handrails and also monitored the heart rate to achieve the level of exertion we needed
8913078 it is probably not advisable to drive before six weeks after bunion surgery on the right foot our research shows that the reflexes and the power required to brake suddenly in an emergency is fully returned only at six weeks in the post operative period
8913079 however it is extremely important for all patients to discuss when they can return to driving with their surgeon after having any type of surgery to their foot
8913080 sadly we frequently see patients admitted to a hospital with a devastating stroke who are known to have atrial fibrillation yet were either not taking warfarin or were taking a dose that is not therapeutic we consider these to be potentially preventable strokes
8913081 on one hand we have an extremely effective and cheap medication for stroke prevention warfarin yet on the other hand it remains under used in people who would benefit most from it
8913082 this is a public health priority because atrial fibrillation is one of the most common causes of stroke
8913083 many more strokes could be prevented if anti coagulation therapy were optimized in the population at large
8913084 this is mainly because its a hassle however this study confirms that many strokes can be avoided if patients are adequately anti coagulated therefore both patients and doctors need to do a better job of overcoming the inconvenience of warfarin
8913085 warfarin is usually the best and safest available treatment to prevent stroke in people with atrial fibrillation increasing the uptake of warfarin would reduce the risk of death and disability of stroke
8913086 the pilot has done a great job in landing the plane safely
8913087 older people with any physical vulnerability are about 13 percent more likely than those without one to report verbal mistreatment but are not more likely to report financial mistreatment
8913088 perhaps the respondents are including fairly routine arguments perhaps about money with their spouse sibling or child in their reports or perhaps older adults are more reticent to report negative behavior
8913089 the population of this country is aging and people now live with chronic diseases longer so its important to understand from a health perspective how people are being treated as they age
8913090 we cant at this point rule out a very early spike in amyloid right after a brain injury
8913091 we havent measured how brain injury affects amyloid beta inside cells nor have we determined whether brain injury affects the ability of amyloid beta to form small aggregates that may be especially harmful
8913092 our ultimate goal is to develop interventions that we can apply after a traumatic brain injury to improve outcomes and reduce the long term risk of alzheimers
8913093 the study suggests that the critical ingredient in smoking that may be causing emphysema is cadmium a well known contaminant of cigarette smoke the worry is if you are exposed to this cadmium through other sources you can also be at risk for emphysema
8913094 with a larger population we will be able to better disentangle the independent effects of cadmium and smoking and whether dietary cadmium or other non cigarette sources may also influence lung function
8913095 on average caregivers only slept about six and a half hours a night and took almost 23 minutes to fall asleep
8913096 using the sleep diary data that subjects kept at the same time however depression was the primary determinant of poor sleep with depressed subjects reporting less time asleep and more wake time over the week
8913097 our data seems to point toward the inherent decision that is made when the tumor is formed whether it is highly malignant or not moreover since the characteristic might be dependent on the normal cell status one might imagine that they might be different between individuals
8913098 this does suggest that cells can sit for a long time then be activated
8913099 but these cells were injected into the circulation normal breast cells are not supposed to be in the circulation
8913100 cells that did not have any oncogenes in them and do not transform spontaneously as per all published studies we could see little colonies of these cells when we inspected the lungs
8913101 at no point never did we see a solid vision that would resemble metastatic colonies but it appears that every time we looked at the animal the colonies appeared to be larger
8913102 its an important step to show whether or not the first step of the metastatic cascade is something a normal cell can accomplish
8913103 its a short term solution because were using antibiotics more than wed like but it is working
8913104 it reduces the amount of group b strep in the vagina so there is less exposure to the baby during delivery
8913105 some of the estimates are more than twice that number are being given antibiotics because people arent following the protocol closely
8913106 they should get to the hospital early enough to get their antibiotics and they need to be aware of signs of illness so theyre ready to get their baby in for treatment immediately
8913107 no way around it the confederate flag represents racism plain and simple your heritage is whites only
8913108 there is no reason to suppose that all of these have been derived from a common source

8913318 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8913319 i think for the first 18 months anybody who comes into office will be cleaning up the bush legacy and then after that i think hes really going to start implementing the change hes put forth in his platform so im not concerned at all
8913320 it would be silly not to use that sort of emotion for our benefit in this game
8913321 those three guys have been outstanding for this club and it would be sad to see them come off the field for the last time we have to make sure we play well and bring a bit happiness to the occasion as well

8913340 we havent had as many out of town entries as we normally would
8913341 a lot of people who live in cape town durban bloemfontein and would normally come we just didnt see our entries would have been 100 dogs more if the petrol price had been a lot less
8913342 as soon as petrol started to go up people said sorry not going do i need to go from johannesburg to a dog show in cape town from r2000 petrol costs have gone up to r4500 we dont use trailers to cart our dogs around in a lot of people do use trailers and that really chews up the petrol
8913343 the market is starting to shrink a bit thats on the back of seven years of pretty good growth theres definitely a slowdown in travel overall
8913344 weve not seen it in our numbers but overall the domestic air travel market is down between five and 10 compared with the same time last year we are expecting it to get quite a bit worse
8913345 this year was special and nothing last year prepared people for what happened this year
8913346 when you go around as i do and ask people do you recognise any of this i get the same kind of response in so many walks of life whats happened this year is remarkably abrupt and is on a scale not experienced before

8913353 the manufacturers want to say we have a fuel efficient car and we have a car that on the carbon emiss ions side is very acceptable theyre using it as a mechanism to say buy responsibly

8913355 your household sector could at that point start to turn if people dont think it is a false signal
8913356 christmas never fails to come but i think its going to come much much later when people think i can throw caution to the wind six days before christmas day weve been through times like this before
8913357 what we did was leave the entries open rather than have a cut off time like we normally would we left entries till four to five days before the show what also contributed was that a payday coincided with the late stage for entries so more disposable income was available

8913410 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever

8913416 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
8913417 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant

8913466 im really honored that these bands all agreed to play its going to be a great night
8913467 at some point i realized that i didnt want to sound exactly like on my albums
8913468 so i stripped down to just me on acoustic guitar with natalia on vocals
8913469 and then we started to build back up from scratch
8913470 it was a very good experience to try to rearrange the songs and see how they sounded in a simple environment
8913471 it gave me a lot of confidence a good song should be independent from arrangements if its balanced well written properly composed you should be able to arrange it with strings or play it with a rock band
8913472 i learned to select my material a lot better and be more selective with my arrangements and then when it comes to the beats since theyre djs they have a really good ear
8913473 they encouraged me to make the latin aspect more obvious
8913474 i balance a lot of elements that are not routine or orthodox
8913475 the latin element is there in the spanish lyrics and guitar but on the other hand i use a lot of elements that have nothing to do with latin culture the combination looking for the right balance thats what creates the atmosphere

8913483 much like everything on the web how many people go to the site how long they spend are key
8913484 does that always translate into ticket sales certainly not but its important for the brand and for our mission to get people to love classical music
8913485 i think thats great given that elliott carter is not mainstream programming its not just an entertainment thing its an opportunity for distance learning and that for us is an important component

8913508 the possibility that republican presidential nominee john mccain might choose democratic sen joseph lieberman as his running mate has sent the right into a tizzy there are many arguments for and against such a decision but the debate so far has assumed such a selection would be unprecedented it wouldnt abraham lincoln chose former democrat andrew johnson as his vice president in 1864 that episode ended unhappily for reasons directly relevant to the current situation republicans in 1864 like republicans today faced uncertain election prospects in the middle of a war whose outcome and popularity were also uncertain lincoln maneuvered within his party in the first half of the year to forestall a serious challenge from unhappy party activists but even after he was renominated he despaired of re election with the survival of the union at stake it was not surprising that lincoln and republican stalwarts sought to broaden the partys appeal to those democrats who supported the war effort their gaze turned toward tennessee sen andrew johnson the only senator from a secessionist state who had not abandoned congress staunchly pro union johnson was unfailing in his efforts on behalf of lincolns war efforts with victory on the battlefield uncertain the republicans cast aside sitting vice president hannibal hamlin they even renamed the party to make clear the issue on which the election would be fought lincoln and johnson were nominated on the national union party ticket these calculations made sense under the circumstances the civil war was the only issue that mattered to the electorate all domestic issues were swept aside in its path the democrats platform condemned the war as a failure advocated cessation of hostilities and contemplated negotiation with the south in short the 1864 democrats were a party of peace over victory while the national unionists were a party of peace through victory since the future of the war was essential to the future of the nation all other considerations had to be cast aside but the republicans would have cause to rue their choice following the partys june convention democratic hopes for the presidency would begin to fade as union forces began to roll up victories on the battlefield and after the election victory in the war became apparent by april 1865 a mere one month after lincolns re inauguration the south surrendered but lincoln was also dead and a republican dominated congress had to deal with a lifelong democrat as president johnson shared republican party war aims but little else he did not approve of the domestic policy of the republican majority hed spent a career attacking whig and republican efforts to improve the economy through encouragement of private enterprise as efforts to empower the rich at the expense of the common man whats more he strongly disagreed with the republican approach toward dealing with the south and the newly freed slaves his policies including a veto of the first civil rights act and opposition to the 14th amendment caused so much friction that he became the first president to be impeached by congress and came within one vote from being removed from office
8913509 our analysis of the preliminary information about the trial initially released by the police indicated that more than 40 of incidents between just september 2006 and march 2007 were in breach of the standard operating procedures sop drawn up to regulate taser use during the trial period
8913510 the police commissioners decision has been made despite repeated calls for delay until the public had had the opportunity to view and comment on all relevant information about the trial not just the summaries released by police which the chief ombudsman called
8913511 there has been no public discussion of these concerns and without the complete set of information about the new zealand trial it has not even been possible for the public to properly assess the trial the trial has been run by police assessed by police and now the decision has been made by police with no transparency or openness in the process
8913512 transparency is especially important in a trial which is supposed to provide an opportunity for reflection and considered debate this trial has had neither
8913513 the police commissioner said that the debate in the house on wednesday did not raise any new issues that is no wonder how can the matter be properly debated when most of the relevant information is kept secret a decision such as this which will change the face of policing in new zealand should be subject to a rigorous democratic process and public scrutiny the decision is both unprincipled and dangerous and the lack of process and transparency around it is unacceptable in a modern democracy

8913801 mr wilsons central involvement in the cold war in south asia does not warrant the honor of establishing a university chair in his name
8913802 a named chair sends a public message that not only the holder of the chair but its donor represent standards to which the university and larger community should aspire
8913803 theres a range of sentiments from mild to outrage truly we had assumed this thing was not going to go anywhere

8913829 he gives us a sense that america can be great once again
8913830 this country cant survive the direction its been going in and hes a strong candidate to make that change
8913831 this follows every other technology that turns out to have information of forensic value i think what were seeing is evolutionary
8913832 what were dealing with here is a use of the technology that i dont think the good people at magellan or garmin or tomtom really thought about when they were developing it
8913833 typically the gps data being used is for the purpose of contradicting defendants alibis
8913834 under state law we have the ability to insist that something that is being printed on ballot material that will go out to every voter should be factually correct

8913836 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8913837 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8913838 al lami was a moderate official and we are surprised by his arrest
8913839 the man has been known to travel in and out of iraq to neighboring nations including iran and lebanon where it is believed he meets and helps run the iranian backed special groups in iraq
8913840 fighting and confronting saddams regime despite the risks that surrounded him
8913841 the americans know very well that such people were brought up and trained in the iranian intelligence system
8913842 the detention of al lami is part of a chain of events that will lead to the uncovering of others
8913843 none of us can provide a cast iron guarantee that salmonella saintpaul will not re emerge
8913844 is an important indication that this particular outbreak is over
8913845 we continue to believe that association could reflect real contamination early on
8913846 it is information that is more restricted in time and does not have confirmatory laboratory findings behind it
8913847 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
8913848 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8913849 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8913850 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8913851 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8913852 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8913853 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8913854 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8913855 the participants underscore the need for respect of the historical and cultural traditions of each country and each people and for efforts aimed at preserving the unity of the state and its territorial integrity

8913866 i watched her all week she was being tortured every day
8913867 i told her she gave me my son back it was something i needed to say
8913868 i dont think they are going to put on a case in the future with a lack of evidence
8913869 after all this they are still my brothers i wish them the best
8913870 i still believe this case should have went before a military court for the simple fact that military jurors have an easier time understanding what happens in combat
8913871 it kind of made a mountain out of a molehill
8913872 there was no dispute the tribe made political contributions that happens every day
8913873 the indians got lied to and cheated by their own people and the governments letting them get away with it

8913875 would you rather face a possible four years in prison for perjury or tell the truth now about what happened
8913876 both played against russia exactly how we asked them to play
8913877 they controlled the match set the pace and won the most battles for the ball
8913878 it opens the road for all of latin america to start visualizing legal paths to abortion
8913879 its not up to the supreme court to legalize or criminalize abortion

8913890 units often let us know in advance when a claim is coming our way
8913891 in these cases the units do a lot of the ground work and make it easy for us to fulfill these claims
8913892 sometimes innocent people get caught in the wrong place at the wrong time

8913896 t hese proposals at least on their face are not on the scale of the philosophically similar proposals imposed by hugo chavez ut they are based on the same philosophy of law and economics namely that such policies are of economic benefit to the poor
8913897 the progressive personal income tax the corporate income tax the inheritance tax and the capital gains tax are all paid with funds that otherwise would have been saved and invested all of them reduce the demand for labor
8913898 t hese proposals at least on their face are not on the scale of the philosophically similar proposals imposed by hugo chavez b ut they are based on the same philosophy of law and economics namely that such policies are of economic benefit to the poor
8913899 the progressive personal income tax the corporate income tax the inheritance tax and the capital gains tax are all paid with funds that otherwise would have been saved and invested all of them reduce the demand for labor
8913900 they deprive business firms of the funds with which to buy capital goods
8913901 a reduction in the degree of capital intensiveness in the economic system and thus its ability to implement technological advances
8913902 i would not rule out the possibility that at some point we may need to tap into short term lines of credit with the treasury for working capital not to cover our losses with a rise in the number of troubled banks the fdics deposit insurance fund used to repay insured deposits at failed banks has been drained
8913903 the greatest battles of life are fought out every day in the silent chambers of ones own soul

8913913 certainly for the particle physicists its the biggest project of everyones career
8913914 but more than every other project the rest of the physics community knows whats going on too theyre aware that something big is happening
8913915 were too concerned with getting the machine up and running to think about that
8913916 and hopefully we can demonstrate its relevance in the uk and worldwide
8913917 the technological spin offs to me theyre an aside a project like this is inspiring and thats what encourages young people thats what encouraged me people go into it because its exciting and cutting edge and you need almost no argument except that the biggest benefit of the moon landings was the new generation of scientists that they inspired
8913918 its a leap into the dark in a way that no particle accelerator has been before were at the limit of our capabilities the closest thing i think weve done is gone to the moon
8913919 the unknown is always very exciting for physicists put it this way well be surprised if there isnt a surprise
8913920 overheidsbedrijven zoals belgacom zouden beter geprivatiseerd worden de rol van de overheid is in de eerste plaats de voorwaarden cre ren voor een competitieve goedwerkende markt het is niet aan de overheid om zelf een marktspeler te zijn met in dit geval een quasi monopoliepositie er bovenop
8913921 de overheid moet zorgen dat de consument profiteert van scherpe concurrentie dit is vandaag nog altijd niet het geval belgacom schermt de markt af
8913922 i think this is going to be a very competitive riding
8913923 i think a lot of the leaders hit the big cities

8913937 if luol doesnt participate this season or any other season leading up to london there is no question our involvement is in doubt
8913938 if we fall out of the a division next year and cannot participate in the a division for the 2011 european championships there is a real possibility we will not play in london
8913939 if it does work out well it will probably be a small plus for us
8913940 obviously if it doesnt work out well then the republicans are going to have a problem
8913941 its more of a problem if youre the guy living in the eye of the storm
8913942 our concern is for the lives in the storms potential path

8913956 we thought if we gave people something fun to do then maybe they will forget about the difficult economy
8913957 we dont really know why the bottle failed and thats the key question for the investigation
8913958 sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents
8913959 the preliminary report was a factual account of the incident and investigation to date
8913960 i think we all had fun once we knew it was all safe
8913961 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
8913962 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8913963 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8913964 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8913965 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8913966 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8913967 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8913968 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8913969 we try and keep our industry out of politics and into marketing opportunities but sometimes its very difficult to separate the two
8913970 at this point if russia were to walk back from certain agreements they have made it would clearly delay any future aspirations they have of joining the world trade organization
8913971 the soviet union was not so alone even in 1968
8913972 trying to draw up a strong text signifying our unwillingness to accept
8913973 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
8913974 it opens the road for all of latin america to start visualizing legal paths to abortion
8913975 this tragedy we are living in mexico city is going to spread to other states
8913976 this decision was in regard to mexico citys legislative assembly but in the end it establishes a precedent that can be applied to other local lawmaking bodies
8913977 its not up to the supreme court to legalize or criminalize abortion
8913978 they are just encouraging women to be dirty and loose
8913979 the justices decision is only going to spread more irresponsible behavior
8913980 im finally getting pretty good at this and have learned many lessons the hard way
8913981 so they throw this asset away and send me home
8913982 but just as race isnt used as a proxy age shouldnt be either
8913983 the planet is not going to stop spinning if im wrong
8913984 i would have said keep your head under the parapet and work the system
8913985 but i find they dont study history to be able to make the best decisions for their companies
8913986 they made money so quickly and in such vast quantities
8913987 that they didnt realize they could lose it twice as fast
8913988 reasonably large and permanent concentration of people within a limited territory
8913989 this definition matches the structure of the ancient amazonian societies as heckenberger and his team describe them
8913990 under my leadership pride will continue to diversify and obtain sales from each and every segment of the u s defense budget while we deliver to our military forces the very best products used to defend our great nation
8913991 we continue to concentrate on building our management team and bringing pride current in its reporting and other requirements of good corporate governance
8913992 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision i think well all hear from him shortly and hopefully well be able to move forward together
8913993 weve been a band for ten years and this is probably the coolest thing weve ever done
8913994 ill have to be honest with you though none of you seems prepared to beat the broncos you dont have your shoulder pads or anything
8913995 weve got to make this country work again this is our moment to change the course of history
8913996 were standing on the doorstep of history and were very honored to be here
8913997 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8913998 are too serious the stakes too high for this same partisan playbook

8914003 when i was drowning with my family underwater in the darkness i could literally sense the peace of god assuring me that they were all going to heaven and that it was all going to be ok rogers writes on his web site
8914004 there was no pain there was no fear i continued to simply trust god somehow he pulled me above the rapids and over to the shore its a miracle im alive
8914005 this is not something that is routine but it is something that the oil industry has done over and over again over the years
8914006 chevron has been operating in the gulf of mexico for more than 60 years certainly there is hurricane season every year

8914009 its truly an honor to receive this award and to be associated with ron burton the work that i do in the community pales in comparison to what he was able to do in his lifetime but its an honor i thank the organization for giving me this award and i thank my teammates for supporting the work that we do with the military its about the troops any time weve had the larryoke event its been about the troops and supporting them and their families because theyre the ones that need it the most im just happy to be in a position where i can put an event together that brings attention to the sacrifices theyre making and raise a little money while having a little fun
8914010 i will not be in dayton ohio so i think thats a fair assumption
8914011 im glad you guys will quit following me around so much

8914014 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
8914015 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government

8914020 its always fun though i dont think theres anyone going to try laying anyone out
8914021 if youve got an event the size of the olympics and youve got billions and billions of people watching it you definitely have a backing track and mime to it because anything could go wrong
8914022 its just a safety first thing you cannot take the risk
8914023 we share artists all the time and conductors all the time
8914024 it was all prerecorded and the mso melbourne symphony orchestra did record a minority of the music that was performed
8914025 its correct that we were basically miming to a pre recording
8914026 we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8914027 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8914028 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8914029 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8914030 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8914031 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time
8914032 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
8914033 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists that actually attacked us on 9 11
8914034 you know john mccain likes to say he will follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8914035 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8914036 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8914037 doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8914038 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8914039 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
8914040 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man
8914041 if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8914042 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8914043 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8914044 theyre going to have to extend the length of the vice presidential debate to two or three hours because i dont think hes going to be able to fit his part of the debate in just one hour
8914045 we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8914046 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8914047 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time
8914048 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
8914049 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8914050 he personalized his story he humanized his story but what he also did was he punched back at all the accusations and criticism that john mccain has been saying that he is a celebrity that he is elitist
8914051 he said look i come from humble beginnings i know people are hurting out there
8914052 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8914053 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush

8914059 i just told tony today youre the love of my life i dont really ever say that to anybody
8914060 it is not a merger investigation and has no specific deadline
8914061 the proposals would create a monster monopoly which would mean that ba aa and iberia would be way too dominant on key routes into and out of heathrow airport
8914062 we all know that monopolies never work in the consumers favor
8914063 germ n truly shares our vision and has shown us that he can handle old narnia songs with finesse but most importantly that he fits perfectly with the material of our coming album germ n grew up in rio de janeiro brazil but moved to sweden in his teens you may have seen and heard him with various bands and artists such as minds eye and mendez to name a few
8914064 the most well sounding and well performed narnia album to date

8914069 promotion of arts is important the defence of their freedom is very important to us
8914070 im health minister tony clement and i have to say i approved this food
8914071 the liberals have abstained sat on their hands walked out on 41 votes in the commons yet still try to tell us that they are the party to lead the country
8914072 promotion of arts is important the defence of their freedom is very important to us
8914073 the liberals have abstained sat on their hands walked out on 41 votes in the commons yet still try to tell us that they are the party to lead the country
8914074 harper said its not a conservative budget that he didnt like it but canadians didnt want an election so he had his caucus abstain
8914075 would be enough to throw the liberals into turmoil and give harper a virtually free hand in parliament for quite a while and really handicap his main opponent
8914076 he said the conservatives are increasingly showing their stripes as a party that wishes to censor the arts and tightly control which programs receive funding
8914077 i may not think dion is the strongest leader but at least he is a voice for those who need it
8914078 trent mw your memory isnt too good the liberals had sent our troops into the conflict not the conservatives
8914079 i can see clearly that the intelect sic of the liberal supporters leaves much to be desired
8914080 better to remain silent and thought of as an idiot then to open your mouth and remove all doubt

8914084 we never in real life tell stories in a linear way
8914085 i think that cinema is a very young medium and its beginning to find its own language and among these languages is the deconstruction of time
8914086 i have been obsessed with the weight of death over the living ones
8914087 my identity is constructed by the people that i love by the people that surround me every time one dies part of my identity is broken and lost i am obsessed at how that loss of someone that i love affects my own identity

8914102 suit makers cant withstand the competition and the downturn in the economy at the same time
8914103 the overall dress up market has changed dramatically in the past 10 years

8914111 last year was tough for him and he probably didnt quite fit as he did in the past
8914112 this is an opportunity to come to a team that i think will definitely use his type of player to his advantage
8914113 he is good down low strong on the puck and he has a great release and a good shot he is capable of being physical and i think our style of play fits him to a t theres no doubt hell be a good fit for our hockey club
8914114 robs passion coupled with the knowledge that he has gained for the past five years with providence make him a good fit for us
8914115 we believe strongly in cultivating talent within the bruins family and rob is a good example of someone who deserved a promotion given his commitment to the organization
8914116 ive told all of our younger guys the same thing if they can make our team ill find room for them
8914117 hes a good skater very smart with an offensive acumen hes a big strong focused kid

8914119 hes keeping himself wound up and getting excited for the season hes raring to go it was tough on him to miss the playoffs hes champing at the bit to get that going
8914120 the kid wants to play another year over there and were fine with that
8914121 im not going to be there i plan to be at the state fair you can draw your conclusion from that
8914122 they were pretty much hustled off they came right down the ramp jumped in some vans here and off they went
8914123 john mccain is going to make the choice from his heart hes going to choose someone who can be a partner in governing hes going to choose someone who brings character and principle to the table and who shares his priorities and im confident that hes going to make a great pick
8914124 we also prayed for the officer and his family because we thought he was hurt
8914125 i know boogie wouldnt shoot the police because he knows he got her
8914126 leading into the event with the information we had on the number of demonstrators i thought we were going to have more difficulties than we did i think the cops are satisfied it was busy but not out of control there were no major incidents or injuries
8914127 gives them a 15 were not flawless but this was pretty close
8914128 they got the message to come downtown and enjoy it
8914129 and i think they needed to feel secure when they did that the security was necessary to make people feel safe mission accomplished
8914130 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
8914131 i can tell you that directing was maybe the happiest moment of my professional life just arriving on set i had a smile and it hasnt vanished until now
8914132 we never in real life tell stories in a linear way
8914133 i think that cinema is a very young medium and its beginning to find its own language and among these languages is the deconstruction of time
8914134 i have been obsessed with the weight of death over the living ones
8914135 my identity is constructed by the people that i love by the people that surround me every time one dies part of my identity is broken and lost i am obsessed at how that loss of someone that i love affects my own identity
8914136 im fascinated by how this industry survives how it struggles
8914137 i dont have to do it every time but its something that i really enjoy when i feel i meet people where were like minded and we walk the same road and tell the same story
8914138 especially i think now in her age more than when she was working in her 30s theres a strength with this leftover vulnerability from her 20s thats just unbelievably beautiful to watch
8914139 here they are covering the process of selecting the president and nobody is covering the actual president
8914140 we are in the process of reevaluating our relationship with russia
8914141 what if they gave a cold war and nobody came
8914142 he went to new orleans and gulfport miss barely got covered
8914143 you have to know what you can say and what you cant say
8914144 you dont get enough information to write something its never enough
8914145 battery life will decrease by a small amount its about 20 minutes maybe 30 minutes and thats because theres a larger power draw with the brighter screen
8914146 witnesses who say they saw me bite him are lying 100 theyre lying
8914147 i dont know whether he was bitten or not but it wasnt by me
8914148 rhiwbina were awarded a penalty but were blocked by opposition players
8914149 both teams started pushing and shoving and jones came face to face with mr hobbs
8914150 jones grabbed hold of his upper arm lent forward and purposely bit him on the left ear without any justification
8914151 hobbs immediately felt a sharp pain and put his hand up to his ear when he pulled his hand back it was covered in blood
8914152 hes a player in an ideal world you would not want to lose but i just want to make it absolutely clear that at the end of the day it was my decision to sell him
8914153 we got an offer that i feel was his value we are all aware james has had a difficult time he almost signed for them once before and was dragged back
8914154 im flattered that a quarter of a million people downloaded my music but how do i survive if theres no compensation for that
8914155 i think its great to have free music art should be free especially for people who cant afford it but im of the opinion that musicians cant survive on thin air either so what do you do
8914156 they wrote a lot of harassing e mails there were a couple of hundred that were pretty aggressive we hope you die that sort of thing
8914157 if youre a musician youll upload your music to the site anyone plays it you get paid anyone downloads it you get paid thats it simple everythings free for the user
8914158 myspace and facebook have 200 million users between them they have got the audience and the content to bring the audience to the website and its going to be a very big undertaking to be able to compete on the same level with that

8914163 i had to crawl back to the bench i could barely catch my breath
8914164 the first time i cried was last thursday when my hair was falling out in my hands
8914165 i told myself get the razor and shave it all off then i was fine
8914166 biased and aimed at justifying the aggressive actions of georgia
8914167 i think the decision will be more in favour of cutting diplomatic ties
8914168 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality he said in tbilisi
8914169 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
8914170 by teaming with ibm iss our objective is to both strengthen our security systems and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our security operations
8914171 working with ibm we believe we can deliver substantial cost savings and offer the business a security solution that is both strong and sustainable
8914172 p amp g is truly ahead of the curve with a radical approach to pre emptive security
8914173 working together weve enhanced the security infrastructure and resiliency around the globe and were helping to reduce the cost of that security with a layered streamlined and managed security strategy in place p amp g can focus on its core business and ultimately better serve its customers

8914175 our workers are not working today we are assessing the situation as of now
8914176 the workers have been urged to leave the factory on their own to express solidarity with us
8914177 as if we had blocked the highway and disrupted movement of goods trucks and other vehicles this is a sinister move to blacken the agitation its far from true that our agitation is responsible for the disruption we have been camping on the edge of the road

8914183 i do not support any bandh but at the same time i am member of a political party so long i have kept mum but now i will speak out
8914184 the politburo publicly censored bhattacharjee on thursday for his comments against strikes as per our party constitution publicly censoring someone is a punishment and the party has given the punishment to him
8914185 strikes are not a luxury but the last weapon of the working class to protest against injustices meted out to them we cannot use this weapon off and on in fact it s the states opposition parties that call strikes every now and then its their conspiracy to poison people s minds about strikes

8914188 the gdp growth numbers are more or less in line with rbis expectations the economic advisory councils expectations and markets expectations and also given the probability of a surge of inflation being relatively low at this time
8914189 there were certainly parts of our business where we were too aggressive
8914190 their products arent that differentiated they can paint their products in different colors or sell them in different geographies but a lot of the other players do the same thing
8914191 they have a passionate base that they went after in a smart way
8914192 rights fees are up attendance is up viewership is up
8914193 somehow the strategy of putting baseball games on every device that has a plug or a battery has worked for the business partners even more important its worked for our fans
8914194 its much more than what you can get on television
8914195 it taps into the base by offering multiple camera angles stats and on demand video
8914196 the attorney general said that the governing phrase in the law is the first phrase that says school districts may offer a course about the bible
8914197 government will keep monitoring the continued effects of prices on our people and will institute such measure t help alleviate their effects on our spending
8914198 the director of phuket international airport decided to temporarily shut down the airport because protesters have trespassed on the parking spots and blocked the runways
8914199 the phuket governor is trying to negotiate with protesters now
8914200 the authority shut down both hat yai and krabi airports soon after phuket was closed because officials are unable to operate
8914201 the duration of the closure will depend on how the situation develops
8914202 we call on our members from every department to exercise their right to take two days sick leave without a doctors certificate because this morning the government attacked people
8914203 the mood of the overwhelming majority of protesters has been peaceable and no serious violence has been reported
8914204 there has been no significant disruption to life and business in the capital beyond added traffic congestion in a few areas
8914205 mark warner apparently does not want the people of virginia to have an opportunity to understand clearly where he stands on the issues
8914206 i believe the people of virginia have a right to see and hear candidates for public office discuss the issues
8914207 governor warner certainly respects the good work done by the league of women voters and we regret that we were not able to commit to their proposal
8914208 i know mark warner is leading in the polls but i find his decision not to debate jim gilmore curious the recent history of politicians who refuse to debate their opponents in virginia is that of defeat
8914209 there are so many vital issues that need to be fully aired for voters of the commonwealth that i ask the league of women voters to hold their debate anyway i would certainly be there and would debate former governor gilmore on any topic that is germane to the u s senate race in virginia this year the voters of virginia deserve no less
8914210 that speech was amazing but its not going to change my mind
8914211 i talk to plenty of people like me who just wont accept an unqualified president
8914212 obama has said a lot of stuff but nothing with a concrete vision
8914213 i have heard at least some sensible things from senator mccain hes a comeback kind of guy and ive heard from many other people who are clearly leaning in his direction

8914221 its an exciting time its always exciting for baseball and for the fans
8914222 the factors that exist would be other parts of the value chain
8914223 the fact of the matter is that in broad terms unemployment has gone nowhere since march 2006
8914224 we are not creating jobs fast enough to meet the official goal of halving unemployment by 2014 and its more difficult to create jobs in a slowing economy
8914225 the numbers are a shocking reflection of the fact that the economy is unable to stimulate satisfactory employment
8914226 we think the school attendance court is a beneficial program in order to aid in getting students back in the classroom so they can increase their learning time
8914227 we have a very proactive approach to education and deterrents
8914228 we have a great community that lets us know when theres something unusual that goes on
8914229 we are just so shocked and saddened that something like this could happen to christopher when he was so optimistic about life and his future
8914230 it shows that addiction is bigger than any amount of love and caring that can be provided

8914244 one of the most persistent comments i hear from clients is how they cant stand to see black bars whether the image is letterboxed or pillarboxed for many people this is really a big deal and edge makes this a simple problem to solve
8914245 another client complains about when football scores are chopped off in the lower right corner of the screen and edges complete control of overscan and underscan will let him see all the information on screen its funny but solving just these little problems is a really big deal for clients and while they probably wouldnt pay 3 000 for it at 799 they wont even blink
8914246 millions of customers have now upgraded to hdtvs but as they add more sources like blu ray players portable media cable boxes and satellite receivers they find themselves running out of ways to connect them to their tv

8914248 this new 799 price point should reinvigorate the relationship between an outboard processor and the new low priced panels

8914301 farmers are more reluctant sell their straw because of the perceived loss of p amp k
8914302 but in addition to this the wet weather has meant people are snatching bits of crop as and when they can they know the straw isnt dry enough for contractors to bale it and theyre keen to get on with cultivations so theyre chopping the straw
8914303 were well up against it because the straw just isnt drying out unlike arable farmers with grain driers we cant buy the sunshine so we just have to wait it out
8914304 what that means of course is that farmers cant get onto the fields to cultivate them and start drilling the rape consequently more and more of them are chopping the straw from remaining standing crops even if its just to give their blokes some ground to work down
8914305 straw prices are going to hit 50 60 t which works out to about 20 bale thats very expensive bedding livestock farmers are going to have to look at alternatives like shredded paper waste
8914306 not only is the apparatus constructed on the best possible principle
8914307 we were disappointed not to find a smoking gun that would explain the common association between obesity and asthma
8914308 however this research points us to other possibilities that future research should examine
8914309 to our knowledge this is the first report of a direct association between childhood abuse and asthma and asthma related outcomes
8914310 indian people are dying across this country from inadequate health care
8914311 it seems as though they believe a certain number of native american people are expendable
8914312 the large and growing unmet need for pediatric hiv aids services demonstrates that failure of our pmtct programs to avert parent to child transmission of hiv
8914313 if we prevent hiv infection in children then we do not need to take care of them when they are infected
8914314 cultural beliefs social stigma ignorance and economic status influenced the mothers attitudes and preference for the different feeding alternatives
8914315 deny their spouses the opportunity to participate in the program
8914316 we have a moral obligation to ensure that our children and grandchildren are born and remain free from hiv aids
8914317 developed in 1921 and fails to protect most people beyond childhood
8914318 essential to harness the most promising technologies so we can deliver an effective tb vaccine as quickly as possible
8914319 to understand why marginalized populations are at higher risk of infection you have to recognize that these groups often do not have equal access to housing education health care clean drinking water or nutrition
8914320 marginalized groups also face discrimination and have less control of funding streams for health and social welfare purposes
8914321 enjoy rights and a quality of life much higher than do people in other nations
8914322 legal system acknowledges constitutional and civil rights but not human rights
8914323 void when it comes to advocating for the right to quality health care for everyone
8914324 without equal access to quality health care the epidemic will only continue to increase in much of the world
8914325 some societies are busy playing the blame game to avoid taking on their fair share of the systematic responsibility for infections the medical community aids service organizations and human service agencies around the world are in the trenches trying to save lives
8914326 we will never have enough resources to defeat this epidemic if we dont have the support of our communities
8914327 investigators have assumed that asthma is not a complication of pediatric hiv infection
8914328 it was not until the era of haart which restored the t cell levels that an increased incidence of asthma was noted

8914333 i can not do much for the boy but i can give brother benjamin a home with me and as he is a great reader he can instruct the boy by wise precept and a good example if the boy

8914338 really spoke to me as a woman and i think she spoke to a lot of people in that way
8914339 if i cant become a better player with aston villa im not going to develop anywhere
8914340 a lot has happened at this club since i was last here and im obviously delighted to be back i was so close a couple of years ago but now im back
8914341 weve got a new training ground and a lot of new faces on the staff and in the playing squad
8914342 this is a club on the way up and things have got better and better every season since i was last here its an exciting time to be here this is a great place to be now theres lots of young english talent
8914343 the top four are the top four and aston villa are getting better and better we should be challenging now and as we look to improve we will be challenging
8914344 were in the uefa cup this season and hopefully well do well in that the next step then is obviously the champions league thats what were working towards
8914345 martin oneill was a massive pull and i was ready to sign for him two years ago hes got a great record and hes a fantastic manager look at the job hes done wherever hes been
8914346 look at the squad hes built here there are players in the england squad and players pushing to be involved a lot of thats down to the manager
8914347 ive played 180 premier league games and been involved in europe as well im lucky enough that i started when i was 16 so ive got a lot of football under my belt
8914348 im obviously a lot more experienced than when i was last here but im still young and still learning this is a superb place to be with the players the manager and the coaching staff we have here
8914349 with the set up that we have here now if i cant become a better player with aston villa im not going to develop anywhere
8914350 how many teams will beat manchester united and chelsea this year
8914351 i dont think theyll lose more than three games each
8914352 without being a silly optimist how many points would you expect us to get from these opening three games
8914353 we took one point from them last season and that point was against manchester united when we got absolutely battered in the second half we played better against them this season and lost 1 0
8914354 it would be nice to get a point or three points up at everton but if youve got any brains how many points did people expect us to get from our first three games nine i dont think so unless youre an idiot
8914355 it will be a tough test everton are a strong side yakubus a great goalscorer i know all about him because i signed him for us originally
8914356 so sure as youre a living man that was him

8914364 the mill invented the concept of chicken in the basket
8914365 the pub was almost empty on bank holiday saturday evening
8914366 it really put the mill on the map for many young people at the time
8914367 a lot of young and not so young people thought it was a splendid idea and came for miles
8914368 i just dont feel the need to comment im sorry if that sounds rude
8914369 there isnt a woman in the world that doesnt have a friend or a partner whos actually experiencing some sort of violence against them so i think although domestic violence hasnt happened to me personally i certainly know women who are dealing with this struggle every day

8914373 voor de behandeling van de voorjaarsnota in stadskanaal hebben we als cda fractie het idee geopperd kijk ook eens of bellingwedde betrokken kan worden in de samenwerking met stadskanaal en vlagtwedde
8914374 hij vertelde me dat ze nog aan het nadenken waren
8914375 dat kan zoals we nu doen met vlagtwedde het hoeft geen grote gemeente stadskanaal te worden
8914376 this community is made up of 54 million americans and can significantly impact the popular vote and still most members of our community feel that they receive little attention from the presidential candidates and from the political system as a whole
8914377 our national research indicates that our unheard voice is eager to be heard on topics such as healthcare accessibility veterans issues and unemployment
8914378 we are thrilled to have an opportunity to serve more customers in the dallas fort worth area with a new store at shops of southlake

8914382 this certainly cannot come too soon for people in the later stages of dementia who have not enjoyed the same level of access to specialist support as those with other conditions such as cancer end of life care for people with dementia could be significantly improved if similar resources and expertise were made available
8914383 barack obama and i have an honest disagreement on the issue of abortion
8914384 but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him
8914385 and i believe that as president hell pursue the common good by seeking common ground rather than trying to divide us
8914386 there was a time when the democratic tent wasnt big enough to include pro life catholics
8914387 sen caseys speaking role is a clear signal that those days are over we are hopeful that tonights address will begin to heal the deep divisions that exist in our country and pave the way for common ground efforts to reduce abortion
8914388 five men in black robes dont know better than women whats best for their health care
8914389 the police are enforcing the laws of obstructing traffic yet they wont enforce the laws against the killing of children
8914390 the worth of souls is great in the site of god
8914391 wow it looks like you have a nice bag of common north american agate
8914392 well hes a good looking man but look at her wowza
8914393 many people believe god does know the future exhaustively if you are one of those people i am interested in your reaction to this argument
8914394 you can kiss me if you can reach me on one condition you only move half the distance that separates us at a time i e 20 ft 10 ft 5 ft etc
8914395 impossible there are an infinite number of halves i can never reach her
8914396 the infinite seems like a bunch of hooey to me designed to keep the people oppressed
8914397 does god knows what happens in the last moment of time
8914398 i dont know i try not to think about infinity
8914399 the logic that says god cannot know the biggest number also says that god cannot know the future exhaustively
8914400 as one who can see the infinite it is anything but a bunch of hooey
8914401 if you cannot see forever be thankful that you cant
8914402 remember that there is no past or future with god everything is before him he exists in the eternal now therefore if you asked him a question the answer is right there before him and you d amp c 130 7 what i am saying is that knowing the biggest number is irrelevant
8914403 i think that your argument about multiple universes is largely moot our theology holds that god is beginningless and endless
8914404 dye think that you could ever through all eternity find out the generation where gods began to be
8914405 now if the sand was to be counted that is actually a finite number so god knows it until more sand was created by weathering erosion transortation and deposition it is a process that creates more sand but god would know that number too because it leads to a finite amount of sand
8914406 about that atonement thing it turns out that i made a little miscalculation concerning mercy and justice
8914407 i have learned that man is nothing which thing i never had supposed
8914408 just as there is no largest integer there is no last moment
8914409 it is therefore the very essence of vanity for man to use his finite mortal mind to judge that gods glorified perfected and infinite mind is limited in any way
8914410 mortal man with his finite mind cannot know the biggest number that is clear but it is also clear that god is not mortal and his mind is not finite it is therefore the very essence of vanity for man to use his finite mortal mind to judge that gods glorified perfected and infinite mind is limited in any way
8914411 it is one of the hallmarks of human vanity that we assume because we cannot do something that god cannot do it either
8914412 all our fathers children everywhere to believe in christ to receive him as he is revealed by living prophets
8914413 gods character perfections and attributes are not discovered using human logic properly revealed and correct ideas of gods character perfections and attributes are ever worthy of our discussion and praise
8914414 god does not know the future because it does not yet exist
8914415 the lord says and all things are present with me for i know them all moses 1 6
8914416 in a revelation given to the prophet joseph smith the lord describes himself as the same which knoweth all things for all things are present before mine eyes d amp c 38 2
8914417 not only is jesus omniscience asserted but the reason for his foreknowledge is given he is not bound by time and thus all things are present before him each moment
8914418 if god does not know the future then his knowledge must always be changing as he learns what has taken place
8914419 i do not need to know every instance of x in order to know in a practical sense that 2 x x x
8914420 if god does not know the future then by this definition he must continually learn new truths
8914421 and when the gossamer veil called time is too much with us let us recall that ere long time will be no more time is measured only to man anyway see
8914422 and i have a work for thee moses my son and thou art in the similitude of mine only begotten and mine only begotten is and shall be the dsavior for he is full of egrace and truth but there is no god beside me and all things are present with me for i know them all
8914423 and truth is knowledge of things as they are and as they were and as they are to come
8914424 some of the arguments about the meaning of the word truth have not sunk in for me yet
8914425 i disagree that knowledge of the future is essentually mathematical 2 x x x because i dont believe in determinism
8914426 im wondering what you make of the end of verse 30 otherwise there is no existence
8914427 if you would like ill send a copy of paper that looks at various scriptures which state or imply that god does not have foreknowledge
8914428 much of the future falls into this category of things that do not yet exist
8914429 but the lord knoweth all things from the beginning wherefore he prepareth a way to accomplish all his works among the children of men for behold he hath all power unto the fulfilling of all his words and thus it is amen
8914430 he hath power unto the fulfilling of all his words
8914431 he foresees the future as a state which naturally and surely will be not as one which must be because he has arbitrarily willed that it shall be
8914432 penal substitution it is only when one reads the full text provided above of the lesson that it becomes more clear it is not
8914433 my reason for wanting to learn all i can about the atonement is partly selfish our salvation depends on believing in and accepting the atonement such acceptance requires a continual effort to understand it more fully
8914434 he suffered the penalty for our sins in addition to us suffering the very same penalty
8914435 he took upon himself the pains sicknesses temptations afflictions and infirmities of us all
8914436 we must pay a sufficient amount to earn the free gift
8914437 all of the old testament and book of mormon prophets and christians before christ was born were able to repent without christ first suffering what was new in gethsemane was that one having experienced the fullness of divinity joined his empathetic suffering with the compassionate suffering of one who had experienced the fullness of mortality and being human so he moves from imaginative suffering to the suffering of shared experience he moves from mere empathy to full compassion and thus opened up a way for a new kind of relationship of joint exaltation and deification
8914438 if i turn to christ but fail to endure then i need to again be justified and turn to christ
8914439 but unto that soul who sinneth shall the former sins return
8914440 remember after ye are reconciled unto god that it is only in and through the grace of god that ye are saved
8914441 because of thy faith in christ whom thou hast never before heard nor seen wherefore go to thy faith hath made thee whole
8914442 how many angels can dance on the head of a needle
8914443 my reason for wanting to learn all i can about the atonement is partly selfish our salvation depends on believing in and accepting the atonement
8914444 i cant believe you are wasting your time trying to understand
8914445 you are wrong because you do not agree with this authority
8914446 elder the answer to that question can be found in volume 7 of answers to gospel mysteries right after the article dealing with the geography of kolob
8914447 christ promises to forgive our sins on the condition that we accept him by exercising faith in him repenting receiving baptism by immersion and the laying on of hands for the gift of the holy ghost and striving faithfully to keep his commandments to the end of our lives through continuing repentance we may obtain forgiveness and be cleansed of our sins by the power of the holy ghost
8914448 yes but does the atonement work because of restitution substitution theory or is it more a case of traditional penal substitution thats at play here
8914449 this looks like a dress your mother my grandma would wear
8914450 youre a gorgeous woman that i cant live with out
8914451 i would marry you all over again you rock my world etc
8914452 this is her birthday this is our anniversary and mothers day whats your price to cover me for the next five years
8914453 honey so and so just told me how her husband gave her lingerie for whatever holiday we were talking about how lame that was and how its more like a gift for him dont you think thats more like a gift for him honey

8914455 the spirit knoweth all things nevertheless the son of god suffereth according to the flesh
8914456 gradually rolls back the otherwise inevitable consequence of the second law which is universal death
8914457 ok our scriptures clearly say that because jesus christ was resurrected we all will be resurrected too i honestly have no idea why that is the case if god can cause all of us to get new bodies then why did jesus specifically have to do be resurrected to make that possible if christ never came couldnt god have resurrected us all anyway if so then whats the connection if not then what is the law that would prevent god from doing so
8914458 arguably one does not need the light of christ either
8914459 and in the garden of eden gave i unto man his agency
8914460 man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other
8914461 it must needs be that the devil should tempt the children of men or they could not be agents unto themselves
8914462 and it is given unto them to know good from evil wherefore they are agents unto themselves
8914463 in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin
8914464 arguably one does not need the light of christ either

8914468 we really dont know what exactly it is we are depending on the finding of a team of specialists from new delhi
8914469 a lot of people can still be saved we need doctors
8914470 everyone here is waiting for doctors to come and examine people but they arent coming and we are counting our dead
8914471 i have borrowed money from my relatives if they remain here they will die
8914472 we are in the process of talking to the government theyve not indicated one way or the other how theyre dealing with us
8914473 we always worry a little bit but we think our arguments are pretty strong
8914474 sixty is the new 50 as people live longer and the desire for independence and change is perhaps greater there may be a need to cash in at that point rather than become a carer
8914475 people have to spend more time together and the differences that are not apparent when one or both spouses are working are much more apparent when they are retired and forced to spend more time together
8914476 there is often the one life argument at that stage that and the possibility of being able to live comfortably by themselves is pushing women to make the change
8914477 the fact that divorce settlements for women are at an all time high and the prospect of parting with a large amount of hard earned capital will be putting people off getting divorced
8914478 people in their 60s now have much higher expectations of quality of life than they had 20 yeas ago theyre looking forward to 20 or 30 years of active life
8914479 certainly theres also an empty nest thing where they think the kids have gone lets start again
8914480 its not necessarily a depressing statistic but the figures will hide some personal tragedies including the prospect of people wanting younger trophy wives
8914481 if we do start again like we did against bath then theyll be working harder in training
8914482 rather than a bit of keep ball fun to warm up it will be running and well see if that motivates them
8914483 its a long trip to bromley but it has to be done weve got another game on tuesday down at basingstoke
8914484 we know where we are situated in the country and there are going to be a lot of long trips so there are no excuses there
8914485 weve got what weve got and people might move on or we might just have a little bit of room in the budget for one more player but it would be a really tight push
8914486 there will be one or two coming down to training this week as they are now getting released from other clubs as the transfer deadlines are coming up
8914487 there will be one or two around and maybe this will give our lads a kick up the backside

8914531 the rate of bgp path updates goes up by a factor of 200 to 400
8914532 they simply dont because it takes work and to do sufficient filtering to prevent these kinds of attacks on a global scale is cost prohibitive
8914533 that means that nobody could put themselves into the chain into the path unless they had been authorized to do so by the preceding as router in the path
8914534 we havent seen the attacks and so a lot of times people dont start working on things and trying to fix them until they get attacked

8914564 were travelling from edinburgh to ottawa via new york it was around 1 000 for the flights plus we had to pay for a night in a hotel
8914565 we tried to get a flight until 11pm last night then realised wed have to come back this morning
8914566 the other airlines are quoting 2 500 and we just cant do it
8914567 well have to cancel our trip but the canadians need to get home they are just going to have to pay out
8914568 we appreciate that airlines go bust but what i object to is that the authorities at the airport made no attempt to communicate with passengers

8914570 we were here for 7am yesterday and were told at 5 30pm that zoom had gone under

8914573 it seems that weve been left with no help from anybody
8914574 its a desperate situation it was to be a holiday of a lifetime
8914575 we would remind passengers intending due to travel with zoom airlines in the coming days that all of the airlines flights have now been cancelled
8914576 anyone planning to fly from glasgow with zoom should not travel to the airport unless they have made alternative travel arrangements

8914648 i was caught up in the heat of the moment got excited a little bit and they took offense to it
8914649 a couple of words were said back and forth but im not going to be intimidated by anybody
8914650 i may have looked over there but i didnt look at anybody in particular
8914651 we had some tempers flare and it probably helped us it probably woke us up a little bit

8914690 hed be outstanding at parkhead ibrox and tynecastle but we were losing other matches and i told him he had to perform the same way in them
8914691 i left him out whether he liked it or not
8914692 he took everything on board though and cant be doing too badly because he got himself into the jamaican national squad in the summer

8914733 ainda n o temos dados suficientes sobre a rela o da mudan a clim tica com o aumento das chuvas e dos extremos de precipita o acima de 20 mil metros
8914734 tamb m h necessidade de mais estudos para entender o aumento das descargas el tricas que em s o paulo por exemplo passaram de uma m dia de 6 mil no fim dos anos 1950 para 10 mil hoje o que representa um aumento de 30 a cada grau a mais na temperatura
8914735 h muitos desafios como entender as causas das mudan as clim ticas e conhecer melhor os ciclos biogeoqu micos e biogeof sicos precisamos de modelos clim ticos regionais com desenvolvimento de softwares brasileiros vamos ter que estudar tamb m como mitigar as emiss es quais s o as principais vulnerabilidades s mudan as clim ticas e como aumentar a capacidade adaptativa

8914740 quando olhamos os resultados de 20 modelos diferentes usados para tra ar cen rios clim ticos todos de alta robustez publicados em revistas indexadas vemos que h variabilidade em um fator de 30 vezes isso evidencia que nosso grau de desconhecimento sobre componentes cr ticos para as mudan as clim ticas muito grande
8914741 temos a um campo de pesquisa promissor o desmatamento por exemplo pode aumentar ou diminuir a precipita o dependendo da escala preciso entender esses processos

8914749 recalls can take time and the commission felt that time was of the essence and that warning the public about this product was so important that we could not wait until a recall was announced
8914750 we are working with the supplier and cpsc and are directing store managers to remove product identified in the cpsc press release from store shelves and initiating a register block to prevent sale
8914751 in addition we are in the process of removing this product from sale at walmart com
8914752 it is now clear what the foreseeable danger with this product is
8914753 the fact that we have put out this warning pretty much has determined that this is a product that should not be used by consumers
8914754 has refused to cooperate with the government and recall the products sfca maintains that it is not responsible for products previously manufactured by simplicity inc
8914755 all bassinets produced and sold by sfca are produced in this manner with fabric permanently attached over the lower bar and meet or exceed astm standards and cpsc guidelines
8914756 its rather obvious when you look at this bassinet that its defective and dangerous
8914757 the problem is that people dont think in those terms when you go to wal mart and find something covered with walt disneys winnie the pooh you dont think like that
8914758 trials of this nature are a hugely exciting prospect for uk ports of entry border control is an issue close to everyones heart and the ability to combine speed and throughput of passengers with the highest integrity of border control will change the travel experience as we know it this really is a ground breaking trial
8914759 identity matters and increased electronic integration within automated control systems like the simple use of an electronic passport checked at an automated clearance gate depends highly on the speed of interaction with the passenger while providing an efficient tool to cope with the increasing throughput of travellers maintaining the existing high security levels at the border
8914760 the fact is that u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities
8914761 it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their supervisors
8914762 therefore they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their supervisors
8914763 i think that those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defence officials who said that they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8914764 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8914765 i dont think there is anything to announce yet but i know that that is under discussion
8914766 certainly there is potential there because physically the russian navy is operating in the black sea so is the united states navy and so are other navies quite frankly that live in that part of the world
8914767 some of them were decapitated some did not have a hand each body was photographed

8914772 i couldnt make it out at first it wasnt until the wind blew that you could really see it is in a harness
8914773 there are goggles and it appears to be caught up in cables so presumably it is an airman
8914774 we are aware of the reports and we are looking at what can be done to identify the remains and establish whether they are of an australian and if they date back to the second world war
8914775 its too early to speculate on the nationality of the airman or the circumstances of his death there were allied australian and american and japanese airmen who would have been flying over the area in the war
8914776 a number of allied aircraft had been reported as missing in the area in particular b 25 mitchells and a number of kitty hawk aircraft

8914826 when they picked up from amscot on the thirtieth of june there was no odor but what about the odor you said you smelled to the 911 operator that was 15 days later i found rotten whatever it was something decomposing in there maybe someone put a body in the car after it went to the tow yard why dont you call them about their security

8914829 you know i feel that mr padilla came here and he gave me his word and until he tells me otherwise im going to hold him to his word that he wasnt going to come down here get his 15 minutes of fame and then throw her back in jail
8914830 make sure they look over that information with the state attorneys office and make a determination on the information were receiving again we still continue to look for caylee and try to locate her
8914831 were holding onto that miracle but we also know after this much time goes by the ending is affected
8914832 so were just coming in open minded and see if some of our resources may help
8914833 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8914834 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon

8914851 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time america this is one of those moments
8914852 i believe that as hard as it will be the change we need is coming
8914853 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8914854 he said that our economy has made great progress under this president
8914855 i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring
8914856 what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8914857 fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8914858 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain sen obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8914859 finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan
8914860 america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future
8914861 he did everything he needed to do he gracefully dissected john mccain and then set out his own vision and clearly everyone got it
8914862 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
8914863 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8914864 should we get another storm with any kind of quantity of water what we saw last week could be childs play
8914865 if we had to close the hospital and move 150 patients it would have been a very serious situation

8914871 aqu en nuevo le n han tenido la desgracia de contar con gobernadores salinistas adem s aunque muy rateros sean del pan o del pri el caso de natividad y el que estuvo anteriormente no recordaba el nombre de eso nos encargamos nosotros acaso se refiere a fernando elizondo
8914872 se elizondo fue el que aprob todos los acuerdos para comprar el gas en el extranjero y por eso los mexicanos pagamos m s por el gas que en otras partes del mundo
8914873 fernando elizondo gonz lez par s y salinas de gortari es lo mismo
8914874 el fue quien alent la privatizaci n del gas siendo l secretario de energ a fue el que firm contratos no s lo para entregar todo lo que es la zona de nuevo le n lo que es burgos para la explotaci n de gas
8914875 elizondo salinas calder n roberto hern ndez el empresario toda esta mafia bueno elba esther gordillo y todos los dem s son la mafia m s peligrosa

8914877 the legal union of only one man and one woman as husband and wife
8914878 it shows this is going to be an extremely close race
8914879 our people are very motivated our supporters understand the importance of the issue
8914880 this is a dead heat race and we havent started talking to people about how bad this is
8914881 its fairly long its fairly confusing and people arent really sure what it does then theres the question of whether it ever makes the ballot
8914882 i just dont know why either side would agree to it
8914883 what value would immunity be when they are dealing with someone who is probably a liar
8914884 specific conditions before we would allow the use of the limited use immunity
8914885 but i would be angling for the immunity that is broader
8914886 the events happened in new york and its a disadvantage to transfer everything here
8914887 any area employers that have their headquarters here and branches in other areas of the state couldnt use florida health care plans because we didnt have a strong network of out of area providers
8914888 this purchase brings more choice to the people of flagler and volusia counties
8914889 it will strengthen florida health care plans it adds to bluecross blueshield i think its going to be good for all constituencies
8914890 you wont see anything different tomorrow than you do today
8914891 the relationship we have with halifax is an extremely strong relationship among the strongest in the state
8914892 id say of all insurance plans in the area bluecross is probably the easiest
8914893 the farmers almanac is predicting a colder than normal winter and more snow
8914894 so i have people who not only want to save money on their heat bill but they want to stay warm
8914895 we ordered ten semi loads and weve already sold seven and its august
8914896 were thinking probably by the middle of september well be all sold out of the wood pellets we have coming
8914897 and you can insulate it and you can put in big windows but its still a big old house on the prairie and it takes a lot to heat it
8914898 if prices stay the way they are the payback is three years
8914899 if the prices drop significantly five to six years and thats not bad
8914900 weve actually had dealers that have sold as many furnaces in the first half of the year as they sold all last year and the normal heating season busy time is really just barely starting
8914901 they are doing their normal marketing things and the fuel prices have really sped up the decision process for people
8914902 theyre not waiting as long because they are concerned they may not be able to get a wood furnace if they wait too long because the demand is so high
8914903 weve actually since probably late march weve been having a lot of inquires for firewood and i would say our business is up as much as 20 percent this year
8914904 i dont know the effects it has on the environment id have to learn more about it
8914905 that fuel can be stored for a very long time safely
8914906 it operates 24 hours a day seven days a week its the best most reliable form of emissions free generation that we have available
8914907 the fuel a ceramic and its encased in stainless steel
8914908 its a completely dry environment surrounded by inert gas helium inside a metal cask so theres not really any active aging mechanisms so that fuel and being stored in those types of containers can be stored for a very long time safely
8914909 we should have lots of nuclear because wind is not very good its subsidized by the government
8914910 nuclear is clean takes up less acreage its a better deal
8914911 the problem with nuclear is you end up with the spent fuel cells and nobody wants that in their backyard
8914912 weve got this wonderful power source hanging in the sky that shines every single day it doesnt make much sense not to use it
8914913 joyful in hope patient in affliction and faithful in prayer
8914914 right now nearly 4 000 centrifuges are operating at natanz enrichment plant
8914915 what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me

8914921 kellyb send your kid to rutgers because their teachers are probably real profs not adjunct
8914922 this one is 60 meters which is just under 200 feet tall
8914923 things will come to a screeching halt if they dont extend the production tax credit
8914924 you have to forge ahead you have to continue to work the projects on a daily basis
8914925 there are too many intricate complex components that have to be completed on timetables and milestones and if those milestones dont get completed and dont get met those projects will never come to fruition
8914926 that means that the wind marketplace right now is going crazy
8914927 its driving the cost of wind turbines through the roof it means that a lot of developers are working day and night trying to get their projects finished so that they can meet that production tax credit deadline
8914928 without the production tax credit were going to see that it will be more difficult for us to be able to bring more wind onto the system because our customers will have to pay more for it
8914929 now we can still do it of course but it will just mean that the price of power will go up
8914930 it will generate about 525 000 in cash back to those local shareholders on an annual basis

8914940 the charity foundation has done a tremendous amount of work in terms of giving kit to children in countries around the world and as a club we are delighted to be sending this kit to a school which has got such close links to our local community here
8914941 by all accounts the children at milonde love their football and im sure will be delighted with these gifts from rangers
8914942 the pupils at govan high have formed a very close bond with the school and there is a growing link between hills trust primary and the local primary in milonde as well this gesture underlines those links

8914949 the captured israelis papers all written in hebrew when translated by the russian gru turned out to be somewhat different in nature
8914950 there is a building in zemonekozi a settlement to the south of tskhinvali that was fiercely defended by a georgian special operations squad upon clearing the building russian peacekeepers recovered among other documents an american passport in the name of michael lee white of texas
8914951 i do not know why he was there but it is a fact that he was in the building among georgian special forces troops
8914952 we have serious reasons to believe that american citizens were right at the heart of the military action
8914953 russian vessels will be visiting syria and other friendly ports more frequently the visits are continuing
8914954 the two leaders gave their directions to advance ties in the economy trade and energy fields as well as military cooperation
8914955 it remains to be seen how much the russians would come through for syria
8914956 damascus also does not want to jeopardize its ongoing peace talks with israel
8914957 were mad as hell and we wont take it anymore
8914958 i know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk they claim that our insistence on something larger something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values and thats to be expected because if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare the voters if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from you make a big election about small things and you know what its worked before because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government when washington doesnt work all its promises seem empty if your hopes have been dashed again and again then its best to stop hoping and settle for what you already know i get it
8914959 papers are very important it puts limits on the new prime minister for example the weak point of israeli syrian negotiations are papers signed by former prime ministers that now must be abided during current negotiations

8914969 this is a put on remember that during the larry sanders show duchovny played himself having a homosexual crush on gary shandling this is someone very comfortable in his own skin and his own sexuality and both david and his wife are excellent comedians theyre just having fun with us imagine if he did indeed have a sexual addiction do you think hed share that with us im sure that he would prefer to go to rehab and claim it was for substance abuse instead no one goes into rehab for sexual addiction and issues a press release announcing it to the world taint done michael douglas once went into rehab for substance abuse and complained because some tabloids were declaring it was for sexual addiction his father said what are complaining for you should be proud theyre writing that sorry this whole thing smells its a put on

8914976 lead cheers no do they contribute to the success of the team in any remote fashion no rules are rules and they need to be followed by the students even the ones who think theyre special
8914977 i am very happy for the support i have got during my 10 years career and am elated to bow out as a champion and hope the rest of the athletes who will follow suit will get the support they need
8914978 it was hard for it to sink down in me that i had won having led the pack from the start it was hard to maintain the lead and i made sure i tipped before the rest of the fast pack could catch up with me

8914987 my uncle martin would agree that we cannot end poverty hunger or suffering by killing those who might suffer
8914988 we cannot claim to guarantee equal rights if we deny the rights of the helpless and we cannot feign ignorance of the fact that those who are torn apart crushed or left to die on an abortionists table are just as human as we are

8915052 theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as
8915053 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 and made clear that we must take out and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
8915054 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell
8915055 but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8915056 dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8915057 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are here to restore that legacy
8915058 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8915059 thats not the judgment we need that wont keep america safe we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
8915060 promises to appoint more antonin scalias and clarence thomases and end a womans right to choose
8915061 i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8915062 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheny white house and promising to actually continue them hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8915063 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
8915064 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family

8915069 he has become the most trusted person in that county
8915070 hes a very warm and friendly and good humored man a college dropout whos probably the best read person in logan county
8915071 hes a reporters reporter and a guy who can talk to anybody
8915072 local radio is now doing a lot better financially than big city radio
8915073 they may not be happy that you reported their son got in trouble or their husband got in trouble but they will cut you slack if they think youve been fair and you treat everybody the same
8915074 the people we talk about are people we see at church and in line at the grocery store and at the coffee shop
8915075 i dont think ive done a whole show on greek drama but ive probably done everything else
8915076 its so local and so community oriented and everybodys got a voice
8915077 anybody who wants to come on the air well put them on if theyve got a charity or theyre promoting the united way or something going on with the schools
8915078 im not smart enough to know what other stations ought to do
8915079 but this one and me weve sort of evolved together and it works really well for us and our people
8915080 to live is like to love all reason is against it and all healthy instinct is for it

8915086 i had to rate and run cause dinner was ready sorry about that i like to think that when my great great great grandchildren are learning history the words of politicians will be put aside in favor of the words of people like dr king excellent post sally
8915087 look your old man had a full head of hair right up until you started showing up
8915088 today im only going to take ten from you since we gave you a buzz cut
8915089 the adverse impact of the continued violence and intimidation of the work force of the nano plant is not restricted to singur or west bengal but will resonate in indias global image
8915090 the process of development and growth being held ransom for short sighted political mileage is unwarranted and cannot be dismissed as a problem of a particular state
8915091 i will donate my one month salary as well rs 1 crores that i got from a tv show
8915092 prasad told reporters here on friday a day ahead of his visit to the flood hit areas besides all psus under railways will contribute to the fund which will be distributed among the flood victims after the rescue work is over and people come back to villages
8915093 the talks between indias home secretary madhukar gupta and our home secretary abdul karim are expected to be dominated by security and other cross border issues which concern both the neighbours
8915094 a political will is needed to further strengthen the police force including giving them more legal powers and resources
8915095 i requested the prime minister to immediately pass gujarats law against organised crime which has been passed twice by the assembly and has been lying with the centre for the past four years
8915096 it is important to understand that this law exists in maharashtra and if a bomb blast takes place they can use it but if it happens in gujarat just 50 km away i dont have the law
8915097 i want to tell those politicians who have their minds filled with vote bank politics that there were terrorist activities even when pota was in force and that despite having section 302 of ipc which gives death penalty for murder murders do take place does this mean we remove this clause
8915098 if the state orissa fails to restore normalcy within 24 hours the centre should impose presidents rule
8915099 there seems to be a systematic attempt to polarise the country on religious lines
8915100 we had no sleep for the past one week and absolutely no food since day before yesterday whatever food we had fled with is finished and now death stares us in the face
8915101 the meeting has again been deferredon friday in view of the illness of chairman of the governors panel and adviser s s bloeria
8915102 in entertainment games are the equal of the film and television industry and growth is strong but now the japanese game industry isnt leading with the same vigor that it did previously this is a worldwide battle
8915103 to either be affiliated and losing the brand or possibly merging with taito thats the big difference
8915104 while it looks like the games are made by a single talented genius games are made by teams
8915105 i dont know anything of the concrete details of this particular case
8915106 we do not condone any gelek gelek gyrating movements on stage
8915107 we are currently formulating a comprehensive guideline for concerts until then concerts of such nature are banned
8915108 we just do not want to allow the type of entertainment that could negatively influence people
8915109 the degree of criminality is not only causing the death of a former prime minister of a nation but also one of causing grave social unrest shock and turmoil in the psyche of each and every indian
8915110 the authorities rightly have kept these matters in mind while arriving at a decision of not permitting premature release of the petitioner
8915111 rice production will surely touch record this year on the back of the areas sown and the overall crop condition as of now even though floods in some producing regions have hit the crop
8915112 politicians should change their attitude towards sports by ensuring their sincere participation in the promotion of games in the country
8915113 in us politicians not only take keen interest in sports but also keeps any eye on each and every sports by ensuring their presence in the grounds
8915114 people have started taking interest in sports in the country and if the trend continues then we will win more medals in london olympics
8915115 theres no question were going to need to do something

8915124 tonight i say to the people of america to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8915125 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8915126 now i dont believe that sen mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is that youre on your own out of work tough luck youre on your own no health care the market will fix it youre on your own born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots you are on your own
8915127 we must also admit that programs alone cant replace parents that government cant turn off the television and make a child do her homework that fathers must take more responsibility to provide love and guidance to their children
8915128 we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than they are for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination you know passions may fly on immigration but i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers but this too is part of americas promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort i know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk they claim that our insistence on something larger something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values and thats to be expected because if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare voters if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from you make a big election about small things and you know what its worked before because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government when washington doesnt work all its promises seem empty if your hopes have been dashed again and again then its best to stop hoping and settle for what you already know i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you its about you

8915139 you put yourself on such a platform and everybody is trying to pull it from underneath you
8915140 every year is tougher and tougher because we set ourselves standards that we always try to better and the competition is getting tougher
8915141 wed like to win every trophy and be a part of every big game but i think it will happen less and less in the future
8915142 we will just take it with open arms at the minute and enjoy every appearance that we do make in major finals
8915143 i was a kid in 96 and obviously very nervous
8915144 now as one of the senior players im trying to calm a few nerves of the younger kids
8915145 they are massive occasions were lucky to play a sport as a living and do something we really enjoy and these are the pinnacles the games you get remembered for
8915146 when we got hull in the semi finals we saw it as the easier draw for us
8915147 take nothing away from hull because i think whoever had played them that day would have been on the losing side they were outstanding
8915148 confidence is high but you cant take anything for granted especially in big finals
8915149 this game is completely different its almost like the start of super league again and its whoever plays best on the day that will win the game
8915150 saints hull games are not usually high scoring games we won by one point at saints earlier in the year and only won by eight points at their place in a very close game
8915151 i imagine it will be very close again because they are not going to play how they have been playing in the league
8915152 im just really pleased we can finish the season on a bit of a high after reaching the cup final
8915153 if we can get that result it will probably put the disastrous league form well and truly behind us
8915154 finishing second from bottom is not where we expected to finish at the beginning of the season we were looking to push the top four and it has not turned out that way
8915155 when we came in at half time we had a good lead and we threw it away in the second half
8915156 after that game was probably as low as i have felt in my career
8915157 i was sort of kicking myself and the team were kicking themselves but the cup run has salvaged a bit of pride for ourselves so hopefully we can make the most of that
8915158 speaking to pete and seeing him the last few weeks when he had the job he was pretty run down
8915159 he lost a lot of weight and you could physically see that he was under a lot of stress
8915160 richard was due a step up hes been assistant now for several years and done a great job and hes continuing that with the first team
8915161 richard came in and told us to relax a little bit there is no pressure on you there is no relegation
8915162 but i dont think they will need much firing this weekend if you need firing for a challenge cup final you are in the wrong trade i think
8915163 we are just going to enjoy it as much as we can relax as much as we can i am certainly going to go and enjoy it and ill enjoy the day a lot more if we get the result
8915164 rightly we are underdogs but we will take that with both hands people can write us off as much as they want but lets hope we can upset the applecart
8915165 youve got to be on your game from 1 to 17 cup finals are about taking opportunities whenever one arises you have got to make sure you take it
8915166 i have been fortunate enough to win a challenge cup final and a grand final as well
8915167 this is a bit extra special because it is my home town club and all my family are going to go down and watch me
8915168 at bradford we had a special club at the time and it was civic reception after civic reception year after year with all the cup finals and grand finals
8915169 again hes a lefty comes to the net a lot plays aggressive
8915170 he won really quickly hes a tough guy to play against just again like roger federer he doesnt give you too much rhythm
8915171 but i feel like im playing well just now im confident and i look forward to the match
8915172 the tough thing is when i won that third set and then im up 30 0 on my serve
8915173 and the most pleasing thing for me was each time i got broken in the fourth set was that i came back straight away
8915174 i thought that the whole match was tough mentally and i dealt with it well
8915175 i didnt let any of it linger on too long
8915176 i said what had to be said i felt if there are calls like that and its one of the biggest tournaments in the world its not nice to have that sort of lack of confidence in a line judge or an umpire
8915177 you want to just be able to go and play and i think for a little bit of the match neither of us felt that comfortable with the calling so thats what makes it difficult

8915179 when forced to choose to wager your life for the existance of god the one true god presumably the god of abraham is the most reasonable choice based on the following principles if you do believe and you are right you are granted eternal life and a place at his side if you do believe and you are wrong you are as well off as any non believer if you do not believe and you are right you are you no better off than any believer if you do not believe and you are wrong you are condemned to eternal hellfire we can then surmise that those who believe have everything to gain and nothing to lose while the inverse is true for any who believe not and that the safer gamble is that of existance
8915180 when forced to choose to wager your life for the existance of all gods is the most reasonable choice based on the following principles if you do believe and you are right about one of them you are granted eternal life and a place at someones side if you do believe and you are wrong about all of them you are as well off as any non believer if you do not believe any of them and you are right about all of them you are you no better off than any believer if you do not believe any of them and you are wrong about even one of them you are condemned to eternal hellfire we can then surmise that those who believe in all religions have everything to gain and nothing to lose while the inverse is true for any who believe not in all religions and that the safer gamble is that of the existance of all gods
8915181 when forced to choose to wager your life for neither the existance nor non existance of any god is the most reasonable choice based on the following principles if you do believe and you are right you are granted eternal life and a place at his side if you do believe and you are wrong you have waisted the entirety of the only life you will get pursuing a lie if you do not believe and you are right you have lived a full life pursuing things you value more than your lack of a particular belief if you do not believe and you are wrong you are condemned to eternal hellfire we can then surmise that those who believe may have everything to gain and may have everything to lose while the same is true for any who believe not and that the safer gamble is that of neither the existance nor the non existance of any god as they may bear exactly the same qualitative results

8915230 ah coincidencialmente habl con los directores de todas las empresas de seguridad privada de colombia despu s de terminar mi intervenci n hubo una ronda de preguntas en la que seguramente particip este se or sierra
8915231 a ellos la polic a les debo mucha gratitud pues mi trabajo normal es en campo con las comunidades y para llegar hasta ellas entender su situaci n y buscar alternativas para ayudarlas he recorrido el pa s muchas veces exponiendo hasta mi vida
8915232 saquemos esa bandera blanca manejemos la situaci n con concordia y demos el ejemplo
8915233 muchas veces el silencio conduce a la impunidad pol tica y por eso el gobierno responde
8915234 es importante sacar la bandera blanca pero es m s importante conservar los principios para que mediante un di logo se pueda llegar a lo mejor para el pa s
8915235 las reacciones de la corte de la oposici n y del presidente uribe pueden generar una polarizaci n que no le cae bien al pa s
8915236 es bueno que el presidente invite a todo el mundo a un di logo a un consenso para que se puedan seguir buscando unas relaciones arm nicas entre las diferentes ramas del poder p blico
8915237 el llamado est muy bien pero antes de bajarle el tono a la discusi n lo que hay es que llamarle seriamente la atenci n al presidente sobre el incumplimiento de una obligaci n constitucional suya que consiste en que l debe respetar y hacer respetar los fallos de las cortes
8915238 in my mind its a statement of principles its not a recipe
8915239 i think if we talk to people and tell them this is a statement of principles of intent and during the implementation that theres leeway to discuss with canadians i think thats the logical way to do it
8915240 ive just agreed to write a movie for sony and producer scott rudin about how facebook was invented

8915247 anything that i am completely unused to discovering is marvellous it is a bonus i knew nothing about bongs really i found them terrifying therefore it allowed me to allow him to do something as he has never done it before
8915248 even though he is an addicted pot smoker he always takes a joint as he has never seen one before it might have been ten minutes since his last joint he never quite knows what to do with it
8915249 the opportunity to revisit it without the consequences is exciting

8915251 wir sprechen derzeit mit regierungsstellen sie haben weder so noch so angedeutet wie sie mit uns verfahren wollen

8915253 if it does work out well it will probably be a small plus for us
8915254 obviously if it doesnt work out well then the republicans are going to have a problem
8915255 its more of a problem if youre the guy living in the eye of the storm
8915256 our concern is for the lives in the storms potential path
8915257 what youre going to see is the product of three years of planning training and exercising at all levels of government starting with the local and the state level and leading up to the federal level so were clearly better prepared
8915258 if youve got an event the size of the olympics and youve got billions and billions of people watching it you definitely have a backing track and mime to it because anything could go wrong
8915259 its just a safety first thing you cannot take the risk
8915260 we share artists all the time and conductors all the time
8915261 it was all prerecorded and the mso melbourne symphony orchestra did record a minority of the music that was performed
8915262 its correct that we were basically miming to a pre recording
8915263 we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8915264 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8915265 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time
8915266 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
8915267 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8915268 he personalized his story he humanized his story but what he also did was he punched back at all the accusations and criticism that john mccain has been saying that he is a celebrity that he is elitist
8915269 he said look i come from humble beginnings i know people are hurting out there
8915270 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8915271 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8915272 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists that actually attacked us on 9 11
8915273 you know john mccain likes to say he will follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8915274 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8915275 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8915276 doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8915277 just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons before getting right back to work his greatest achievements songs future plans oh boy thats a hard one
8915278 i am still looking forward to doing a lot of great things
8915279 i love composing and the whole thing but i am also raising my children and enjoying it and teaching them to ride bicycles and how to read i love it
8915280 i let them go to the arcade and go to the movies and do things
8915281 i want them to get to do the kind of things i didnt get to do so i fill them with a lot of enjoyment that way a lot of amusement you know
8915282 i get pretty emotional when i see them having a wonderful time
8915283 when they are on a ride and they are screaming and they are happy it makes me emotional cause i see they are having a real good time
8915284 i dont need to know anything about you well get to know each other on the date come one pleeease i have money ill fix your car

8915290 now the new democratic network isnt calling for wage and price controls nor did the dlc in its heyday show any real interest in weaning the party from its dependence on labor and regulation libertarians with long memories may also shudder to remember clintons decidedly old school views on the fourth amendment the drug war and the death penalty and you cant blame the democrats for trying to cash in on president bushs mid 20 percent approval rating the democratic party these days is not in the hands of left leaning ideologues but left leaning utilitarians
8915291 although anticipation of a fall election has been heating up for the past week local candidates hoping to unseat incumbent conservative mp david sweet have effectively been campaigning for more than a year canadas top four parties appear poised for a snap election call in ancaster dundas flamborough and westdale locally the liberals conservatives new democrats and green party all have candidates in waiting if prime minister stephen harper calls a federal election as expected early next week
8915292 the office of the vice president has surely undergone a transformation in recent years from dan quayle to dick cheney is a long way to travel the role of the vp with cheney acting as the eminence grise of the bush regime and some would say the real president has been amplified to the nth degree and it looks like the administration of barack obama is going to continue this ominous tradition joe biden on the ticket with obama as we said on monday is a big victory for the war party which will not as a result be shut out of power if the democrats take the white house
8915293 it is often said that there is not a dimes worth of difference between the parties but there is little reflection on what precisely they have in common it comes down to a love of some version of dictatorship of which they believe they will be the administrators what is the alternative it is pure liberty a word that is used only as a slogan in public affairs these days by liberty i mean only one kind a life without badgering from the state there is nothing on gods green earth that the state can do better than we can as individuals and communities and voluntary associations what i mean by liberty is no more or less than firing the state as the administrator of society
8915294 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family

8915363 you know john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8915364 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
8915365 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8915366 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8915367 i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
8915368 the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag
8915369 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8915370 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8915371 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on behalf of them that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8915372 well i know something about close elections so let me offer you my opinion i believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8915373 next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8915374 and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8915375 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500
8915376 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work

8915378 but in norway and in saudi arabia authorities have instead focused on corralling the foreign exchange earned in the sales of energy and investing it outside their borders creating an income stream for future generations
8915379 i mean people have access to health care in america after all you just go to an emergency room
8915380 multiple criminal acts including bombings and attacks against iraqi targets
8915381 if its right that theyve arrested the man who was in charge i will sue him
8915382 this incident shows the need for an end to the random arrest of iraqis by the american forces which are against the human rights outlined in the constitution it proves for a fact that each iraqi might be arrested or put in prison without knowing the reasons
8915383 it is a message for the baathists to go on in their wrongdoings
8915384 this guy was doing his job perfectly hes served his country by all his efforts since 2003
8915385 they cant recreate the reagan coalition life has changed americas priorities are different
8915386 americans are still small c conservative that may be changing in regard to the republican party
8915387 there was a lot of lip service paid to ronald reagan by the candidates but when you get down to specifics they are tilting away from reagan toward some new mix
8915388 neocons are willing to throw out some of the principles of conservatism
8915389 christian conservatives are more demanding in tactics and goals than they were what theyve done is take conservatism from being a federalist approach with focus on liberty and make it a big government style of conservatism using the federal government to dictate what people do
8915390 its a very rare leader who can bring together disparate groups when they agree on 70 percent and disagree on 30 percent reagan was able to succeed at that bush has been much more typical more susceptible to these divisions
8915391 people now are looking for reasons to argue rather than reasons to cooperate
8915392 there are big elements still out there waiting for someone to unite them
8915393 even during the cold war during the harsh confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we always avoided direct clashes between our civilians even more so between our military personnel
8915394 ordinary experts even if they teach military affairs should not do so in combat zones but in training areas and training centers
8915395 what was the purpose of that gentleman being among the special forces and what is he doing today i so far cannot answer
8915396 i wish we had americans and american weapons but its not the case
8915397 they are living in a parallel world with a parallel perception if you say a lie in russia it becomes the truth the next day on tv
8915398 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8915399 performing official duties and they may only do this on orders from their supervisors not at their own initiative
8915400 if my conjecture is confirmed then it raises the suspicion that someone in the united states deliberately created this conflict in order to worsen the situation and create an advantage for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8915401 and if this is a fact it is nothing other than the use of so called administrative resources in a domestic political struggle and in the worst bloodiest form as well
8915402 and if you dont succeed its possible to shift the blame on us turn us into the enemy against the backdrop of rah rah patriotism to rally the country again around certain political forces i am surprised that you are surprised at what i say its obvious
8915403 of course it undermined our relationship the relationship between the nations above all
8915404 george responded to me i have already talked about this publicly that no one wants war
8915405 we had hoped that the u s administration would intervene in the conflict and stop the aggressive actions of the georgian leadership none of this happened
8915406 we are a peace loving nation but if someone believes they can come to kill us using our own land as a cemetery then these people should reflect on the implications of such policies
8915407 and starting monday all of my friends are going to appear on television

8915425 on land they are really vulnerable to predators and to being trampled by big males when a human or polar bear shows up they panic and stampede
8915426 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs

8915504 there have been numerous in vitro and in vivo trials on herbal medicine which have established the benefits of single ingredients such as gingko for vascular dementia
8915505 there is no convincing evidence that ginkgo biloba is efficacious for dementia and cognitive impairment
8915506 the evidence that ginkgo has predictable and clinically significant benefit for people with dementia or cognitive impairment is inconsistent and unconvincing
8915507 we found no evidence that a standard dose of high purity ginkgo biloba confers benefit in mild moderate dementia over six months
8915508 unlike mrsa there is no way of screening for c difficile so the most important thing to get right is cleanliness
8915509 patients staff and visitors can carry the bacteria into a hospital without knowing it or become infected in the community thats why handwashing is so important
8915510 we use chlorine based cleaners and have antimicrobial disposable curtains that we remove after an infected patient has been in a ward
8915511 it was so thorough that afterwards the wheels on the beds seized up they would not run properly because theyd been cleaned of oil
8915512 the most important thing when you suspect an infection is to isolate the patient quickly even before you get the test results back from the lab
8915513 if you give patients broad spectrum antibiotics designed to kill all bacteria they get rid of even the types that help keep c difficile at bay

8915521 thus not even a call but thats par for the course with dina she didnt even send a card or visit when he was sick
8915522 if he really cared about me and my life then he would learn to respect my wishes by staying out of it so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible

8915532 he did a great job addressing the areas where he has been attacked patriotism his qualifications for the job and how he plans to pay for all his ideas
8915533 the over the top stadium show surrounding the speech might help motivate his supporters but it might be playing into the hands of his critics who try to paint him as a rock star with no substance
8915534 he described a chance to keep the american promise and he made a lot of promises he is the pied piper of promises
8915535 a government that is powerful enough to give you everything you want can take everything you have
8915536 he is scarier than former president bill clinton because he is arrogant and a true believer
8915537 it was a feel good speech it made you think about yourself and where you wanted the united states to go it was just him making you feel good for the purpose of him getting elected
8915538 there was great resonance with his criticism of the bush administration and mccains support for it

8915548 if anything youre starting to see the necessity of why you have to get younger weve had some injuries theres no doubt about it but weve got some key guys who havent performed like theyre capable of is that because of age
8915549 obviously as weve seen this year you cant have enough pitching
8915550 ultimately what i feel is a strong reluctance to trade three or four assets to another team for a player and then sign him to a multiyear contract you trade for a guy give up three or four assets and then pay him then youve crushed your payroll and your assets at the same time
8915551 if you choose to play in that marketplace the one thing youd be sacrificing is a draft pick
8915552 were very protective of our draft picks but for the right player and the right circumstance ive always said were still big game hunters
8915553 certainly phil hughes has stubbed his toe with the injury
8915554 but when we held on to a guy like that you dont do it and say ok in the next four months hes got to do x hes got five years whatever it is to show why you bet on someone like that

8915768 a simple and low cost procedure has been developed to produce an array of agar ose microparticles that have a range of functionalities and could be of use in many areas throughout the food industry for example as or as micro encapsulation vehicles for functional ingredient protection and delivery
8915769 the small size of these particles means that they could be incorporated into a food product as a bulking agent and texture modifiers for a wide range of beverages

8915772 animal studies have indicated for years that msg might be associated with weight gain
8915773 ours is the first study to show a link between msg use and weight in humans
8915774 second human studies where msg was added to the diet have failed to show changes in body weight and third a recently published rat study suggests that msg in the diet actually suppresses body weight
8915775 we found that prevalence of overweight was significantly higher in msg users than in non users
8915776 we saw this risk even when we controlled for physical activity total calorie intake and other possible explanations for the difference in body mass the positive associations between msg intake and overweight were consistent with data from animal studies
8915777 in the he et al study the average bmi among non msg users versus the highest quartile of estimated msg use was 22 3 versus 23 5 given this small difference the imprecise methods by which msg intake was estimated and controlled human studies that directly conflict with the results of this report the glutamate association statement strongly questions the broad extrapolation made by the authors
8915778 numerous regulatory authorities and expert bodies including fao who fda health canada efsa and fsanz all have concluded that msg is safe for use as an ingredient in foods

8915788 im confident our players are pretty smart what happened a year ago and this is a different season this is a new team that has to find its own identity
8915789 this im proud its an honor to be here it feels good
8915790 i dont know it just happened i was trying to pitch good in triple a and thats all i can never never think of another place i cant think of the big leagues if im in triple a i have to do my stuff in triple a before i get here and now i have to do my stuff here

8915803 energy bars are familiar to many americans but other energized foods such as candy chips milk and cereal are definitely not we expect the concept of energy both physical and mental to greatly influence food product development
8915804 energy is poised to take food in a new direction giving consumers who need a boost many different ways to get it
8915805 from natural energizers like omega 3s or antioxidants to foods that are fortified with energizing ingredients we are seeing energy to emerge as a core benefit in new food products
8915806 this trend shows that consumers may be distinguishing between somewhat unhealthy stimulants which they desire and high sugar content in drinks which they do not
8915807 stimulants could be infused into many other foods breakfast foods may be a particularly good candidate including energy giving cereals breads and spreads
8915808 energy drinks have quickly become a daily beverage choice as more americans use energy drinks weve seen a rise in products being launched with innovative new ingredients claims and consumer targets

8915816 ach es ist ja schon seit einem guten halben jahr ein st ndiges auf und ab gewesen schon vor dem giro fing das an dass hans michael holczer regelm ig mit der neuigkeit kam einen interessenten an der angel zu haben jeweils zwei bis drei tage nach diesen nachrichten kam dann das dementi das ging allen an die nerven nicht nur dem management unseres rennstalls auch wir fahrer haben unter dieser situation gelitten
8915817 er macht hier gute miene zum b sen spiel im inneren ist er mit sicherheit total fertig vielleicht hat er das ganze drama aber auch noch nicht so richtig realisiert vielleicht kommt das erst wenn er bald irgendwo den schl ssel f r seinen bus abgeben muss
8915818 immer mal wieder haben wir geschichten geh rt holczer musste ja teilweise unseri sen angeboten nachgehen immer in der hoffnung sein lebenswerk zu erhalten wie er sich eingesetzt hat habe ich immer daran gemerkt dass ich noch tief nachts mails von ihm bekommen habe es muss aufreibend f r ihn gewesen sein
8915819 ich habe mit markus fothen nach der tour de france ber dieses thema gesprochen als wir ja beide nicht so die leistung gebracht haben wie wir uns das selbst erwartet hatten wir waren uns einig dass diese ungekl rte situation unsere leistung schon beeintr chtigt hat bei mir ist das so dass ich nur 100 prozent leistung bringen kann wenn es auch in meinem umfeld hundertprozentig stimmt und wenn ein paar prozent fehlen gewinne ich eben nichts
8915820 nein noch nicht ich muss jetzt gespr che aufnehmen aber ich habe schon gemerkt dass ich mit meinen 30 jahren in keiner so tollen position bin die teammanager warten erst einmal ab weil sie genau wissen dass momentan der preis in den keller geht cr dit agricole hat auch keinen neuen sponsor so stehen also 50 fahrer auf der stra e das ist konkurrenzkampf pur der den preis ins bodenlose dr ckt
8915821 nein ich m chte schon noch fahren es ist ja nun nicht so dass ich in den letzten jahren so viel verdient h tte dass ich schon ausgesorgt habe ich kann ja auch nicht so einfach wie jemand anderes zum arbeitsamt gehen ich bin angesichts dieser ganzen entwicklung schon m chtig bedient denn ich habe das gef hl dass ausgerechnet einige fahrer von gerolsteiner das ausbaden m ssen was andere uns eingebrockt haben
8915822 na wir waren in den letzten jahren sauber und sind permanent beschissen worden und jetzt macht ausgerechnet unser team zu und wir sind zum zweiten mal die beschissenen das ist schon frustrierend
8915823 hopefully the default behavior will change to explicit unbind in the future releases non sp of net framework
8915824 its about making easier and more secure the task of mobilizing a workforce
8915825 there is extreme interest in our customer in this from our largest accounts to small companies
8915826 you just need to look at the degree to which enterprises are considering are virtualization
8915827 spam was getting bigger and bigger and bigger every day
8915828 but it can go as high as 95 per cent sometimes
8915829 it can be a huge challenge for it managers when it comes to bandwidth resources
8915830 was the whole suite of requirements for content filtering customization they wanted different rules to apply to different user groups
8915831 that way you dont have to manage all that spam on an ongoing basis and relieve your staff to concentrate more on the core business its a huge waste of bandwidth and this way you dont have to upgrade your system or your bandwidth
8915832 spam is no longer a standalone problem i am very suspicious of vendors who only do spam but doesnt process web threats the two are so intimately linked today that it really doesnt make sense to consider them as standalone threats
8915833 i think it was very hypocritical for him to criticize mccain for running negative ads and then spending three fourths of his speech bashing him i think the american people would be very naive to buy into what he was saying
8915834 i just dont think hes got the experience to make those promises and deliver on them
8915835 ya allah tolong abaikan puasa ummat muhammad apabila sebelum memasuki bulan ramadhan dia tidak melakukan hal hal yang berikut
8915836 the future of the internet and how to stop it
8915837 a tragic illustration of religious fanaticism superstition and the abuse of power
8915838 are you sure they were free looks more like half off to me
8915839 i can only believe that our proposal will be accepted
8915840 the package is aimed at getting voters attention in anticipation of the next election
8915841 its definitely positive but to what extent is the question
8915842 weve been calling this a shallow recession and the data today tend to support that view
8915843 but that doesnt mean they point toward a quicker recovery either
8915844 going forward whether core measures of cpi excluding food and energy would show signs of inflation would be the key factor in determining the bank of japans actions
8915845 improved external demand for products of those industries in july seemed to be in the background of their industrial production gains
8915846 it is not a merger investigation and has no specific deadline
8915847 were in a time in our economy when the financial markets are tougher
8915848 given the economy its understandable that financially the pieces hadnt come together as wed hoped but now its a definite agreement
8915849 it will definitely benefit us over many years to come we need it without a doubt
8915850 whats noteworthy about paramounts summer is how few of its films were homegrown
8915851 will smith is by far the most reliable box office draw in the movies
8915852 it was really in the interests of pernod to have that control
8915853 doesnt seem to feel there is a great urgency to get into the vodka business in a big way
8915854 but who knows maybe they are talking to stoli right now
8915855 theres no question were going to need to do something
8915856 when you are part of a family that comes up with a concept sometimes youre the last to admit that it needs to be changed
8915857 thats just crazy maybe they should start calling it the 99 cents and up store
8915858 we try to keep our prices as low as possible
8915859 not based on having every single variety of every product out there
8915860 some relief on the 99 cent price point will provide more stability for their business
8915861 whats the point why not sell a standard size and price it accordingly
8915862 if i look at the situation in the second quarter we would have to say it was more self inflicted
8915863 whenever youre restarting growth what i can tell you is its an imprecise process there were some parts of the business where we were probably too aggressive
8915864 it is going to cost a lot of money to expand their business
8915865 when you look at their arsenal price is really their only weapon
8915866 im really mad about the way this thing is going
8915867 we are in the time period within the contract that gives us the opportunity of eliminating or alleviating the effects of the layoff why theyre going around scaring people is beyond me
8915868 its managements prerogative in terms of what they run as columns or what they dont run as columns but seniority must be honored as far as were concerned
8915869 it is our position that seniority prevails in order of layoff regardless of a column that a person writes or does not write are we going to fight over it i dont know
8915870 i looked at the newspaper this morning and went what the hell it was the most ludicrous thing ive seen in my life
8915871 youve been selling me out there for years and promoting me then you turn on me and you expect people to buy it its crazy
8915872 it looked amateurish this is like something the white sox would do
8915873 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8915874 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8915875 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8915876 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8915877 has taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
8915878 because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change
8915879 hes said many times that the primary battle was historic and exciting and that in the end result it would be good for the democratic party that it would energize a lot of people and bring a lot of new people out
8915880 he expected all along that this would resolve itself elegantly and organically and it did
8915881 i think hes very happy with where we are we have a nominee a spectacular nominee and hes going to do everything he can to see him elected
8915882 we think gore can deliver a compelling message on both the economy and foreign policy as relates to energy
8915883 hes a messenger there are a lot of elected officials that voters dont readily accept information from and hes one that they do they think that hes got credibility he has some credibility because a lot of voters believe that if he were elected the last eight years would have been different
8915884 what he has said is that he is not interested in serving in a future administration but that he hasnt ruled out public office and that if he ran for office again it would probably be for president
8915885 he has found a very unique role and platform as a kind of public private citizen able to harness resources creatively to make a huge impact on the climate crisis
8915886 since track forecasts are always subject to large errors at three to five days it is simply impossible at this time to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall
8915887 it would be no surprise if rapid intensification occurred and gustav became a category 4 or 5 hurricane by 72 hours
8915888 i think everyones definitely more aware and not trying to wait until the last minute trying to be ahead of the game a little bit
8915889 has offended the religious feelings of many people who consider the cross a symbol of gods love and of our redemption
8915890 pokes fun at the catholic population and offends religion and the pope
8915891 with humor and a tragicomic sense which belongs to art since the times of greek tragedy kippenberger faces his condition of suffering which he expresses in many works also for example in a video in which he crucifies himself
8915892 art must always be free and the artist should not have any restrictions on freedom of expression

8915900 reafirma seu esp rito de coopera o com o g8 os sete pa ses mais desenvolvidos do mundo e a r ssia e est aberta para uma troca de opini es franca e sobre todos os problemas da atualidade
8915901 la propuesta es la m s conveniente para el pa s en el momento de crisis que atraviesan en este momento las relaciones entre las instancias del poder
8915902 desde el partido hay toda la disposici n de sacar la bandera blanca eso es lo que m s le conviene al pa s y a las instituciones siempre y cuando haya colaboraci n arm nica por parte de las mismas claro est siempre con la verdad por delante legitimando la justicia y con independencia
8915903 me parece muy loable la actitud del se or vicepresidente de la rep blica aqu lo que debe haber es un entendimiento una armon a dentro del respeto que se debe tener del acatamiento a las decisiones judiciales
8915904 el partido ve con gran preocupaci n la pugna que se apoder del pa s a ra z de algunas acciones por parte de la oposici n por eso nos parece que la invitaci n del vicepresidente santos es un llamado oportuno no s lo para el presidente uribe sino para todos los frentes incluyendo la oposici n que se opongan sin amarguras y sin resentimientos para volver a los cauces de la institucionalidad y de armon a entre los poderes
8915905 que saquemos esa bandera blanca manejemos la situaci n con concordia y demos el ejemplo del 80 por ciento de colombianos que nos respaldan
8915906 yo estoy de acuerdo con santos en el sentido en que hay que bajarle el tono a la controversia pues esta es muy til en un sistema democr tico pero en t rminos mesurados
8915907 el presidente no puede faltar a las reglas del estado de derecho desligitimando a las cortes su obligaci n es acatar los fallos y no deslegitimar a trav s de los medios
8915908 este gobierno responde por cada uno de sus hechos el silencio lleva a la impunidad pol tica
8915909 es un llamado positivo pero el asunto de fondo es el respeto que debe tener el presidente lvaro uribe a la separaci n de poderes y a la autonom a del poder legislativo y del poder judicial
8915910 el prop sito del vicepresidente es muy loable aunque soy esc ptico sobre ese llamado
8915911 pienso que la raz n para que el presidente pueda estar reaccionando de manera airada es que se debe sentir muy solo claro est que en lugar de echar le a al fuego su papel es el de sacar las mangueras

8915924 the bible calls debt a curse and children a blessing but in our culture we apply for a curse and reject blessings something is wrong with this picture
8915925 the team at ciao has built a passionate consumer community based on intuitive technology and extensive merchant relationships that we believe will deliver incremental benefit to the microsoft live search platform
8915926 theyre starting to talk about demand destruction in western europe and in asia
8915927 up until this point the large tech companies like the ibms of the world have done pretty well in holding up their earnings because theyve had strong and consistent international demand
8915928 this shows international economies are slowing down and dell cited that specifically
8915929 it is conservatism that has been relatively consistent for the last six months or so but it is somewhat spreading
8915930 no soy actor ni pretendo serlo porque le tengo un gran respeto a la profesi n sin embargo siempre he tenido cierta atracci n por la actuaci n as que cuando me lleg el proyecto no dud en aceptarlo no interfer a con mi gira
8915931 el mensaje de la serie es muy claro se habla de la muerte pero no con pesimismo sino que simplemente se muestra el lado humano de esos pacientes y se le da valor a lo que es vivir y disfrutar cada momento que se tiene
8915932 lo que nos queda pendiente es la licencia ambiental que esperamos obtener en septiembre para cumplir con todos los requisitos del proyecto
8915933 la medida establece que la hidroel ctrica pescadero ituango propietaria del proyecto con el fin de evitar restricciones innecesarias a la propiedad privada deber liberar en el menor tiempo posible y ante las respectivas oficinas de registro de instrumentos p blicos las reas de terreno que no se requieran para la construcci n del proyecto de generaci n
8915934 la idea con esta dotaci n es mejorar la movilidad de la fuerza p blica en la consolidaci n de la seguridad democr tica en el departamento
8915935 antioquia es un ejemplo para el pa s en apoyo a los temas de seguridad esta es una demostraci n de un compromiso total de la gobernaci n con nosotros como instituci n y esto estimula a los miembros de la polic a a realizar su mejor trabajo
8915936 faltando diez para las seis de la ma ana contact al general g mez m ndez le dije lo que yo conoc a que hab a una referencia de sierra hablando con valencia donde lo mencionaban diciendo que sierra hab a hablado con l le ped una explicaci n clara del d a la hora y las circunstancias y el motivo que tuvo para hablar con el empresario antioque o
8915937 para que l ante el ente acusador ofrezca las explicaciones que den cuenta de las circunstancias de tiempo modo y lugar en que se produjo esa comunicaci n que dice haber tenido sierra
8915938 si hay alguna situaci n que est afectando la polic a es justamente que el se or valencia haya usado informaci n privilegiada de la polic a para transmitirla a esos hampones
8915939 el presidente generaliz al decir que la fiscal a en medell n es una verg enza eso nos ha tra do problemas para adelantar los procesos porque la ciudadan a est desconfiando con esas palabras se ha tendido un manto de duda sobre toda la fiscal a

8915946 humanitarian aid first of all we will want the european unions full engagement which will go beyond the routine activities of the european commissions humanitarian aid office so additional funds will be needed
8915947 secondly there is a need for the european unions effort in the reconstruction of georgia especially the georgian state infrastructure destroyed during the war
8915948 this includes elements of infrastructure so important from the point of view of energy strategy like pipelines railways bridges port infrastructure or airports
8915949 we should move towards calling an international peacekeeping force under the banner of the european union
8915950 we are still in a phase of dialogue with moscow not in a phase of sanctions
8915951 that the six point deal must be applied in its entirety
8915952 we hope that reason will prevail over emotions and that eu leaders will find the strength to reject a one sided assessment of the conflict and give an independent objective and detailed assessment of the situation and what caused it
8915953 se confirma plenamente lo que hab amos informado est claro que si la autoridad monetaria quer a desacelerar la econom a ya lo logr en efecto tuvimos un primer semestre bastante flojo de aqu en adelante tenemos que construir un contexto que permita r pidamente retomar la senda de alto crecimiento y de manera r pida
8915954 vamos a tener un a o con un crecimiento apenas aceptable veo la agricultura y las obras p blicas con buenas posibilidades en este per odo pero la industria y el comercio van a crecer poco no obstante al final de 2008 de todos modos habr crecimiento reitero que tendremos un a o menos bueno que 2007 eso est muy claro
8915955 a m me preocupa sobre todo el contexto internacional el mundo no sabe c mo sortear una situaci n en la que china ya no crece al 11 por ciento sino a la mitad en los ltimos diez a os ese ha sido el gran motor y teniendo cuenta eso colombia deber a pensar seriamente en aumentar sus reservas internacionales y llevarlas a niveles de 32 000 millones de d lares el a o entrante con el fin de enfrentar los problemas que surjan por la desaceleraci n en china e india
8915956 probablemente vamos a tener un a o 2009 con menores presiones inflacionarias relacionadas con alimentos y energ a si esa tendencia se mantiene vamos a tener un a o 2009 con un horizonte de inflaci n bastante mejor lo importante es que la oferta alimentaria colombiana crezca y de manera notoria en los pr ximos meses ste es un pa s que puede enfrentar altas inflaciones con un choque de oferta que espero llegue en el corto plazo
8915957 hay que volver a la agenda de competitividad agenda interna ya la seguridad por s sola no nos va a garantizar el crecimiento hay que volver a los temas de infraestructura de ciencia y tecnolog a y de desarrollo regional una vez el pa s ha alcanzado niveles de seguridad incluso m s altos que los de algunos de sus competidores en la regi n aqu lo que falta es volver a poner sobre la mesa todos esos aspectos relacionados con lo social
8915958 in the present international environment russias relations are logically going through a critical phase but for us it is clear that isolation is not a solution
8915959 we may have seen that there would be an impact on relations between nato and russia but we believe that every channel granted by the institutionalised nato russia dialogue must be exploited
8915960 someone has to explain to me what a sanction against russia would consist of
8915961 even in this serious political situation it remains valid to want to keep hold of some remnant of reason we are still going to have russia as a neighbour and it is in our own interest to return to a normal relationship
8915962 we are still in a phase of dialogue with moscow not in a phase of sanctions
8915963 a clear political signal of unity of the european union
8915964 there are still checkpoints manned by russian troops in georgia proper there is still a presence in poti which contravenes point five of the six point plan
8915965 just because theyre upset that the little pet of certain western capitals didnt fulfill their expectations
8915966 the georgian conflict shows that we must not increase our gas dependence
8915967 we must consider whether we should take similar precautions with gas that we do with oil
8915968 what about my diaper i wanna wear a diaper again toilet training never heard of it now back to the issue of me not having a diaper on my ass
8915969 our no 1 priority is just doing whats best for the students
8915970 nobody likes to see a school their children are attending closing
8915971 it will be upsetting for them change always is but they do want whats best for their children
8915972 what we have to think about what is in the best interests of the community and no 1 is what is in the best interests of the kids in our building
8915973 once the parents feel that the writing is on the wall i think they are going to know what is best for the children
8915974 well certainly all work together as a community and myself as principal with the parents and all the stakeholders and come up with the best solution and hopefully it will make everybody happy
8915975 weve got about a dozen schools with a 100 or fewer kids trying to staff those trying to provide them with the programs that the curriculum dictates in the year 2008 is almost impossible at this point in time
8915976 something has to be done the status quo is not an option
8915977 theres a fearfulness from people that want their community schools want to keep them we understand that

8915983 she comes out of this week in denver and the entire election season as a bigger and more powerful figure than she ever was before
8915984 we really do think of ourselves as players in a tv production
8915985 im a rancher who has made my living raising cattle
8915986 tenemos bastante afectada toda la infraestructura vial habitacional y educativa en el departamento por eso hay que tener muchas precauciones porque el invierno sigue
8915987 we must change and change until change is our master for no being
8915988 las altas dignidades del estado no pueden perder su rumbo pues por andar acus ndose y defendi ndose pueden llegar a distorsionar las funciones para las cuales fueron nombradas o elegidas
8915989 hoy la discusi n p blica est generando y est llegando a unos niveles de intolerancia que la verdad se pregunta uno c mo es posible pedirles tolerancia a las personas en los campos y en las ciudades cuando al nivel m s alto de la dirigencia pol tica no estamos mostrando la posibilidad de tener ese di logo constructivo
8915990 muchas veces el silencio conduce a la impunidad pol tica y por eso el gobierno responde

8916245 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
8916246 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti

8916252 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile

8916268 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
8916269 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
8916270 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
8916271 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
8916272 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
8916273 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
8916274 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
8916275 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
8916276 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
8916277 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema
8916278 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti

8916282 sedici anni fa mi avete dato lonore di guidare il nostro partito alla vittoria e guidare la nazione in una nuova era di pace e prosperit insieme abbiamo battuto i repubblicani in una campagna dura nella quale venivo attaccato perch troppo giovane e inesperto per essere il comandante supremo delle forze armate vi ricorda qualcosa nel 1992 non ha funzionato perch noi eravamo dalla parte giusta della storia e non funzioner neppure nel 2008 perch anche obama dalla parte giusta della storia
8916283 quello di sapere ispirare la gente infondere la speranza guidarla verso un orizzonte pi alto ha lintelligenza e la curiosit che non possono mancare in un presidente ha mostrato di avere una chiara comprensione della politica estera delle sfide sul fronte della sicurezza nazionale e una ferma determinazione a rimettere in sesto le nostre forze armate
8916284 il mio candidato non ha vinto ha voluto sottolineare ma sono orgoglioso della sua campagna elettorale e di tutta la gente che lha sostenuta hillary far di tutto per appoggiare obama e cos siamo in due anzi siamo 18 milioni
8916285 voglio che tutti sappiano che sono orgoglioso di avere joe biden e tutta la sua famiglia al mio fianco per riprenderci lamerica
8916286 hillary marted ha conquistato tutti e con bill avete visto cosa accade quando un presidente mette la gente al primo posto ci riprenderemo lamerica perch sono le persone normali a fare cose straordinarie

8916509 current bankruptcy law was not written with the perspective of systemic risk in mind
8916510 there is a big problem when large financial institutions are at the margin between solvency and insolvency the formal declaration that an important financial institution is insolvent could threaten the whole economy
8916511 the policies instituted by the treasury and the fed to deal with financial crises seem improvised rather than part of a consistent well articulated policy
8916512 there is still a risk that financial dominoes will begin to fall
8916513 if the bear stearns crisis had such a potential for disaster what will we do if a major hedge fund fails or if several crises happen at once
8916514 no one in the government seems to feel a responsibility for warning about such possibilities and formulating a detailed policy for dealing with them
8916515 the dreaded financial meltdown would amount to a wave of bankruptcies
8916516 preventing bear stearns from becoming the responsibility of the bankruptcy courts was one reason the fed felt that it had to act so quickly
8916517 he westbrook said the law might be changed in innovative ways so that in times of financial crisis when more is at stake than the fate of individual companies and their stakeholders troubled companies could be kept functioning longer
8916518 a subsidized system of triage would be needed to identify which companies should be saved with the main criterion being the possible economic impact of their liquidation
8916519 in this country we seem to get things right eventually

8916522 no puedo entender si no realmente en la malicia en la desinformaci n o en la desesperaci n estos conatos que confiando en la justicia en la seriedad de una entidad en la que creo que quien la preside hoy d a tendr todo el apoyo de la asamblea para que la verdad aflore no se puede quedar en sombras de duda sobre lo hecho en la asamblea
8916523 coincidentemente otros que son del mismo grupo del no o del no camuflado extra amente aparecen con un documento que seg n el contralor que me env a y entrega en mis manos el ltimo d a de la asamblea el 24 de julio
8916524 no tengo porque proteger ni ocultar lo que dice cualquier proceso de auditor a es que los informes que hacen los auditores no son la ltima palabra en este caso no tengo nada que ver en este caso si cree alguien que estoy tapando algo yo no tengo ninguna implicaci n pero no por eso me porto irresponsable hay 130 personas involucradas
8916525 el contralor de la rep blica con una advertencia que este documento es el nico un igual lo tengo yo el contralor tiene el uno guardado en su despacho y el otro tengo yo porque de acuerdo con el convenio se dice que terminado el informe se le entregar al presidente de la asamblea para el tr mite pertinente y la publicaci n
8916526 hay un asamble stas jorge escala que denuncia a fausto lupera porque una persona contratada por l vive fuera del pa s y funge como asesor del se or lupera la comisi n directiva de la asamblea el 5 de junio aprovechando la visita del contralor le proponemos la firma de un convenio
8916527 que se revise a todos los asamble stas eso fue solicitado y vigilado por nosotros para que se cumpla todos fuimos sometidos a vigilancia todos fuimos investigados y en ese caso esos resultado tienen que ser comunicados a nosotros que fuimos investigados
8916528 yo no respondo por ellos dicen que se est n enterando por la prensa habr a que apelar a los auditores para saber si les comunicaron o no porque en estos temas realmente hay que ser muy diligentes prolijos porque si no se generan nulidades y eso da an los procesos de auditor a
8916529 en algunos casos tengo evidencias de cartas de descargo pero que no han sido tramitadas en el propio procedimiento de la contralor a podr a estarse inobservado no por culpa de la contralor a si no por culpa del convenio el propio proceso de auditor a de la contralor a cuando llega a estos estados informa les llama a los involucrados y hace la lectura y permite el descargo
8916530 para m no es final y para nadie es final porque en definitiva cuando van a poder presentar los descargos en algunos casos he visto cartas que han presentado el descargo pero la contralor a dice ya no estamos actuando esto ya est en manos de la asamblea la asamblea es un rgano legislativo creado por el pueblo para hacer la constituci n no para hacer auditorias por eso le pedimos a la contralor a
8916531 esta tarde pedir al contralor que l mismo con todas las caracter sticas que tiene la auditor a de la contralor a en el mismo marco del convenio de colaboraci n contin en con el proceso porque es legitimo que se haga la lectura de este documento para que se puedan hacer los descargos independientemente de que el se or ministro fiscal contin e haciendo las investigaciones si es que hay presunciones de implicaciones penales
8916532 si han cometido eso que es grav simo de suplantar firmas personas de falsificar documentos p blicos que pena por ellos si eso fuera as pero me parece absurdo es contrario a la tica
8916533 no se puede hacer el esc ndalo de la magnitud que est n haciendo yo no tengo nada que ocultar lo que no negocio son mis principios creo en el debido proceso creo en la transparencia para que la verdad prevalezca
8916534 no puede ser posible que usando las viejas herramientas del viejo pa s de la partidocracia moribunda aparezca un joven que dice ser adem s de las personas que quieren un nuevo pa s que es de la patria activa y soberana y por hacer noticia caiga en estos actos tan corruptos como los que se quieren perseguir que en este caso es averiguar injuriar a personas que no tengo porque responsabilizarme de esta transgresi n
8916535 no he hecho p blico el documento porque para hacerlo p blico ten a que cumplir con un debido proceso el se or fiscal de la rep blica est haciendo lo que tiene que hacer y todo lo que implicar a el delito si todo eso esta precautelado porque tenemos que acelerar esta conferencia final en pleno momento de las elecciones
8916536 eso le toca dilucidar al ministerio fiscal que tiene que indagar si hay la falsificaci n de firmas si es que hay en este caso alteraci n de documentos si configura o no el peculado independientemente que yo no est involucrado en el caso a t tulo personal me parece que es un atentado contra la asamblea que se le quiera desnaturalizar a un proceso generado en la propia asamblea
8916537 estamos siendo sometidos a un chantaje por parte de la transportaci n
8916538 estamos siendo sometidos a un chantaje por parte de la transportaci n pero en todo caso en este momento vamos a tener una reuni n con ellos y con las autoridades del municipio de quito porque esta es una responsabilidad expresa del municipio de quito
8916539 a trav s de decretos ejecutivos fueron transferidas las competencias y entre esas competencias esta fijar tarifas
8916540 hasta que el municipio no asuma su responsabilidad como tal que se realicen los estudios necesarios para fijar una tarifa en base a los costos la oferta y la demanda en ese sentido el municipio tiene que cumplir para que en ese momento ellos puedan solicitar al ministerio de transporte o al estado la ayuda que sea necesaria
8916541 no hay estudios definitivos ellos han presentado un an lisis sobre la situaci n pero un informe sobre el tema no existe y no lo han presentado
8916542 la posici n del gobierno es que vamos a reunirnos vamos a escuchar a la transportaci n y luego se definir n las acciones que se tomar n pero no estamos de acuerdo con que la transportaci n se paralice
8916543 yo creo que cuando este rumor comenz este rumor mal infundado por el doctor rodrigo borja cevallos nosotros est bamos bastante peque os y se lo dej como un simple rumor que no se le dio importancia pero este rumor en lugar de desaparecer en estos doce a os que mi padre tiene en el exilio ha sido repetido tantas veces que hay una gran parte de la poblaci n que piensa que es cierto
8916544 pero m s all de eso yo creo que ahora que ya soy un hombre de 26 a os que tengo tres hijos y un hogar bendecido por dios y en mi calidad de director nacional del partido roldosista ecuatoriano pre creo que ah hay que hacer un alto a las cr ticas en contra de mi familia cada persona que utilice un medio de comunicaci n para afectar o lesionar el honor de la familia bucaram que es una familia que le ha dado tanto a la pol tica nacional y que el pueblo tanto ha querido y que ha sido v ctima precisamente de la partidocracia cada persona que injurie calumniosamente como est tipificado el delito de injuria calumniosa en el art culo 489 del c digo penal tiene que responder con pruebas a sus aseveraciones
8916545 entonces si el columnista emilio palacio sostiene que jacobo bucaram pulley se gan un mill n de d lares con la ayuda de su padre tendr que comprobarlo con pruebas en los tribunales judiciales caso contrario habr procedido a cometer el delito tipificado como antes lo mencion que injuria calumniosa que concluye con seis meses a dos a os de prisi n
8916546 porque lo vimos como una calumnia m s pero este rumor que se ha repetido tantos a os ha afectado mucho a la imagen de mi hermano entonces yo el tema no lo voy a defender apasionadamente con el coraz n sino en los tribunales judiciales
8916547 si el se or sostiene que esa mentira infundada es verdad bueno compru bemelo si no tiene las pruebas valederas para comprobarlo tendr que ir a la c rcel porque no se puede permitir que ning n ser humano acuse a una familia honorable o a cualquier miembro de una familia con aseveraciones que jur dicamente no puede respaldarlas si yo el d a de ma ana salgo a decir que el se or emilio palacio lo contrario se ha ganado un mill n de d lares en la prensa yo tengo que comprobarlo caso contrario tengo que pagar por mis aseveraciones que no est n sustentadas en el campo del derecho
8916548 yo soy abogado y voy a actuar no solo como hermano hastiado y cansado y como hijo hastiado y cansado de que se hable de mi familia las personas pueden tener el derecho de decir lo que les d la gana de otras personas pero tienen que comprobarlo no pueden adjudicarle un delito de tal magnitud y ante un medio de comunicaci n que te ven millones de personas y salir a repetir rumores que t consideras verdaderos si son rumores que t consideras verdaderos y los aseveras como lo asever el columnista emilio palacio en el programa contacto directo dirigido por carlos vera en la se al de ecuavisa tienes que probarlo ese es mi nico punto de vista
8916549 si el se or el d a de ma ana me presenta en los campos judiciales estados de cuenta dep sitos que demuestren que su rumor es cierto est bien entonces habr comprobado ese rumor mal infundado en los campos judiciales pero si no tiene c mo probarlo como estoy seguro de que as ser porque como hermano puedo dar fe y como cristiano practicante como cristiano activo puedo dar fe de que mi hermano jam s cometi el delito entonces no va a tener c mo probarlo y tendr que pagar por sus aseveraciones
8916550 yo creo que ese fue su error yo creo que l debi haber desmentido desde un principio ese rumor pero bueno uno nunca sabe c mo terminan las cosas solo sabe c mo comienzan
8916551 ahora yo voy a buscar verdaderos culpables aparte del doctor palacio en la confesi n judicial a la cual voy a llamar al doctor palacio voy a decir que me diga la fuente de donde l sac esta informaci n porque fue el doctor rodrigo borja cevallos y todas las personas que comenzaron este mal rumor tendr n que pagarlo en los campos judiciales de no tener c mo comprobarlo
8916552 quiero que me digan d nde se realiz esa fiesta d nde estuvo esa plata porque inclusive yo tengo reportes de la poca del a o 97 en el cual mi hermano jacobo bucaram fueron cerradas sus cuentas por falta de fondos y no pod a abrir cuentas en el pa s sino hasta hace dos o tres a os por falta de fondos
8916553 m s all de no tener fondos en sus cuentas si jacobo bucaram pulley se hubiese robado un mill n de d lares usted cree que podr a transitar libremente en este pa s si abdal bucaram ortiz por suponer que ha delinquido con el estado y por haberle adjudicado un decreto que l no firm y que l no pag como es el de la mochila escolar que el desembolso lo hizo el gobierno de fabi n alarc n por lo tanto no entiendo c mo pudo haber peculado si no hubo desembolso no hubo dolo no hubo perjuicio al estado pero como en este pa s as se ha manejado la justicia en beneficio de febres cordero y de jaime nebot y el partido social cristiano y la izquierda democr tica este tipo de rumores se han considerado ciertos y abdal bucaram tiene doce a os fuera de su patria

8916630 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8916631 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight on nov
8916632 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush

8916636 the second law of thermodynamics trumps the laws of economics
8916637 if the world was made of oil there would still be a finite supply of it
8916638 if kindness and comfort are as i suspect the results of an energy surplus then as the supply contracts we could be expected to start fighting once again like cats in a sack
8916639 one of our central tasks is the creation of the post oil megacity
8916640 i spoke to manchester united director david gill and he always said that the club did not want to sell ronaldo
8916641 i asked him about it obviously because i thought we could do something
8916642 it was the same with villarreal president fernando roig when i asked about santi cazorla he said no and that was that
8916643 with cazorla we could have signed him if we had wanted to but we did not want to pay his buy out clause five days before the transfer window closes
8916644 that was why we did not sign him although villarreal have seen things differently
8916645 in the case of villa they offered him to us for 80m and he was never part of our plans for that amount i do not understand why that turned out like that
8916646 it did not appear that kak s position needed strengthening according to the coaches i did not enter into it
8916647 i have to say that it was a possibility to sign kak this summer but i was told that we did not need him now
8916648 he may have cost 100m but i do not think that would have been the price but those in charge told me not to look into it
8916649 personally i think saying he wanted to leave was a mistake and that it was a problem with him i think his representatives advised him badly and they confused him
8916650 but once it had been said it was my job to defend the interests if the club in the best way that i could
8916651 we did not consider selling him even if cristiano had joined robinho was not going it would not have been necessary to sell anyone
8916652 i have said before that all this came down to a problem of communication more than anything else
8916653 the media become involved and then we wanted to sort it out with the player and his club but we became spectators and had no role to play in it all
8916654 we received the news that player wanted to come to madrid but as i said throughout it was down to manchester united to say whether or not they would sell him
8916655 the player still has a contract with his club and there is nothing more that we can do i am not thinking about next summer now because i do not know what could happen
8916656 we just do not know if he will end up playing here or not i hope he can but that is another matter
8916657 there was no call from ronaldo saying he was not coming i do not want to give the impression that we interfered in any way with all this because we did not
8916658 the relationship between manchester united and real madrid is magnificent still although it did bother me that their manager made some comments but we will remain friends

8916683 the answer is unclear but probably no while mccain has positioned himself as pro life during this campaign his statements over the years show considerable latitude on the issue
8916684 i think it is outrageous that people give him a pass as they gave george w bush a pass
8916685 this training is incredibly important for us because we want to take back georgias lost territories
8916686 the georgians are euphoric because they have been equipped trained that they have gained military experience in iraq it feeds this revanchist mood how can south ossetia be demilitarized when all of georgia is bristling with weaponry and its only an hours ride by tank from tbilisi to tskhinvali

8916850 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
8916851 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro l orizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
8916852 ogni santa notte ogni volta che chiudo gli occhi lei li ogni volta che la mia mente vuota lei la occupa oh wiliam quando tu non ci sei io mi sento cos inutile cos debole e lei mi logora dallinterno mi sento come se fossi divisa in miliardi di coriandoli tutti senza senso e tu non so come riesci a dargli quel senso riesci a farmi sentire che esisto quando invece io non so pi chi sono non lo so pi
8916853 ho visto te fra lei sue braccia ho sentito il male che ti ha fatto dalla prima volta che sei entrato in questa stanza penso che questa sia colpa tua
8916854 tu hai risvegliato la parte peggiore di me quella che mi faceva male ho rivisto frammenti del suo e del tuo passato ho visto come la guardavi ed anche se non volevo credere che fossi tu quel ragazzo inconsciamente io invidiavo natalie perch so che non potrai mai guardarmi come guardavi lei
8916855 ho sentito la sua perfidia lei mi perseguita mi dice che non sono niente e che tu gli apparterrai per leternit
8916856 ero gi un vampiro allepoca lei non lo sapeva o almeno io non glielo avevo confessato me ne innamorai perdutamente nellistante i cui la vidi
8916857 era bellissima fui superficiale a limitarmi allapparenza cominciai a frequentare il suo castello ogni giorno ogni notte sorgeva proprio qui questa era la sua stanza
8916858 decisi di dirle la verit ero stupidamente sicuro che lei mi amasse solo ora so quanto mi stessi sbagliando non so come ma venne a conoscenza della mia natura da sola allepoca circolavano strane dicerie sui vampiri si diceva che mangiando le nostre carni si poteva ottenere limmortalit senza linconveniente della dannazione
8916859 ma io non volevo vedere non volevo sentire volevo solo lei lultima sera che la vidi nella sua stanza fui attaccato da un esercito di vampiri allora non potevo pi sfuggire dalla realt
8916860 ero forte ma non cos forte per sfuggire ad un esercito lei era li di fronte a me mentre gli altri mi tenevano in modo che non potessi sfuggire non so come riusc a farsi ubbidire da quei vampiri non so nemmeno cosa promise loro in cambio mi disse il suo desiderio ed il suo intento mi aveva venduto ad una nobile famiglia del tempo in cambio di qualche trancio della mia carne lei voleva limmortalit la bellezza eterna lunica cosa importante per lei mi disse che avrebbe mangiato le miei carni che in questo modo avrebbe esaudito anche il mio desiderio essere parte di lei per sempre capii che era pazza che ero stato uno stupido a cercare qualcosa di cos profondo come lamore in una come lei ale era cos fredda cos vuota
8916861 mi fece rinchiudere nelle segrete del suo palazzo quello fu il suo unico errore piegai le sbarre di quella prigione avevo un solo desiderio ucciderla
8916862 rotornai nelle sue stanze alla mia vista i suoi occhi si riempirono di paura di terrore e ne fui felice perch in qualche modo ero riuscito a fargliprovare almeno unemozione alla fine non fui in grado di ucciderla
8916863 la baciai unultima volta cercando di trasmetterle tutto lodio che avevo tutto il ribrezzo me ne andai e non la rividi mai pi ora so cosa le accadde
8916864 lunica cosa che seppi dopo essermene andato che il suo esercito fin col distruggersi da solo soltanto uno si salv a quello scempio gli augur di subire tutte le pene dellinferno gli promise che lavrebbe perseguitata ovunque in ongi vita qualunque forma avesse assunto lui lavrebbe perseguitata sarebbe stato la sua paura pi grande
8916865 poi mi allontanai cos tanto da quel luogo da questo luogo che lei per me non divenne altro che un amaro ricordo un ricordo nitido del mio orgoglio ferito del mio cuore infranto un ricordo che mi perseguitava ed al quale non potevo sottrarmi la mia punizione per aver assaggiato il frutto proibito poi decisi di tornare ed te che ho incontrato tu risvegliasti tutto quel dolore che mi sembrava di tenere sepolto tu eri identica a lei to odiai per questo ti odiai con tutte le mie forze inizialmente pensavo addirittura che tu fossi lei che in qualche modo era riuscita a restare in vita io lo speravo
8916866 gi non sei nemmeno lontanamente paragonabile a lei per fortuna
8916867 e tu mi portasti qui qui dove tutto era cominciato decisi allora che qui anche tutto sarebbe finito ma tu non eri una normale ragazza di questa epoca
8916868 avvertisti subito la mia presenza e questo mi spavent ma ormai avevo deciso tu mi avresti liberato da tutte le mie pene poi a tutto questo si aggiunse il tuo profumo cos dolce cos intenso e la ciliegina sulla torta pensai sarebbe stato tutto pi semplice naturale io ero il vampiro tu la preda ma i tuoi occhi il tuo modo di fare il dubbio cominci a d insinuarsi nei miei pensieri tu non eri lei mi sentii un mostro eppure capii immediatamente di non essere pi capace di allontanarmi da te tu eri una perfida illusione per me lillusione che natalie fosse ancora li per me che fosse diversa
8916869 avanti avanti fa quello per cui sei venuto quella dannata sera mettiamo fine a questo stupido gioco
8916870 ti sto solo chiedendo di rendere concreto ci che in realt hai gi fatto
8916871 va bene se ci che vuoi far ci per cui venni quella sera
8916872 era per questo che ero venuto quella sera non ti avrei mai morsa
8916873 no resister perch ora tu sei pi importante del mio istinto tu sei pi importante di tutto
8916874 voglio che tu lo sappia non sei come lei tu sei tutto ci che ho sempre desiderato tu sei lamore della mia eternit
8916875 the vampire and me 2 quando passato e presente si mescolano
8916876 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
8916877 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro l orizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
8916878 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
8916879 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro l orizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
8916880 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8916881 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8916882 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8916883 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8916884 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8916885 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8916886 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8916887 who are open to doing something on the production side
8916888 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8916889 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8916890 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8916891 it certainly flies in the face of the spirit of financial disclosure
8916892 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8916893 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8916894 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8916895 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8916896 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8916897 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8916898 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8916899 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8916900 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8916901 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8916902 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8916903 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8916904 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8916905 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8916906 salt of the earth neices and nephews of uncle sam with apologies to those in other countries this is a friday five about labor all can play put down that hammer that spoon that rolling pin that rake that pen that commentary that lexicon and lets have some fun
8916907 i have her blood on my shirt look i have merkins blood on my shirt im never going to wash it
8916908 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8916909 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8916910 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8916911 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8916912 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8916913 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8916914 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8916915 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8916916 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8916917 all of us at showtime wish david and his family the best during this very private time

8916919 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8916920 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8916921 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8916922 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8916923 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8916924 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8916925 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8916926 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8916927 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8916928 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8916929 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8916930 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8916931 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8916932 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8916933 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8916934 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8916935 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8916936 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8916937 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8916938 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8916939 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8916940 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8916941 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8916942 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8916943 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8916944 the only bills that i voted for for the most part since ive been in the senate were introduced by republicans with george bush
8916945 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8916946 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8916947 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8916948 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8916949 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8916950 there was only me and a young girl in the shop at the time and thankfully she was at the counter end of the shop

8916955 e un grande giocatore dice il tecnico nerazzurro a proposito del talento doriano lho studiato e ho pensato a lui durante la settimana lo rispetto perch bravo la samp ha fatto molto bene lanno scorso e in casa ha perso solo due volte ma il nostro obiettivo resta quello di vincere

8916969 hopefully many of you had the chance to visit wacken open air this summer playing in front of around 80 000 people was truly amazing the whole concert was like one magic moment moreover we had brought along our viking ship which is something we do only at very special events it was just a pity that you couldnt see all of the great visual effects of the show because the sun was still shining at 8 00pm and it was not dark enough we brought a lot of extra lights and fx gear including a big projection screen and animations to each of the songs our crew prepared everything one day before and worked until 6 am in the morning as always they did an outstanding job no sleep until the ship is ready on stage to make this dream come true i have no words to express how grateful we all are towards our crew the wacken organisors and towards everybody else helping the band in any way a big thank you to the audience to all the fans who came to wacken to support us and travelled a long way to see us thanks also to drummer alex holzwarth for helping us out at the show the recordings of our third full length album are almost completed as well its such a wonderful thing to work in our own amazing newly built mastersound studio however in the middle of everything happening i decided to travel back home to norway with my family to gather more information and inspiration for future concepts and lyrics we spent many days by the sea and travelled through the fjords and up into the mountains i will surely give some of these experiences and images back to you on our next album

8916975 ive always wanted to give our players and program an international experience
8916976 there is no better place to give them an international baseball experience than the dominican republic utilizing our alumni contacts of david howard with the mets and sandy alderson with the padres we were able to set up these games this allows our players a cultural and baseball experience they could not get anywhere else
8916977 we do not have all of the data right now but we know that nm100060 is safe with no adverse events
8916978 i am very surprised by this setback it is a major detour in our growth plan but we are still moving forward with novartis toward the ultimate goal of getting our product commercialized
8916979 we have been hearing about purple since it burst on the scene late last year and are pleased to bring this exciting product to our customers

8916995 i felt a single troubadour all alone on the stage could change the world if he knew what he was doing
8916996 by winning in durban last weekend we have presented ourselves with an opportunity to win back to back test matches in south africa which is not only rare in an australian context but is also historically significant across the game in general
8916997 we owe it to ourselves and to everyone who is associated with australian rugby to make the most of that opportunity
8916998 the peter de villiers game plan is all about adding decision making to structure and we are stuck at the moment at decision making
8916999 but i back the players and i want them to keep going out and playing whats in front of them the win will come because we have very good players

8917007 i have an incredible amount of vintage that ive collected over the years
8917008 i do almost everything in jeans except sleep denim has become so high priced as of late my friends back home dont want to spend 250 for a pair of jeans i want them to be able to walk into a medium priced store and be able to afford a cool pair of jeans for less than 100 bucks
8917009 but michael laughed and said im not so sure that youd want to see me eat
8917010 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8917011 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
8917012 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
8917013 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
8917014 soon there will be no north or south ossetia there will be a united alania as part of russia

8917017 there was only me and a young girl in the shop at the time and thankfully she was at the counter end of the shop
8917018 i rushed out and gave the man a chair he was very shaken up
8917019 because she thinks its hilarious and she is a major major fan of alecs
8917020 i dont get upset because i have answered this question many times theres no need to explain anymore
8917021 we need to improve the level of intervention built into the schedule

8917027 they do have mashed potatoes and biscuits so in a pinch a very hungry vegetarian can get vegetarian food there which is what we assume sophie was doing
8917028 we did not kill up to 90 civilians as has been alleged
8917029 ive seen the account stated from both the u n and certainly from the afghan government ive also seen it discussed that in fact that didnt happen
8917030 we know that when collateral damage occurs that it really does set us back so we work exceptionally hard to make sure that doesnt happen
8917031 were looking to do that as rapidly as we can
8917032 we believe that the 12 executions were an isolated incident and not part of a strategy to destabilize the state

8917037 seinfeld was hit with the slander suit because he called author missy chase lapine who claims his wife jessica copied her cookbook a
8917038 slander is an untruthful oral spoken statement about a person that harms the persons reputation or standing in the community
8917039 if i knew it was going to be that kind of party id stick my dick in the mashed potatoes
8917040 she claims that jessica seinfeld stole her ideas about hiding healthy veggies in pudding and brownies for the cookbook
8917041 i personally live about 10 miles from the plant and i felt it
8917042 our back was turned and it was like somebody shined a giant spotlight on us
8917043 i thought my house was falling down on top of me thats how hard the vibration was
8917044 people should be confident they have not been exposed to highly dangerous chemicals

8917049 officers have completed a search of the outbuildings and are now in the process of removing vehicles from the site
8917050 we have completed a cursory search of the annexe part of the main building which is relatively intact following the fire

8917054 i want to get what do you think of that
8917055 youll want to learn it everything you learn now you will use every day for the rest of your life
8917056 aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent
8917057 regardless it appears that to a great degree veoh may have complied with section 512 c to a proverbial t
8917058 t he key to veohs victory was its scrupulous attention to the dmca safe harbors
8917059 unlike mrsa there is no way of screening for c difficile so the most important thing to get right is cleanliness
8917060 patients staff and visitors can carry the bacteria into a hospital without knowing it or become infected in the community thats why handwashing is so important
8917061 we use chlorine based cleaners and have antimicrobial disposable curtains that we remove after an infected patient has been in a ward
8917062 it was so thorough that afterwards the wheels on the beds seized up they would not run properly because theyd been cleaned of oil
8917063 the most important thing when you suspect an infection is to isolate the patient quickly even before you get the test results back from the lab
8917064 if you give patients broad spectrum antibiotics designed to kill all bacteria they get rid of even the types that help keep c difficile at bay
8917065 maidstone has had a tragic wake up call and had to undertake a crash course in infection control but some trusts still have work to do its something that they ignore at their peril
8917066 we try really hard not to put elderly people in chairs
8917067 its awful its the worst its been for years were powerless to do anything
8917068 staff are being pushed to the limits it is a bottleneck it is a shambles and it is only going to get worse
8917069 we havent been able to get a private patient into a private hospital for weeks theyre full too
8917070 im not sure suspending elective surgery for a week would be enough it might take two
8917071 what i do expect is hospital management to make decisions on a daily basis about what is in the best interests of providing safe patient care
8917072 if that means theyve got to temporarily suspend elective surgery then unfortunately if that decision is made in the interests of patient safety i support that i would rather that not be the case but thats the reality of the very busy times we are experiencing at the moment
8917073 people dont get fed properly people get sleep deprived the staff get frustrated as well it leads to a whole snowball effect
8917074 i can give you three instances of elderly people falling out of trolleys because they were confused they should never have been on trolleys in the emergency department
8917075 increasing the amount of time that patients spend in an emergency department leads to deaths
8917076 the number of long stay patients in queensland emergency departments has skyrocketed in the last couple of months

8917081 is to achieve quasi legal status for mexican illegals in the united states without waiting for action from washington
8917082 the department of justice and fbi have concluded the matricula consular is not a reliable form of identification due to the non existence of any means of verifying the true identity of the card holder
8917083 at least one individual of middle eastern descent has also been arrested in possession of the matricula consular card

8917091 the animating principle of my faith as taught to me by church and home was that the cardinal sin was abuse of power
8917092 it was not only required as a good catholic to abhor and avoid abuse of power but to do something to end that abuse
8917093 i get comfort from carrying my rosary going to mass every sunday its my time alone
8917094 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that

8917110 i personally believe that negotiations on the partnership and cooperation agreement is one of the issues which we have to address very carefully
8917111 the title of the agreement is partnership and cooperation we have to make sure what kind of partnership we are talking about and is this really the right time to talk about this partnership

8917118 proving that we can directly measure amyloid beta in the human brain is an important step forward for both clinical and basic research and that may be true not just in alzheimers disease but also in other serious neurological disorders
8917119 we havent measured how brain injury affects amyloid beta inside cells nor have we determined whether brain injury affects the ability of amyloid beta to form small aggregates that may be especially harmful
8917120 our ultimate goal is to develop interventions that we can apply after a traumatic brain injury to improve outcomes and reduce the long term risk of alzheimers
8917121 the results have potentially important clinical implications because the measurement of amyloid beta in the human brain may turn out to be a good indicator of how well brain cells are communicating with each other even in very sick patients
8917122 if the results are validated in further studies this may assist physicians in making important patient management decisions in patients with acute neurological disorders

8917125 the education being afforded is excellent and parents understand that
8917126 the negotiation with them it was very terrible and very materialistic and was very greedy they were asking for money and more money and more money and more money
8917127 without that letter we would not be able to get rid of the sanctions at all i admit that we played with words
8917128 the phone has been plugged in since it was charged
8917129 it is now just 10 months before the expensive experiment that is mayoral control of gothams public schools is set to expire and as parents ready their children for the start of classes tuesday the news has been released that the average s a t scores have declined here once again there was no press extravaganza no power point presentations no top officials union leaders at their side beaming as the results were outlined no troubling test results turn out to be an orphan
8917130 if there is a trend to be found here it is this whenever someone other than the state of new york administers a test scores here are flat or even go down but when those kind folks from albany come on the scene scores on their tests magically increase a phenomenon that explains the increases in graduation rates as well

8917143 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8917144 spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8917145 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8917146 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8917147 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 per cent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8917148 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety per cent of the time
8917149 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8917150 next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8917151 and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough

8917164 are you sure you want to live like common people
8917165 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8917166 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8917167 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8917168 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8917169 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8917170 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8917171 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8917172 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8917173 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8917174 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8917175 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8917176 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8917177 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8917178 no one works for someone we all just work together
8917179 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8917180 oh you can go ahead then i will come walking
8917181 hey please give these books to benji he is leaving for his home in next 15 min he needs these books badly i will sms him that you are bringing the books i am going to cauvery theatre for god tussi great ho okay bye i am in a hurry
8917182 a bottle broke in the lab and there was a cut i am going to the health center
8917183 bhondoo where are you roaming yaar benji is waiting for his books come on lets go to the hostel
8917184 he is already late he will miss the train come
8917185 how will i carry them while driving you idiot now dont give foolish reasons just get on
8917186 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8917187 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8917188 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8917189 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8917190 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8917191 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8917192 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8917193 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8917194 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8917195 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8917196 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8917197 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8917198 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8917199 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8917200 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8917201 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8917202 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8917203 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8917204 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8917205 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8917206 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8917207 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8917208 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8917209 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8917210 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8917211 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8917212 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8917213 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8917214 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone

8917249 ive seen vampire venom work miracles but there are conditions that even venom cannot overcome
8917250 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8917251 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8917252 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8917253 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8917254 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8917255 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8917256 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8917257 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8917258 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8917259 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8917260 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8917261 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8917262 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8917263 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8917264 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8917265 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8917266 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8917267 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8917268 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8917269 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8917270 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8917271 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8917272 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8917273 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8917274 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8917275 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8917276 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8917277 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8917278 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8917279 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8917280 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8917281 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8917282 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8917283 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8917284 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8917285 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8917286 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8917287 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

8917304 my beautician told me she already booked an extra hotel room someplace up north called branton and we could stay there
8917305 everybody should be looking at their plans just like were looking at our plans and get ready
8917306 if they dont have a plan you still have time if you wait until the storms on top of you thats when panics going to set in and you dont think wisely
8917307 the state its local and federal partners are better prepared than weve ever been before for a major storm
8917308 although we have made strides in rebuilding our infrastructure the levees have not been fully repaired and we have an 800 million budget gap to complete our sewage and water systems

8917318 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8917319 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8917320 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county

8917322 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8917323 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8917324 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8917325 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8917326 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8917327 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8917328 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

8917764 for too long credit card companies have been using unfair and deceptive practices to trick americans into signing agreements they cant afford
8917765 credit card issuers were going to face an uphill battle if obama won regardless of the vice presidential choice
8917766 our point is that biden is unlikely to moderate obamas approach to credit card legislation as vice president whereas he could have been a moderating influence on credit card legislation if he had remained in the senate
8917767 to us that means this selection is a negative for the credit card issuers
8917768 visa mastercard and amex have influence beyond biden so does the american bankers association they will be able to make their case
8917769 joe biden represents the state of delaware where the credit card companies are a major industry so joe biden voted in a way that was overwhelmingly popular in his state and barack obama didnt thats a story

8917776 if there is a moment in my career where i regret a decision it was clearly the day after the fa cup final when my agent told me club x want you tomorrow and i told him no i love it here and i dont want to go i want to stay
8917777 thats the moment i regret after that day after that final i should have left chelsea and i would have the chance in wembley to say goodbye to the fans and to say goodbye to english football so thats a moment i regret because the next season lasted only a couple of months
8917778 i only have friends in chelsea and i have problems with nobody but if i stayed there one two three four more weeks probably in this moment i wouldnt say this
8917779 i love that club im in the history of that club and i left the club in the right moment to feel like that and to say that honestly

8917789 if present at all was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
8917790 while such a reduction in all cause mortality would have been impressive these mortality benefits are likely implausible previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated a healthy user benefit or frailty bias
8917791 over the last two decades in the united sates even while vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality further only about 10 percent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 percent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion

8917794 being a producer allows me to develop material that says something to me to make movies i can be proud of

8917800 pretty much left us alone to make the movie we wanted

8917810 its easier for president graham spanier and the board of trustees to say no to three more years its more difficult when all the old man wants is another year even if he may want one more for the next few years
8917811 the bottom line is he doesnt want anybody to tell him that he wants to decide himself if he can have a great year maybe the lightbulb goes off that its time but dont bet on it
8917812 and if he stumbles to 7 5 or worse maybe the choice wont be his anymore

8917891 i know police are very well protected with their pensions and so on but in the police things can happen when you are very young people assume they are going to be all right but thats not always the case a lot of people who leave the police leave with a serious illness its quite surprising how often that happens
8917892 in those days there werent widows benefits or things like that and people werent usually insured nowadays people have life insurance because they own homes which wasnt so common then

8917897 because of her injury she finds sitting difficult and driving is impossible weve been able to support her with household stuff like an orthopedic bed for her back when youve only got five years service you dont get much of a pension but its nice to get her something because her career was ended
8917898 he had serious illnesses after that but everything could be related in some way to when he lost his leg

8917915 the support by our sponsors to make our business combination happen has been unprecedented and indicates tangibly their belief in the positive fundamentals of the dry bulk sector and their faith in seanergys management to deliver shareholder value for the long term
8917916 seanergy commences its operations at a time when the dry bulk sector enjoys strong fundamentals with robust demand and attractive freight rates our strong cash flow generation due to the attractive charter rates we have secured for our initial fleet enables us to support a dividend payout of 64 of our distributable cash flow while retaining the rest for growth given our moderate leverage access to bank financing and expected capital inflow from the conversion of warrants we believe that seanergy is strategically positioned to take advantage of the positive market environment

8917923 we shouldnt be complacent theres still people who are clearly getting into difficulty with both these illegal drugs but its very welcome news that weve had this massive decline in reported cannabis use and a smaller decline in amphetamine use
8917924 its consistent with other reports that have been coming in from previous surveys and certainly from an early schools survey weve been getting indications so i think it is very welcome news
8917925 i dont think we should take this as an indication that illegal drug problems have gone away
8917926 the number of people smoking cannabis falling as it has shows that the health message is getting through that its bad to smoke and its dangerous to smoke cannabis

8917980 i was glad to be able to get the big hits some of us have been unable to pick up lately
8917981 i am writing all the time i love composing and the whole thing but i am also raising my children and enjoying it and teaching them to ride bicycles and how to read i love it
8917982 we go to the arcade and go to the movies and do things i want them to get to do the kind of things i didnt get to do so i fill them with a lot of enjoyment that way a lot of amusement you know
8917983 i wasnt particularly big at secondary school so i played as a striker
8917984 romario and careca were my playground heroes but i didnt start playing for the school team until i was 14 which was quite late i know
8917985 but i was an average striker nothing special then at the age of 15 or 16 i really started to shoot up i quickly grew to 6ft tall then a bit more and it was then that i started playing as a goalkeeper but it was a position that came to me by accident i never wanted to play there i always wanted the adulation of scoring goals
8917986 there are some stadiums you are not comfortable in but i had an affinity with white hart lane that night it was a nice memory i took with me
8917987 the grass was perfect the stadium enclosed and i felt at ease straight away playing here showed me the passion for football in this country
8917988 i cant remember how it started but when i come out i head for the goal and try to get my shoulders clear of the crossbar i do two on one side two on the other basically im saying im here and im ready to go and hopefully the spurs fans will embrace it
8917989 everyone wants to play in the big arenas on the big stage and the potential for champions league football is here at tottenham thats why i joined the club
8917990 the players being signed are players that have international experience and when you add that to the quality already in the squad we can push the top sides in england
8917991 there are similarities with when i first went to psv young exciting players mixed with a few more experienced heads its the best combination you can have and that was proved by the fact that we almost reached the final it would be my dream to see tottenham competing at that same level and we can do it we really can
8917992 i think were lucky to have the most recognisable and largest icon in all of sport playing ours
8917993 if tiger was not around and i was able to be the no 1 player in the world id be making half as much money as i am now because of him
8917994 i am very thankful for the fact that hes in our sport and hes had the success and the charisma and the lure to attract corporate america as well as fans to the game were all fortunate
8917995 the game of golf suffers when hes not in the field
8917996 it was a fun tournament last year i loved the opportunity to have won the tournament but i also love the way it happened with the opportunity to play three rounds with tiger
8917997 the opportunity to have one of the best fields in golf for these fedexcup events and to be able to come out on top was a lot of fun
8917998 ive played the same way ive played throughout the year i just havent been scoring the way i would like

8918061 hezbollah must explain and not justify what happened because the death of a brilliant officer cannot be justified whatever the circumstances of the incident
8918062 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities
8918063 it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders

8918123 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8918124 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8918125 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8918126 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8918127 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8918128 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8918129 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8918130 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8918131 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8918132 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8918133 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8918134 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8918135 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8918136 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8918137 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8918138 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8918139 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8918140 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8918141 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8918142 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8918143 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8918144 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8918145 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8918146 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8918147 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8918148 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8918149 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8918150 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8918151 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8918152 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

8918163 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8918164 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8918165 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8918166 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8918167 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8918168 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8918169 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8918170 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8918171 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8918172 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8918173 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8918174 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8918175 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8918176 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

8918179 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8918180 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8918181 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8918182 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8918183 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8918184 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8918185 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8918186 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8918187 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8918188 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8918189 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8918190 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
8918191 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
8918192 we do know for example that many of the earliest lyric poems in middle english known from surviving fragments and references were the words of popular songs and sayings of uneducated unlettered people

8918220 weve got what weve got and people might move on or we might just have a little bit of room in the budget for one more player but it would be a really tight push
8918221 there will be one or two coming down to training this week as they are now getting released from other clubs as the transfer deadlines are coming up
8918222 there will be one or two around and maybe this will give our lads a kick up the backside
8918223 when you look at our current form and the fact theyve had a bad start then its a game we can win

8918261 i thought our coaches prepared our team well but i was still nervous
8918262 weve always played well as an underdog but i was really concerned with the top 25 ranking coming in here
8918263 being ranked is nice but it puts a target on your back
8918264 people expect you to win this game we knew it would be a tough battle we played well but theyre still some things left well have to work on
8918265 people were getting open and they were making it easy on me making their catches
8918266 we need to be efficient to score a lot of points like this basically we took what they were giving us i was really happy how everybody played
8918267 every coachs nightmare is opening on the road especially against a good team in a major conference

8918269 as the chairman of seanergy i am very proud that as of today we will be an operating company in this attractive shipping sector our strategic vision is to position seanergy among the shipping industry leaders and generate shareholder value for the long term
8918270 the support by our sponsors to make our business combination happen has been unprecedented and indicates tangibly their belief in the positive fundamentals of the dry bulk sector and their faith in seanergys management to deliver shareholder value for the long term
8918271 seanergy commences its operations at a time when the dry bulk sector enjoys strong fundamentals with robust demand and attractive freight rates our strong cash flow generation due to the attractive charter rates we have secured for our initial fleet enables us to support a dividend payout of 64 of our distributable cash flow while retaining the rest for growth given our moderate leverage access to bank financing and expected capital inflow from the conversion of warrants we believe that seanergy is strategically positioned to take advantage of the positive market environment
8918272 by teaming with ibm iss our objective is to both strengthen our security systems and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our security operations

8918295 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong

8918336 many who were involved in the liberation struggle underground have never had their story told not even their mothers knew what they were doing but these anonymous practitioners are passing away and there is a sense of urgency about capturing their stories before they are lost but part of the difficulty is trying to find the stories the original tellers of this tales because of the highly secretive nature of the underground often we dont even know who were looking for and the very training that instilled the sense of secrecy makes it hard for these stories to now be told

8918339 the way one operates in the underground stays with one even today long after it is appropriate when i go to interview somebody in limpopo they still ask their commanders permission to talk to me even though i have a history in the struggle they take pride in saying nothing and one has to extract the story like a dentist in some instances it is too late and we dont even know where to look there is the special bravery of those who wore the uniform of those who wore the uniform of the oppressors and the puppets

8918401 kevin ray and myself we sacrificed so much we got all sorts of rewards in this league but we never got to the mountain top today its a breath of fresh air
8918402 this is unreal from where we came from a year ago
8918403 you guys stuck with me and now were bringing home championship number 17
8918404 ive seen some pretty stiff defences and this was right up there with them
8918405 they definitely were the best defence ive seen in the entire play offs
8918406 kobe started off that game with a hot hand and then his legs you could see his shot was flat
8918407 he didnt get his shot going and it really changed the course of the game he started out so strong and then he only made three field goals the rest of the game so that really was a change
8918408 one of the things they did is they really focused on him and made sure that he wasnt going to be the guy that hurt them and we didnt have guys step up in this instance tonight
8918409 that was the first thing i thought of what he would say
8918410 i laughed because i thought he would say its about time

8918413 sicuramente bayern e fiorentina il bayern sta affrontando un momento un po delicato ma resta la squadra pi forte del girone perch ha dei giocatori in grado di risolvere la partita da un momento allaltro i viola tornano ai massimi livelli del calcio europeo dopo essere partiti addirittura dalla quarta divisione quindi potrebbero peccare di inesperienza ma ho visto la squadra giocare contro i rangers quando nonostante il risultato finale imposero sempre il loro gioco
8918414 li ho visti giocare sabato in avanti sono molto forti ma sono vulnerabili in difesa e vero che il lione ha unesperienza decennale in champions league ma il lione di oggi non pi quello di due o tre anni fa
8918415 e molto difficile giocare sul loro campo ma allo stesso tempo hanno spesso dimostrato di andare in crisi quando affrontano squadre di alto livello

8918420 ryanair is continuing to cancel bookings made through this unauthorised ticket tout website and has called on the european commission as well as national governments to take action to prevent this illegal and unlawful mis selling to consumers
8918421 sadly we are still waiting for the european commission to take any action to protect consumers but we live in hope
8918422 when you look at who we could have got then i suppose you have to say weve been a bit unlucky but were still fully confident
8918423 they gave liverpool a decent game and they are clearly a good side but we know what the european games are all about now after last season and were looking forward to it
8918424 if you get to the uefa cup you cant expect any easy rides but we know a fair bit about liege and well know a lot more by the time we play them
8918425 we were at home first against metalist last season and even though that didnt go too well we did enough over two legs to get through
8918426 the last goodison game in europe had just about the best atmosphere ive ever played and i cant wait to run out again in this one
8918427 the evertonians will have a big part to play there is no doubt about that
8918428 i need a moment to catch my breath and try to get my life back together
8918429 if they dont think there will be retaliation theyre crazy
8918430 i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough

8918432 anil what are you talking about no more you mean he is dead that is just not possible are you sure
8918433 yes maam i am very certain im calling from their house now
8918434 im alright but sandeeps parents are devastated and his mother has had a nervous break down and will need to be hospitalized
8918435 that is understandable but you take it easy im coming over to see you
8918436 no need for that i will come to work from tomorrow
8918437 how can you come to work right away just take some rest and dont worry about work at all
8918438 ive got to come to work as thats the only thing i have to look forward to now i dont feel like staying at home alone
8918439 ok then see you tomorrow and we will talk then
8918440 i hung up worrying about how i could help her in such a situation
8918441 you could just sit inside the office rachna instead of being on the floor
8918442 i prefer to get back to normal as soon as possible
8918443 sandeep did not have a heart attack the post mortem report said it was an over dose of a drug
8918444 mitali could you please send rachna in to my office i need to talk to her she is going to kill herself handling this kind of a pressure
8918445 rachna now please tell me what really happened talking will help lighten your burden and maybe throw a new perspective to things
8918446 i knew sandeep since we were kids we were best buddies after my fathers death since my mother who is a heart patient was worried about my future he decided to get married even before he had a job i started working so early in life when i would have loved to study further to support the two of us i wanted sandeep to study and build a good career
8918447 yes rachna i know you have been such a responsible and dutiful daughter and wife go on please
8918448 late that night sandeep started having strong convulsions and soon collapsed we were watching television when this happened we called the doctor and on his arrival he was declared dead we all thought it was a heart attack after all he loves eating and his cholesterol levels had been on the higher side
8918449 the next day when i was going through his wardrobe drawer which is usually locked i came across quite a few bottles of medicines and some prescription which on checking with the doctor turned out to be fake the post mortem reports also confirmed drug abuse as the cause of his death
8918450 i felt betrayed as if i had come to know after his death that he was having an affair and died in his lovers arms
8918451 why should i mourn for someone who chose to hide something like this from his best friend i knew he had problems at work but couldnt he just speak to me didnt he trust me enough to share his problems what was so acute that he took to drugs how could he betray me like this and leave me alone midstream i will live my life the best i can and not waste it mourning his death
8918452 i know how you must feel rachna i am also feeling a strong surge of anger at someone who could be married to a remarkable courageous woman like you and not have the faith to rely on your strength
8918453 i will not mourn the death of a coward and one who made a choice of death over life i feel really sorry for his parents and will take care of them all my life in fact i will live with them and be their son till they are composed rather than desert them now to live with my mother
8918454 i will always be there for you rachna whenever you need me and you can count on me as you would a sister
8918455 neha dear you need to rest dont touch other clothes and never go into the puja room unless and until i ask you to do so

8918544 i think thats an interesting idea but im not sure if it would be something that would be feasible
8918545 a new anti intellectualism one that meets with broad approval
8918546 mr seeney wants to shaft mine safety spending in queensland its as simple as that
8918547 our levy will boost the safety and health services provided by the states mine safety watchdog the mines inspectorate
8918548 the mines inspectorate provides vital safety and health services that help save lives nothing is more important than that
8918549 with our levy were asking for 26 million from an industry worth 26 billion to queensland in 2006 07
8918550 taxpayers shouldnt have to foot the bill for these vital safety services
8918551 we have the best mine safety legislation in australia and one of the best mine safety records in the world
8918552 its in everyones interests to keep it that way i wouldve thought mr seeney recognised the important of mine safety especially coming from a mining electorate
8918553 weve entered a new era of mining were in boom times when its more important than ever to have a highly skilled and well resourced mines inspectorate
8918554 thats where the levy will go into vital safety services to make mining even safer for the men and women who work in queenslands mines nothing is more important than that
8918555 theyre quite an impressive sight on the road these are over sized loads and people need to take extra care around them
8918556 the overpass requires 18 girders in total six for each span
8918557 the initial six girders will be used on the third span of the overpass and the remaining 12 will arrive in bundaberg in the following months
8918558 the remaining 12 girders for the other two spans are expected to arrive within the next two months
8918559 its a memorable achievement for those involved with the project a sense of satisfaction that its all coming together
8918560 he is under a 15 year dpsoa supervision order with 30 conditions including electronic monitoring and curfew drug and alcohol testing and is also subject to regular surveillance and must submit schedules of his planned and proposed activities on a weekly basis to his probation and parole officer
8918561 the government argued strongly against his release but the supreme court decided otherwise
8918562 queensland corrective services will continue to closely monitor voois and manage him under a strict supervision and surveillance regime
8918563 it is always the governments preference to keep these types of offenders behind bars but when the courts release them they are scrutinised at every turn
8918564 corrective services and the police have a range of supervision tools at their disposal to ensure that these offenders are complying with their supervision orders
8918565 recent amendments to the dangerous prisoners sexual offenders act 2003 meant if voois breaches his order he can be arrested immediately and brought back before the courts
8918566 we have the toughest system in the country for monitoring these types of offenders
8918567 the townsville hospital is under increasing pressure due to a record demand for services
8918568 the situation at townsville hospital is also being exacerbated by a high number of staff on leave
8918569 we have been working to meet demand in the townsville region and are on track to deliver on our commitment of 100 new beds for the hospital
8918570 last year 22 extra hospital beds opened in a brand new unit near the emergency department and the redevelopment will deliver an additional 78 beds
8918571 master planning of the redevelopment is due in october with the project to be completed in 2011
8918572 we have also been busy recruiting staff for the region with a more than 40 percent increase in the medical workforce since 2003
8918573 we face a difficult task in townsville where population growth has only increased nine percent over the past five years but emergency department presentations have increased by 35 percent
8918574 it is a challenge we continue to work with the local health district to address
8918575 it is currently sited at the boyne island environmental education centre and the epa will be discussing future locations at a meeting tonight with the community and industry reference groups
8918576 the mobile station will complement the fixed network as it has the capacity to measure the same full suite of more than 100 potential air pollutants including sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and particles
8918577 the difference is this monitor can be swiftly deployed to different locations depending on the prevailing winds to measure chemicals of concern
8918578 this will give gladstone the most comprehensive air monitoring network anywhere in australia
8918579 the epa is advised that the stranded whale was assisted back into the water and was reported to be alright
8918580 at this time we have no further information available however an epa vessel will patrol the area throughout the day in the unlikely event that the whale restrands
8918581 advice that the whale was able to swim away is good news and we thank those who reported the stranding and were on hand to assist its return to the water
8918582 minke whales are frequent visitors to the great sandy marine park as are large numbers of humpback whales who spend time to socialise in hervey bay on their return south to antarctica at the end of winter
8918583 with whale numbers increasing every year we do expect to see a few strandings along the queensland coast each season
8918584 i remind anyone out in boats jet skis aircraft and in the water that there are regulations regarding how close they can get to whales

8918586 this workshop is an eye opener for businesses that do not have a grasp on their customer service or have a system in place
8918587 after all outstanding customer service is a key component in a business success not only is it economical but the word of mouth generated from good customer service is very effective in attracting customers
8918588 the workshop caters for new business owners who should know how to monitor their financial performance or business operators who want to take control of their finances

8918620 we lack quality coaches in india perhaps they are the best available but they should be sent abroad to familiarise themselves with the latest coaching methods
8918621 what bindra said about lack of coaches in our country is fully correct the fact is that we do not have competent coaches the foreigners are far superior our coaches are just good enough for the beginners
8918622 i support abhinavs comments he is pretty much correct in what he says the biggest problem here is that for events like olympics or world championships you cannot really train under the coaches you have around here
8918623 the extended deadline to eradicate manual scavenging which had been shifted from december 2007 to march 2009 at no cost should be further extended and the country should become manual scavenging free

8918641 but i think it is important that the people of the city region are able to give their views on the proposed investments and the limited charge as soon as possible after the formal consultation defines the final form of our proposals

8918650 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
8918651 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
8918652 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
8918653 we dont foresee any sanctions decided on by the european council
8918654 soon there will be no north or south ossetia there will be a united alania as part of russia

8918665 i offer my warmest congratulations to those athletes from northern ireland who did us proud at the beijing olympics northern ireland has a long and illustrious sporting tradition powerfully contributing to a positive image for northern ireland on the international stage
8918666 particular congratulations must go to medal winners wendy houvenagher and paddy barnes their achievement is a special cause for pride wendys contribution to the fantastic result for team gb also must be mentioned the uk had a great olympics which i trust bodes well for london in 2012
8918667 the deplorable violence in craigavon yesterday taken together with increased violence from republican elements in fermanagh and elsewhere is one more reason for caution over the devolution of policing and justice
8918668 last nights attempt to murder police officers in craigavon amidst the rioting hi jacking and bomb threats are a stark reminder that our society is facing a serious threat from those who remain wedded to violence and hatred
8918669 those who for 3 decades excused the murder of police officers and encouraged riots bear a very heavy political and moral responsibility for last nights events
8918670 amidst the self made crisis of the dup and sinn fein concerning the devolution of policing and justice this policing board report highlights the real issues concerning communities across northern ireland it is on these bread and butter issues of policing that elected representatives should be concentrating their efforts not on spurious arguments that only highlight dup and sinn fein immaturity all politicians have to fully buy into the psni and the rule of law and be prepared to get their hands dirty in order to ensure that all sections of the community gain the confidence needed for devolution to take place district policing partnerships were designed to actively involve local communities in the policing of their local areas and this report adds to that process and should be welcomed however the report highlights that underage drinking burglary and vandalism are still serious concerns for local communities it shows that local communities want prompt responses to emergencies and more police officers on their streets those on the policing board district policing partnerships and all elected representatives in conjunction with the police need to act upon these findings this is the real policing debate
8918671 people within the party recognise that until the stability of the assembly is more firmly established on a longer term basis there will be reluctance among people who are westminster mps to give up their seats to work exclusively in the assembly
8918672 given what the dup has been saying since the last assembly election this is an extraordinary statement what happened to the stability confidence and security which the dup claimed to have brought to the institutions what happened to the fairer better deal
8918673 for the first time in as long as any of us can remember it is republicans and not unionists who are getting the raw end of the deal it is sinn fein who is under pressure
8918674 locally accountable government has been secured on a democratic basis with strong safeguards and full accountability
8918675 unionist interests can be protected through using the devolved institutions to push our own agenda and sabotage theirs
8918676 sinn fein now find themselves trapped inside a unionist majority assembly
8918677 our policy of traditional commonsense unionism is delivering for our community no one can with any credibility deny that is the case
8918678 the days of sinn fein holding the process and the institutions to ransom are gone
8918679 mr robinsons concerns about the stability of the assembly are at total variance with what his colleagues have been saying over recent months
8918680 in addition i intend to work with colleagues in the nio in order to introduce legislative proposals to end the dual mandate of those councillors who are also members of the assembly and or parliament
8918681 the executive committee hasnt been able to meet for almost three months
8918682 firstly a political deal would threaten constitutional democracy in south africa by circumventing the rule of law and the principle of equality before the law without which there is a far greater risk of south africa descending into lawlessness
8918683 secondly a political solution would smash the founding compact of our democracy by elevating the narrow interests of the ancs ruling clique over the sanctity of the constitution democracy can only and ultimately be safeguarded by constitutionalism which recognises that democratic and accountable government must be coupled with constitutional limits on the ruling partys power
8918684 thirdly a political compromise would delegitimise two key institutions of democracy the judiciary and the national prosecuting authority npa a political rather than a legal settlement would make it extremely difficult for the npa to prosecute politically sensitive cases in future
8918685 by sidestepping the courts the authority and legitimacy of the judiciary would be permanently dented and the principle of separation of powers between the legislature the executive and the judiciary would be rendered meaningless
8918686 finally without actually hearing the merits of the fraud and corruption case against zuma and without having seen the charges against him tested in a court of law we will be denied the opportunity to assess on the basis of a court judgement his probity and suitability for public office
8918687 this would set an intolerable benchmark for public life in south africa by paving the way for individuals with grave allegations of public misconduct hanging over their heads to assume office without having to answer their accusers

8918784 i came to the west coast and this became my adopted home its where i began to discover what i wanted to say musically in a more clear fashion than i would have probably been able to in nashville the things that went on out here were outside the mainstream and it allowed me to evolve in a different way
8918785 at the time i was very drawn to the beacon that emmylou harris was acting as in 1976 77
8918786 there was a still flourishing country rock music scene the eagles were at the pinnacle of their success and emmylou had her hot band and was basing it out of southern california that drew me to the west coast
8918787 and there was a great tradition of country music that kept me here even johnny cash lived out here
8918788 so i heard buck really on pop radio first then listened to the stuff on country radio later
8918789 under your spell again that had a magic to it
8918790 the west coast element is what drew me here there was a slightly more raw sound more affinity for rock n roll
8918791 once i got on the west coast the natural thing was using the band you used in the studio onstage and it brought out a visceral quality thats what bucks records had that nashville records didnt carry over into the 60s it was there in the 50s with hank sr s albums but it got lost
8918792 the west coast had more of that jet age interpretation of that a more migratory john steinbeck expression of that you have with buck owens the godfather of country rock because what he was doing in a honky tonk musical setting were the things that converted traditional country music to the rock n roll generation the nashville sound had become more produced in a pop sense and less accessible to a rock audience
8918793 i never felt it was my right to usurp ownership
8918794 i didnt consider covering his songs while he was alive because he was performing them so well until the weekend he died in march 2006 it didnt seem appropriate to do his material
8918795 but only for the remainder of that tour for those few weeks
8918796 i thought i could do something better i was trying to show off
8918797 these guys want to try a little more of everything

8918816 the latest attacks on the largest mech factory the orion which is also a research and development facility were carried out in such a brutal fashion that many injured and fewer more were left dead both clans have denied involvement but one can only speculate on whos behind the attacks since no one has stepped forth and claimed responsibility for them at this time there have been nothing reported stolen or even damage to the assembly line it almost seems like the attacks were nothing more then a test of security

8918852 there have been numerous in vitro and in vivo trials on herbal medicine which have established the benefits of single ingredients such as gingko for vascular dementia
8918853 there is no convincing evidence that ginkgo biloba is efficacious for dementia and cognitive impairment
8918854 the evidence that ginkgo has predictable and clinically significant benefit for people with dementia or cognitive impairment is inconsistent and unconvincing
8918855 we found no evidence that a standard dose of high purity ginkgo biloba confers benefit in mild moderate dementia over six months
8918856 that alternative treatments are touted as though they offer marvelous benefits
8918857 uninterested in determining the safety and efficacy of their interventions
8918858 chiropractors who manipulate the neck can cause a stroke some herbs can cause adverse reactions or can interfere with conventional drugs
8918859 homeopathic remedies which of course contain no active ingredient can be dangerous if they delay or replace a more orthodox treatment
8918860 the worst therapy encountered so far it is an implausible therapy that has failed to prove itself after two centuries and some 200 clinical studies
8918861 alternative medicine is not so much about the treatments we discuss in this book
8918862 but about the therapeutic relationship many alternative practitioners develop an excellent relationship with their patients that helps to maximize the placebo effect of an otherwise useless treatment
8918863 instead of meaningful commitments to closing the gap we saw a sudden sweeping intervention in the northern territory at the tail end of the howard government

8918939 the crucial variable is sizes of state class structure and revenue resources controllers of small political units typically have to take much more interest for better or worse in overseas trade than do rulers with large peasant population that can be taxed relatively easily
8918940 the crucial point is that all of these asian empires prospered not by compulsion but by providing facilities for trade freely undertaken by a vast array of merchants what the rulers provided was really opportunities fair treatment an infrastructure within which trade could take place
8918941 both portugal and spain became in effect conveyor belts that transported spices and bullion to europe and then sent them on to the north and east in portugal empire did not lead to internal economic change royal power was too great so that a nascent bourgeoisie was unable to flourish it seems clear that spanish mercantile groups did better than in portugal but they still not do nearly well enough
8918942 could have done better by using the cost advantages of the cape route to undercut the traditional trade with europe by purely economic means

8918975 quieren responsabilizar al padre de la falta de acogida del presidente en paraguay parece que hay una envidia por el nivel de reconocimiento que tiene el poeta y que lo va a seguir teniendo esto evidencia que seguimos en camino hacia el autoritarismo en el r gimen m s intolerante que ha habido desde somoza porque la consigna es est s conmigo o contra m

8919062 this attack feels a bit different to the 2005 one but i think it has a bit more pace to it ninety miles an hour is difficult to face i have been asked whether i was surprised at the way south africa capitulated but i wasnt really not when broady got the first four or five out with the firepower we had after that i would have backed us to bowl anybody out for 80
8919063 the core of fast bowlers available now is exciting if we can keep the four that bowled this week fit and add ryan sidebottom to that he has been englands best bowler in the past 14 months and he has got to come back somewhere hopefully we can get a group of batters too a steady couple of wicket keepers and then we will have a strong squad going to india and the west indies this winter and we can come back with some confidence for next summers ashes
8919064 i cried my eyelashes off i think its the most powerful thing i have ever experienced
8919065 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
8919066 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
8919067 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
8919068 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
8919069 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
8919070 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
8919071 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
8919072 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
8919073 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
8919074 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
8919075 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
8919076 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
8919077 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
8919078 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
8919079 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
8919080 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
8919081 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
8919082 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
8919083 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
8919084 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
8919085 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
8919086 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
8919087 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
8919088 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
8919089 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
8919090 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
8919091 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
8919092 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
8919093 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
8919094 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
8919095 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
8919096 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
8919097 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
8919098 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness

8919123 writings not rocket science its a helluva lot harder because once you learn all that rocket science crap you can at least in theory build a rocket on the other hand you can read every writing book known to man and attend classes and work with critique partners and get pages of editorial input and still end up with a book that doesnt quite hit the high notes scary but true

8919129 america is now wholly given over to a d d mob of scribbling women and i should have no chance of success while the public taste is occupied with their trash and should be ashamed of myself if i did succeed what is the mystery of these innumberable editions of the lamplighter by maria susanna cummins and other books neither better nor worse worse they could not be and better they need not be when they sell by the hundred thousand
8919130 as for my next book i am going to hold myself from writing it till i have it impending in me grown heavy in my mind like a ripe pear pendant gravid asking to be cut or it will fall
8919131 the storyteller is deep inside everyone of us the story maker is always with us let us suppose our world is attacked by war by the horrors that we all of us easily imagine let us suppose floods wash through our cities the seas rise but the storyteller will be there for it is our imaginations which shape us keep us create us for good and for ill it is our stories that will recreate us when we are torn hurt even destroyed it is the storyteller the dream maker the myth maker that is our phoenix that represents us at our best and at our most creative

8919154 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under five million dollars a year

8919159 while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 i stood up and opposed this war knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face

8919174 we talked about the possibility of a fourth race early on but we felt like we had a finite amount of great ideas and wanted to make sure we focused all the cool best ideas on the existing three races rather than diluting those ideas across four races

8919204 i dont think we should be afraid of isolation i dont believe that isolation is really looming i think we are not in for any freezing in our relations
8919205 in dealing with russia you have to be tough and rough
8919206 the claim alleging that russias decision questions its commitments to peace and security in the caucasus does not stand up to examination
8919207 russia confirms its disposition to constructive interaction within the framework of the g8 group
8919208 the president has made it clear several times until now america was russias advocate when it came to integrating the country into the global community
8919209 we included russia in the group of eight g8 leading industrialised nations we welcomed and pushed forward russias desire to join the world trade organisation that is all at risk now
8919210 in this crisis situation we cant start taking options off the table the russian government now needs to think about what its interests are
8919211 we propose continuing negotiations within the framework of the working group on wto accession but informing our partners of the need to exit some agreements which currently oppose the interests of the russian federation
8919212 we dont feel or see any advantages from membership if they exist at all but we are carrying the burden
8919213 a country that was emboldened to roll over georgia and rip off its territory is not going to get frightened by the wto or the g8 they are past that now

8919223 we cannot fold our hands and look for excuses united are a good side and they proved themselves by winning the league last season but we have to try and make things happen tomorrow we have to make the best out of this situation
8919224 it is absolutely important that we get off on a winning start
8919225 that first game of the season is always crucial and i am sure all the sides are thinking the same thing i really sympathise with free state stars because we will come at them with guns blazing

8919239 i would question why boys are not included in this programme as it is after all a sexually transmitted disease which can lead to the cancer
8919240 males can be considered the vehicle for the transmission of these viruses with the population it is not known yet how long the vaccine will protect even with the use of booster jabs protection may wane after ten years or so
8919241 by not vaccinating boys we are potentially leaving a pool of infected individuals who could spread the viruses to women later
8919242 in addition to the two strains strongly linked to cervical cancer there are other hpvs associated with sexual diseases notably hpv6 and 11
8919243 the vaccine chosen by the government does not protect against these yet there is a vaccine called gardasil that will protect against all four viruses
8919244 it is part of a wider message about sexual health but most importantly it is an anti cancer jag

8919249 it had got to the point when we had to decide if we were going to take it seriously or not
8919250 wed been playing around aberdeen for a couple of years and it really was all or nothing at that point
8919251 it was either use our grades and go to university and pack in the band or see how far we could take it
8919252 the music scene in aberdeen is pretty good but why would an a amp r man go anywhere past glasgow or anywhere past london for that matter
8919253 having decided to take the band seriously we moved to brighton because we didnt really fancy going to london
8919254 in that time our original drummer had left the band but we met tom through friends in brighton and he joined us
8919255 we had the novelty of getting riders for the first time on our last tour
8919256 there was free food and booze and you tend to run with it and go too far by getting drunk every night but the novelty wears off after a couple of shows by which point youre feeling like s and youre playing like s and its absolutely not worth it
8919257 we do like to go to aftershows as long as theres free wine and books
8919258 it was quite hard to get people along to gigs when played in edinburgh in the past

8919261 ou seja pessoas que nunca fumaram e conviveram ou no trabalho ou em casa com pelo menos um fumante
8919262 o correto seria que a pessoa sa sse de casa e fosse fumar em lugar aberto
8919263 v rios estudos j provaram que n o existe um sistema de circula o que limpe a rea e n o tem como isolar porque a fuma a n o vai respeitar esses crit rios

8919265 eu acho que uma quest o de educa o de mudan a de comportamento

8919285 i dont like instant replay because i dont like all the delays i think it sometimes creates as many problems or more than it solves
8919286 but i am willing to say well at least talk about these if people want to talk about it im going to let the general managers discuss it let them come back and make recommendations no im not a big advocate of instant replay
8919287 he seemed to be softer at least on the consideration of the subject
8919288 i dont think it will come up the general managers took an advisory vote nothings been sent on to the commissioner yet when he gets it im confident he will look at it and decide what the next steps are to take but there will be no action theres no action to take
8919289 ive had conversations with the commissioner about it and i know hes giving it a lot of thought and consideration and doing a lot of work on it commissioner selig is getting a lot more information and will know the pros and cons
8919290 i think its certainly something that bares exploring and i look forward to hearing the results
8919291 you have those things that happened this week in houston or yankee stadium and those things just should not happen
8919292 what we need is stuff installed and what we need is people to make sure its going to work and what we need is for the umpires to understand the protocol what we need is to make sure that everyone whos participating understands it
8919293 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
8919294 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
8919295 we reached an agreement final decision with respect to moving ahead has not been made yet but we have an agreement with the umpire
8919296 were going to move forward with the understanding the sides will come to the table later and iron out some of the remaining issues
8919297 we are pleased that we were able to reach this agreement following the world series the players will review the matter and then determine what course to take for the future while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success
8919298 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8919299 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8919300 historically pulp has moved ahead of paper prices but has often set the direction if pulp prices fall because an easing in the global economy it follows that paper demand is typically weak and pricing power for paper makers is limited

8919302 i believe in his ideals and his proposals to lead this nation
8919303 put this in the news headline fat joe says daddy yankee is a sellout
8919304 just like that i gotta go in im talking to little cousins that like yankee and all that and theyre starting to believe that john mccain is the best candidate i cant have that
8919305 i opened the newspaper and got sick to my stomach
8919306 i felt like i wanted to vomit when i seen that the reason why i called him a sellout is because i feel he did that for a publicity look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him how could you want john mccain in office when george bush and the republicans already have half a million people losing their homes in foreclosure were fighting an unjust war its the latinos and black kids up in the frontlines fighting that war we over here trying to take the troops out of iraq and bring peace this guy immediately wants war if not with iraq or afghanistan hell start a new one with iran i feel real disgusted that daddy yankee would do that either he did that for a look or hes just not educated on politics
8919307 if he believes john mccain is the better candidate for the latinos
8919308 we could sit down even if he wants to get into a debate we can debate anywhere new york puerto rico
8919309 the mere fact that youve got a legal system that allows for a complaint which is maybe wrong doesnt in itself invalidate the system if somebody tries to hit you with a chair you dont blame the chair
8919310 animal studies have indicated for years that msg might be associated with weight gain
8919311 ours is the first study to show a link between msg use and weight in humans
8919312 second human studies where msg was added to the diet have failed to show changes in body weight and third a recently published rat study suggests that msg in the diet actually suppresses body weight
8919313 we found that prevalence of overweight was significantly higher in msg users than in non users
8919314 we saw this risk even when we controlled for physical activity total calorie intake and other possible explanations for the difference in body mass the positive associations between msg intake and overweight were consistent with data from animal studies
8919315 in the he et al study the average bmi among non msg users versus the highest quartile of estimated msg use was 22 3 versus 23 5 given this small difference the imprecise methods by which msg intake was estimated and controlled human studies that directly conflict with the results of this report the glutamate association statement strongly questions the broad extrapolation made by the authors
8919316 numerous regulatory authorities and expert bodies including fao who fda health canada efsa and fsanz all have concluded that msg is safe for use as an ingredient in foods

8919318 while organic growth remains strong in food ingredients usa and nutritionals the performance of food ingredients ireland in the second half will be reduced relative to the second half of 2007 as global dairy market volatility has created a time lag in balancing input costs and market returns

8919325 in the carbonated product the carbonation itself is an active ingredient because it helps keep the fish oils fresh by fighting oxidsation
8919326 the challenge with high dose products is keeping the fish oils fresh and this product does that
8919327 being able to extend the shelf life of fresh produce even for just two or three days is extremely valuable not only for producers retailers and consumers but also for the environment
8919328 the advances we have achieved in polymer technology by developing propafresh p2g amp p2gaf mean we are able to work with the majority of players in the fruit and vegetable arena to ensure the absolute optimum in pack conditions for their products
8919329 delivering improved shelf life is also key to reducing food waste and fits in with the waste amp resources action programme wrap s love food hate waste campaign which recommends consumers keep prepared fresh produce in the original packaging and refrigerate

8919339 the normal way in which youd make a shoe waterproof is put a membrane inside the shoe gore tex is a well known example
8919340 thats effectively putting a plastic bag inside the shoe no water gets inside your shoe but at the same time that reduces the breathability both in terms of sweat and of heat escaping
8919341 the results presented here demonstrate that the addition of colourless rose petal polyphenols acting as co pigments significantly reduces the thermal degradation of strawberry in model solutions thus bringing about enhanced colour stability even at a molar pigment co pigment ratio of 1 2
8919342 in contrast to the addition of rosemary and thyme extracts which have been used as anthocyanin stabilizing agents at a 1 100 c opigmentation ratio rose petal polyphenols are effective at much lower concentrations thus allowing an economically viable stabilization method
8919343 therefore the substitution of synthetic food colorants by their natural counterparts and the development of methods to stabilize natural pigments are of utmost importance to meet consumer demands for safer and healthier food
8919344 the results obtained demonstrate that the addition of rose petal polyphenols slows the thermal degradation of strawberry anthocyanins thus resulting in improved colour retention without affecting the gustatory quality of the product

8919354 for too long credit card companies have been using unfair and deceptive practices to trick americans into signing agreements they cant afford
8919355 credit card issuers were going to face an uphill battle if obama won regardless of the vice presidential choice
8919356 our point is that biden is unlikely to moderate obamas approach to credit card legislation as vice president whereas he could have been a moderating influence on credit card legislation if he had remained in the senate
8919357 to us that means this selection is a negative for the credit card issuers
8919358 visa mastercard and amex so does the american bankers association they will be able to make their case
8919359 joe biden represents the state of delaware where the credit card companies are a major industry so joe biden voted in a way that was overwhelmingly popular in his state and barack obama didnt thats a story

8919363 all of us want peace but peace at what price
8919364 what is so sacred with these prior agreements that cannot be derogated

8919366 oh you can do the vacuuming and unpack those books and tidy up over here and finish the laundry and clean the pool
8919367 it thrilled my heart to see them pray to receive christ
8919368 wed been sitting there visiting all morning going through the tract and for the first time they saw the scripture in their own language we established a bond and now we are sisters in christ
8919369 we planned everything so that we could retire at 55 to do volunteer missions
8919370 we actually thought at first god wanted us to go as full time missionaries through the foreign mission board now international mission board but he showed us quickly that was not to be the case instead he was calling us to serve through short term missions
8919371 i am fully convinced that every person created by god should have the opportunity to hear the gospel and respond yes or no
8919372 in order to do that someone has to go and tell we are simply trying to be obedient to what the lord has called us to do
8919373 i confess that when i first saw mussa and the mama i did not think they were going to make it well
8919374 but they did and they were a testimony to the people one older man said he could not come to the gathering to hear the gospel preached and then he saw the mama walking from hut to hut sharing the gospel and he got up and went one day we all stopped for lunch but the mussa never came back to eat he kept sharing the gospel this is a great example to us
8919375 it has been awesome to be on this trip and to share this experience with them they have such a love for the lord and ive learned a lot just being with them papaw always has some word of wisdom hes sharing with me
8919376 i would say to retired people dont retire just move on to what god has called you to do next
8919377 if you are still living and breathing you are a missionary you dont have to go overseas to be a missionary but if you do god will provide the resources and if he calls go dont hesitate go do it
8919378 it is good for them to help players learn english when i learned english i became a better player but to suspend them i dont think so
8919379 this is going to be perfectly splendid that old chap will let us do anything we like
8919380 and who are you to say when im to go to bed go to bed yourself
8919381 theres sure to be a row if were heard talking here
8919382 i tell you this is the sort of house where no ones going to mind what we do anyway they wont hear us its about ten minutes walk from here down to that dining room and any amount of stairs and passages in between
8919383 this is going to be a wonderful place for birds i shall go to bed now i say lets go and explore tomorrow you might find anything in a place like this did you see those mountains as we came along and the woods there might be eagles there might be stags therell be hawks

8919437 ive watched lots of nfl teams and nba teams talked to some coaches and ive found a common thread there that will benefit us
8919438 its basically doing what you do process who we are making sure that you dont change the recipe on a team thats had success not only in one year but in many years thats where were at
8919439 i hear people talking about it but im not worried
8919440 ive seen what these guys can do i trust them
8919441 any time you bring a new starter to the mix its imperative that the strength of the offense help that quarterback
8919442 one of the strengths certainly is the offensive line i like the idea that the running backs are veteran the tight end is veteran the full back and the receivers are veteran
8919443 one of the first patrols we went on was to go assess this pool
8919444 our contractor didnt want to drain the pool completely when kids are still using it so he was able to set it up so the kids could swim while construction was going on they were working 24 hours a day on the project
8919445 the perfect end state would be that the project becomes self sufficient it doesnt require any american influence to be able to continue
8919446 we want the community to have the ability to experience a part of childhood that every kid should have

8919450 every non league manager up and down the country would be lying if they said they didnt want to get into the first round of the fa cup and im no different
8919451 theres always one team the equivalent of clitheroe which gets into the first round with all the publicity and cash that goes with it i would love to have the match of the day cameras down at shawbridge
8919452 that might seem a bit of a dream and a long way off but we are sending a strong squad up to penrith to try and get into the next round
8919453 it will be a tough game for us but if we do the right things like we have in the last three games im sure we can come away with a result
8919454 we felt they were goals we couldnt score last year the ones that were breaking off the goalkeeper two yards out for the tap in
8919455 those goals are probably the bread and butter the fantastic goal that you saw with the good play for the first goal on tuesday night they dont come up every week so we sometimes just need the scrappy sloppy goals for somebody to put the ball in from two or three yards out
8919456 i think martins hard work and his energy makes that happen for him
8919457 hes probably a defenders nightmare because hes always there and round about and you cant take your eye off him for a minute
8919458 its a great thing for us to have and long may it continue
8919459 weve had three clean sheets in the first five games of the season which would be good reading for anybody but obviously the four goals that we shipped at sheffield wednesday and the three here although a lot of them were unfortunate it wasnt acceptable and we couldnt let it go on
8919460 we worked on a change of system at training the players are probably bored to death with it but it was something we felt we had to work on a lot
8919461 it needed an improvement and i think weve seen that but its a lot of hard hours on the training ground thats made that happen
8919462 weve been working on the back four and the team shape as a whole not that we hadnt been doing but obviously putting a lot more emphasis on it to make sure the mistakes that happened against ipswich and sheffield wednesday werent going to happen again
8919463 we felt we were a wee bit thin on the ground in defence as far as injuries suspension or form could go so russell definitely gives us options for tomorrow
8919464 we need points on the board to go with the two recent performances i dont think theres any doubt about that especially after whats gone before
8919465 people would ask me what it was like to go to a certain place and id say well i know about the hilton and the arena
8919466 and no offence but arenas are all kind of the same
8919467 i always struggled with the question whats your favourite place to perform in so id have to say well my favourite time was when i wrestled here but it was mostly because of the match not necessarily the place
8919468 initially we set out to do an adventure activity show and the fact i was willing to do all these cool things that was the first idea
8919469 but then it kind of evolved into something slightly different because once we got to these places we realized these activities mean something really special in these cultures so i was pleased to make it a deeper show
8919470 it would have been a neat show just seeing me run around and do fun things but to actually be able to include a lot of interesting information about how the warriors of yesteryear used these techniques or things like that it makes it richer
8919471 im absolutely blessed i still ask sometimes this is a job
8919472 the mv concept for this was set as park jung ah missing kim dong wan hurt ga in remembrance tae yeon sadness sun ye promise etc with different feelings for each scene setting they all did a marvellous job for the crying scenes and the four girls were so emotional that they couldnt stop crying even after the cameras had stopped rolling

8919480 masyarakat mungkin tidak akan pernah lupa terhadap kejadian fenomenal semburan lumpur yang terjadi di wilayah jawa timur itu bahkan setelah dua tahun lumpur sidoarjo terus menyembur tanpa henti
8919481 kejadian ini sebenarnya sangat alami bahkan beberapa pakar telah memetakan indonesia sebagai wilayah yang rentan terhadap gangguan alam seperti itu
8919482 kubah sangiran kemudian tererosi pada bagian puncaknya sehingga membentuk sebuah depresi pada depresi itulah tersingkap lapisan lapisan tanah secara alamiah
8919483 artinya kejadian itu bisa terulang kembali jika beban di atas permukaan tanah di beberapa wilayah di pulau jawa terlalu berat misalnya oleh kepadatan kota
8919484 kurangnya pengetahuan pemerintah dan masyarakat mengenai geologi diduga sebagai penyebab awal terjadinya bencana pemerintah memberikan izin eksplorasi dan masyarakat melaksanakannya tanpa berbekal pengetahunan geologi
8919485 ini memang unik di wilayah yang termasuk jalur gunung lumpur itu ternyata terkandung minyak yang cukup besar kondisi ini mirip dengan kejadian pengeboran minyak di wilayah azerbaijan dan iran
8919486 pada dasarnya pengebor itu tidak salah karena wilayah itu mengandung minyak permasalahan utamanya ialah masih rendahnya kesadaran terhadap kelestarian lingkungan sebagai basis pembangunan
8919487 esses fatores n o comprometeram de forma brutal a renda mas permitiram a acomoda o do crescimento

8919517 the secret behind the devastating swing bowling that took england to its historic 2005 ashes win has been revealed they cheated
8919518 former england batsman marcus trescothick has admitted to illegally shining the ball during the 2005 ashes series
8919519 a hint of mint made them kings of swing englands amazing 2005 ashes victory may have been orchestrated by peppermint sweets with former batsman marcus trescothick revealing that he shone the ball by sucking on the breath fresheners with breathtaking results
8919520 i actually wish marcus put a bit more mint on the ball so it deflected further off my glove were talking about sugar coating using mints there are a lot more major issues in the game at the moment to worry about
8919521 as trescothicks autobiography makes quite clear the mischief with the murray mints did not happen in 2005 but during the ashes summer of 2001 england lost that series 4 1 proving that when it comes to cheating we suck
8919522 the champions trophy will be held in pakistan and there are no chances of shifting the event from pakistan to any other country if the icc shifts the champions trophy to any other venue pakistan will pull out from the event
8919523 we are firmly behind pakistan i think it all depends on pakistan and what they have to say on the security issue if pakistan says the country is safe to play in and the tournament can be held on schedule they have our support
8919524 we have firmly backed pakistan to host the tournament however we have no problem with the tournament being shifted to sri lanka either
8919525 i dont think we need to beg countries to play against us especially during ramadan

8919532 wer die fachmagazine liest der bekommt ja wirklich den eindruck dass da drau en f r den kunden die gesamte netzinfrastruktur steht und wir k nnen jetzt eigentlich mit mobile tv aber auch mit mobile internet und mobile video kommen aber das stimmt nat rlich einfach nicht denn ber die netze hinweg in deutschland haben wir als anbieter von inhalten nat rlich schon sehr starke serviceunterschiede
8919533 studiert man das kleingedruckte vermeintlicher flatrate angebote der betreiber so findet man dort in viele f llen limitierungen im datenvolumen bei deren berschreiten entweder die kosten exponentiell ansteigen oder in anderen f llen die nutzungsbandbreite reduziert wird
8919534 gleiches gilt f r datenverbindungen im ausland bei denen exorbitante kosten entstehen k nnen wenn man beispielsweise im auslandsnetz vergisst die regelm ige synchronisation zu deaktivieren und im rhythmus von f nf minuten f r jede einzelnen verbindungsaufbau kr ftig zur kasse gebeten wird mit einer derartigen preispolitik werden die wachstumsphantasien der netzbetreiber sicherlich nicht aufgehen

8919608 the first one we showed was dirty harry because the name of the artists exhibition on view was harry callahan animal house doesnt tie in with the current exhibition so much as it does the start of the new school year we were concerned about not having a big turnout for harold and maude shown in february to coincide with valentines day but apparently it has a huge cult following 350 people showed up people were wild about that movie
8919609 i would define a cult film as a film that speaks to a persons inner child
8919610 a fan of cult films can look past things like absurd story lines horrible acting unnecessary musical numbers strange camera gyrations fake guts and still see a precious gem in cinematic history
8919611 cult can also indicate schlock or films that were so bad theyre entertaining
8919612 when pink flamingos opened i was so young that i didnt know what a transvestite was i thought divine was just a fat chick i was so taken by the depravity and honesty and crazed originality that for one year i went to see it every weekend
8919613 when they brought that back i saw it four or five times i wanted to see how it would look digitally projected enhanced at the cineramadome i love that movie
8919614 ben hur is not a cult film in most cases i think that if a film becomes so big that everybody sees it it tends to lose some of the originality that may have contributed to its cult status
8919615 films that you probably never see on a cult film list are daddy day care high school musical daredevil and the mummy
8919616 i just cant imagine people dressing up as concentration camp guards and standing in line
8919617 the models for this event will be members of san diego burlesque troupe a bit o burlesque
8919618 the models have been asked to improvise on the drunken frat party theme i expect some slightly naughty fun
8919619 if they really wanted to capture the spirit of the film

8919622 in entertainment games are the equal of the film and television industry and growth is strong but now the japanese game industry isnt leading with the same vigor that it did previously this is a worldwide battle
8919623 to either be affiliated and losing the brand or possibly merging with taito thats the big difference
8919624 while it looks like the games are made by a single talented genius games are made by teams
8919625 i dont know anything of the concrete details of this particular case
8919626 but even if we accept a new museum was needed it should be in a style close to that of the ancient buildings
8919627 we will just sing three hymns it wont be a big ceremony
8919628 i dont know how many of us will be there people are afraid the fact is that we are subject to religious persecution
8919629 no matter what im talking about i have to bring up killer tomatoes because it just brings a smile to peoples faces and thats the most fun of the whole thing
8919630 we literally made the movie from the title because it was so rich
8919631 suddenly people got it it was the spoof of spoofs
8919632 it created a cult following and its been fun ever since
8919633 what john was able to do here was sort of prep the region for what was to come
8919634 im excited to see what a new generation can do with the concept and the ideas
8919635 there were people from all over the country and its just a kick
8919636 johns been successful because he understands how that marketing works
8919637 those people who enjoyed that genre have been true and loyal to it
8919638 the spoof has changed dramatically its a genre unto itself
8919639 i think personally i got more of a kick out of doing something where theres a lot of subtext
8919640 it strikes a chord with certain people and i think thats a reason for its longevity
8919641 the killer tomatoes concept pokes fun at everything its an equal opportunity offender
8919642 its not aimed in any particular direction its a great palette to paint on because its so broad in terms of its humor
8919643 its not always the focus of your life but its always in the background
8919644 you try and go out and do something fun and its gratifying that people enjoy it
8919645 i view this deliberate attempt to subvert the executive as an act of the utmost bad faith
8919646 aside from the fact that peter robinson has no authority to write any letter on any subject on behalf of ofm dfm without the agreement of sinn fein people will be amazed that at a time when there are real outstanding issues to resolve mr robinson has the time to play petty politics
8919647 the pattern seems to be jim allister raises an issue and it becomes a dup priority it is weak politics and no way to do business
8919648 the strategy which you have published is not the strategy which was agreed by the executive on 10 april i have sought and received legal advice on this and consider you to be in clear breach of your ministerial duties and that you have acted unlawfully
8919649 i would be grateful for an urgent response from you setting out the steps required to rectify this situation
8919650 if we cannot trust colleagues to take forward a decision agreed by the executive then this is a very worrying and dangerous situation
8919651 in these circumstances i am also seeking an urgent meeting of the executive as soon as possible to discuss this important matter it may be that the executive can resolve the situation without recourse to the high court
8919652 the regional development strategy produced by drd is an accurate reflection of what was agreed at executive level it would suit mr robinson better if he used his time engaging in the process of intensive dialogue he committed his party to in june to sort out serious issues
8919653 the total number of individuals nonsuited is 253 including the 26 disputed minors
8919654 the nonsuits are part of the process as we continue to work through the cases the investigation continues and those findings we have yet to announce
8919655 the lawsuits are in a different category were nonsuiting those as we work through them
8919656 the foster parents i am with are nice amp treat me well
8919657 nothing is the same as home but pretty soon i will be with you which is the happiest place to be
8919658 may our loving heavenly father hear our fervant prayers and comfort us i know he is doing it and will allow us to be together once again
8919659 he will make things so bad for white people that hopefully they will finally realize how stupid they were for admiring these jigaboos all these years
8919660 i believe in the motto worse is better and obama certainly fits that description
8919661 i hope obama wins because in four years white people just might be pissed off enough to actually do something white people arent going to do a thing until their toys are taken away from them so things have to be worse for things to be better
8919662 i am gleefully sadistically looking forward to obama as president it will be a beautiful day when the masses look at the paper and truly realize they have lost their own country
8919663 to the average white man and woman they could look at obama and see plain as day that whites are not in control
8919664 could it be that the nomination of obama finally sparks a sense of unity in white voters i would propose that this threat of black muslim sic rule may very well be the thing that finally scares some sense back into complacent whites throughout the nation
8919665 if obama were to win it would be the best thing that ever happened to the klan they would have massive growth
8919666 a whole bunch of people will join us and find these boards
8919667 obama will be a signal a clear signal for millions of our people
8919668 obama is like that new big dark spot on your arm that finally sends you to the doctor for some real medicine obama is the pain that lets sic your body know that something is dreadfully wrong obama will let the american people know that there is a real cancer eating away at the heart of our country and republican aspirin will not only not cure it but only masks the pain and makes you think you dont need radical surgery my bet is that whether obama wins or loses in november millions of european americans will inevitably react with new awareness of their heritage and the need for them to defend and advance it
8919669 the uprising of the american people for majority rule and real democracy has been building but with obama turning the white house into the black house the upheaval will be overpowering
8919670 the cataclysm will wake people up and the despotism will drive people to act as never before
8919671 as wlp william luther pierce the late leader of the neo nazi national alliance would say what is bad for the system is good for us
8919672 would be better for our cause in the long run no doubt about it
8919673 better a black who is honest about who he is than a conservative who is really delivering the liberal agenda
8919674 i think hes got the right touch absolutely the right touch hes an intelligent and serious man and he realizes that he cannot be a black president
8919675 for many whites voting for mr obama will be an act of high patriotism electing him will prove america is not racist and many whites believe that rising above racism is americas sacred calling one must never underestimate the importance to whites of feeling virtuous
8919676 white people are faced with either a negro or a total nutter who happens to have a pale face personally id prefer the negro national socialists are not mindless haters here i see a white man who is almost dead who declares he wants to fight endless wars around the globe to make the world safe for judeo capitalist exploitation who supports the invasion of america by illegals then we have a black man who loves his own kind belongs to a black nationalist religion is married to a black woman thats the kind of negro that i can respect
8919677 worse is not better it has already hit rock bottom the next step is to round up all the whites and put them in concentration camps
8919678 if you are in the same camp as i am i will slap you for suggesting that we vote for obama
8919679 obama as president would do tremendous damage to the cause of maintaining the purity of the white race liberals would use him as an example to argue in schools in churches on tv etc why if your daughter married a black her child could one day grow up to become president like obama
8919680 we are not going to vote our way out of this mess
8919681 well we all know what happened to the old jfk i just hope it happens in the timing of rfk before he can take office
8919682 im hoping someone will do his public duty of putting a bullet through obamas head
8919683 attention if obama becomes presedant sic i will kill him myself make no mistake about it
8919684 rubbish rumours of renewing wedding vows i think once was enough and ive just paid out on a big party for her birthday
8919685 i bought her two original hermes drawings of equestrian thingies sic but trust me the party was infinitely more expensive than the paintings
8919686 ill back him up you want to fight a girl bring it on ill do it
8919687 the nats are still within striking distance in the wild card chase
8919688 dru yogas affiliation was refused as they are associated with the life foundation an organisation based in bethesda which allegedly engages in cult practice
8919689 we have been concerned about the activities of the life foundation for many years
8919690 i have received lots of calls from people concerned about the group many of whom are ex members
8919691 the concerns i have regarding this group are the same as those i have about much larger groups such as the moonies
8919692 some of the allegations go back some time and some go back to a couple of years ago
8919693 we contacted bangor university and the people we spoke to gave us no reason to be concerned
8919694 there is a reasonable small residential community scattered in the school and none of those people said they were concerned at anything the group was doing
8919695 i need to be able to talk to everybody but so far the feedback ive had about them has been okay
8919696 several people who were involved with us went their own way and as a result started making some outrageous stories out what we do
8919697 it is essentially people who have been disaffected from their experience
8919698 when people come and work with you they have their own issues
8919699 investigators have assumed that asthma is not a complication of pediatric hiv infection
8919700 it was not until the era of haart which restored the t cell levels that an increased incidence of asthma was noted
8919701 the large and growing unmet need for pediatric hiv aids services demonstrates that failure of our pmtct programs to avert parent to child transmission of hiv
8919702 if we prevent hiv infection in children then we do not need to take care of them when they are infected
8919703 cultural beliefs social stigma ignorance and economic status influenced the mothers attitudes and preference for the different feeding alternatives
8919704 deny their spouses the opportunity to participate in the program
8919705 we have a moral obligation to ensure that our children and grandchildren are born and remain free from hiv aids
8919706 to understand why marginalized populations are at higher risk of infection you have to recognize that these groups often do not have equal access to housing education health care clean drinking water or nutrition
8919707 marginalized groups also face discrimination and have less control of funding streams for health and social welfare purposes
8919708 enjoy rights and a quality of life much higher than do people in other nations
8919709 legal system acknowledges constitutional and civil rights but not human rights
8919710 void when it comes to advocating for the right to quality health care for everyone
8919711 without equal access to quality health care the epidemic will only continue to increase in much of the world
8919712 some societies are busy playing the blame game to avoid taking on their fair share of the systematic responsibility for infections the medical community aids service organizations and human service agencies around the world are in the trenches trying to save lives
8919713 we will never have enough resources to defeat this epidemic if we dont have the support of our communities
8919714 an open content distribution system that will help users find purchase download and install
8919715 at a minimum you can expect support for free unpaid applications
8919716 this settlement marks a new chapter in making web sites accessible to the blind i commend target for committing to being a leader in online accessibility
8919717 the american auto industry is deserving of government loan guarantees
8919718 we figured out how to get the mother of all blood stem cells with the right culture conditions
8919719 there is real hope that in the future we can grow billions of blood cells at will to treat blood related disorders and just as critically if not more so weve got ace as a new old marker to guide our work
8919720 but were very pleasantly surprised to discover it as a beacon for finding the earliest blood stem cells known as well as new ways to find and manipulate this marker to make them grow
8919721 we can make lots and lots of blood cells from human stem cells for transfusions regenerate new vascular trees for heart diseases as well as create test tube factories for making transplantable blood cells that treat diseases we are very far from treatment
8919722 that have roots on the ground and actually reach the people
8919723 we are disappointed by the courts decision and will appeal this ruling
8919724 we believe the patent protecting razadyne is valid and would be infringed by the introduction of a generic galantamine hydrobromide product
8919725 indian people are dying across this country from inadequate health care
8919726 it seems as though they believe a certain number of native american people are expendable
8919727 developed in 1921 and fails to protect most people beyond childhood
8919728 essential to harness the most promising technologies so we can deliver an effective tb vaccine as quickly as possible
8919729 even a rough gauge of hiv incidence is a valuable tool for understanding and combating the spread of hiv
8919730 researchers may be able to discern increases and decreases in hiv incidence over time and target prevention efforts accordingly

8919735 i wish they would do so especially in public because to get fired upon for this would demonstrate more than ever that i must have done something very very right as anyone with common sense would see that the only reason they are in business in the first place is because being overweight as a population only serves to make them even richer and what ive done is going to free masses of people from being slaves to them for good even many millions

8919773 clinton could win the statewide vote but she could still just break even or end up behind in the delegate count
8919774 the press is playing attention to who wins the delegates so that will be important

8919928 to our knowledge this is the first report of a direct association between childhood abuse and asthma and asthma related outcomes
8919929 we wanted to explore whether exposure to stress and violence is associated with an increased risk of asthma in urban children living in puerto rico
8919930 we already know that there is a high prevalence of asthma in puerto rican children and many studies have linked stress and exposure to violence to health problems in childhood including asthma
8919931 children with a history of abuse had higher frequencies of all outcomes of interest than those without a history of abuse
8919932 after adjusting for relevant covariates history of abuse was associated with an approximate doubling of the odds of current asthma healthcare use for asthma and allergic rhinitis
8919933 it is not simply the exposure to a particular stressor but the physiological response to that stressor that predicts physical health outcomes
8919934 latino culture places an emphasis on certain values and social supports that may buffer the effects of poverty and community violence experienced by children in puerto rico
8919935 our findings highlight the importance of both screening for illnesses such as asthma in children who are abused and of being aware of the possibility of abuse in children with asthma
8919936 if present at all was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
8919937 while such a reduction in all cause mortality would have been impressive these mortality benefits are likely implausible previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated a healthy user benefit or frailty bias
8919938 over the last two decades in the united sates even while vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality further only about 10 percent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 percent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion
8919939 the healthy user effect is seen in what doctors often refer to as their good patients patients who are well informed about their health who exercise regularly do not smoke or have quit drink only in moderation watch what they eat come in regularly for health maintenance visits and disease screenings take their medications exactly as prescribed and quite religiously get vaccinated each year so as to stay healthy such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
8919940 but you also need to take care of yourself everyone can reduce their risk by taking simple precautions
8919941 wash your hands avoid sick kids and hospitals during flu season consider antiviral agents for prophylaxis and tell your doctor as soon as you feel unwell because there is still a chance to decrease symptoms and prevent hospitalization if you get sick because flu vaccine is not as effective as people have been thinking it is
