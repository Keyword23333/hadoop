2830057 i need to call my mom and have her tape espn
2830058 hopefully i got on there today with a penalty lap it was weird because its a penalty lap and youre running it because youve done something wrong and people are cheering it was a little different
2830059 you have to get used to a guys voice his placement of his hands how quickly hes getting out you try to make it look as effortless as possible
2830060 i think its kind of funny but yet serves its purpose i think things like that are important in the fact that everyone is involved in it
2830061 when you come out here and the fans are going crazy and having fun it just helps you get through the day
2830062 weve just got to make sure were handling everything around him so we have the chemistry we need to have before the season starts
2830063 the ball comes out hard and fast and straight and long so thats always good

2830076 look i had five dunks in one game thats because of the crowd last time i had five dunks in a game i was like 17 so thats all because of the energy in this crowd
2830077 i think they knew that history was being made tonight and obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it was for ours you could feel the electricity
2830078 it was our first game we were very anxious we missed shots that we normally would hit but at the end of the day you win by almost 30 points youve got to take good things out of that
2830079 we played very very hard we give ourselves a chance defensively every night thats what its all about with us
2830080 we came out a little tight we knew that it was going to be a very emotional game for both teams especially china playing in front of their home crowd

2830095 but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins

2830216 these guys are amazing and this is the best team ive ever seen together just like john force and amatos teams in their time
2830217 its unbelievable not only have we won a lot of races but weve won some of the most difficult races with so much pressure and for whatever reason i feel like i am driving my best right now ive got a great team and a great car and the whole package has come together i dont want to be the weak link in our team so i am working harder than ever when you have the car thats supposed to win thats a lot of pressure
2830218 its great to win by such a large margin when we are not yet 100 percent physically
2830219 you can see they lyon are a great team and its clear we have work to do we let the first goal in from a free kick we should not have given away but the team is young and is likely to improve
2830220 we were hoping that it would not be that close and dramatic
2830221 after the early goal we were hoping we would be able to cruise but we learned a lesson that you cant relax even against a third division team we still have a lot of work ahead of us
2830222 based on the statements by family members that mr hayes had been treated of late for a number of medical issues we believe that led to his death today there are no plans for an autopsy

2830224 it allows us to come out and blow off some steam together collectively as army families but it also shows the families the community supports them
2830225 its harder on them than it is on me especially when i get deployed its just more stressful on them sometimes you cant get to a phone they dont know whats going on
2830226 we keep busy we just go everywhere hang out with people youre never by yourself
2830227 you dont necessarily forget about your family but what you do is you kind of tuck it away in a safe spot for a little while and get on with the mission

2830234 fue en una cancha dif cil y ante un rival muy necesitado por el tema del promedio para empezar un campeonato nada mejor a nosotros nos sirven much simo los tres puntos
2830235 al final sufrimos metieron muchos delanteros y la cuesti n era sacarla de arriba aunque sea con pelotazos pero lo manejamos bien y tuvieron s lo dos situaciones de gol por eso insisto con que el triunfo me pone muy bien porque fue lo m s importante adem s de la actitud que tuvo el equipo que fue una m quina
2830236 en las pr cticas que tuvimos no sali de la mejor manera porque al llegar un t cnico nuevo muchos chicos se quer an mostrar y est bamos todos un poco acelerados por eso quiz s prefiri hacer otra cosa aunque siempre nos dice que hay que apretar arriba y debemos mantener al rival lejos de nuestro arco lo importante fue que en el primer tiempo jugamos m s en el campo del rival que en el nuestro
2830237 tenemos una muy buena defensa m s all de los compa eros que faltaron siempre tratamos de mantener el orden y el cero en nuestro arco que nos dio mucho resultado en la temporada pasada
2830238 depar ansiedad pero por suerte los chicos que los reemplazaron jugaron bien dejaron todo y se vio reflejado en el resultado
2830239 los tres puntos nos sirvieron mucho m s porque en el torneo pasado nos costaba ganar de visitantes pero es s lo la primera fecha y a n falta mucho

2830244 this is a time of total collapse where everything is lost it is the time of the judgement of god there will be epidemics plagues and famine governments will be lost to forgiveness and wise men and prophets will be lost
2830245 a time of misfortune rulers and their subjects separate the people lose faith in their leaders leaders may be harshly treated even hung there is also an abundance of snakes a great famine and few births during this period
2830246 a time of demolition and destruction among the governors an end to the greed but much fighting a time to settle in a new place
2830247 we made a change just before the start of the race and went with a harder front tire
2830248 that allowed me to use the front a little bit more and conserve the rear

2830252 but i wish i was healthier about 10 laps in i could feel the pain in every transition
2830253 i just didnt want to do anything stupid i never actually planned to be on the podium today
2830254 this takes a lot of pressure off us and we can go to the last round and hang it out a little
2830255 i try not to date where i work it makes life easier
2830256 i dont say no to anybody because id hope that people wouldnt say no to me just because im an actor but theyd have to be pretty extraordinary

2830258 sam and lindsay are unbelievably happy and in a healthy relationship

2830260 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2830261 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set when we did oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch everyday and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different that any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore
2830262 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
2830263 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed

2830269 so carol its been forever since ive seen you hows jim what have you been up to lately
2830270 well ive been trying some yoga classes lately and just really taking care of myself jim and i have been redecorating the guest bedroom preparing for our big arrival were just so excited
2830271 you realize im not just fat that im actually 7 months pregnant with twins right

2830275 i mean at your job as a biochemist youve been doing that for what 12 years now wow youre quite committed to that er field
2830276 that she did you a favor and i dont mean that in the way you think i mean
2830277 let me guess youre going to say to me that by sitting next to me she caused me to put out my cigarette which is a step in the right direction because i shouldnt be smoking anyway because cigarettes are nasty and addictive and cause cancer and disease and theyre anti semitic and are responsible for world hunger and whenever i smoke the terrorists win eh or is that what you thought i would think youd mean
2830278 no not at all the favor she did for you was that she gave you the perfect opportunity to exhibit gentlemanly behavior
2830279 by sitting next to you she unwittingly gave you an opportunity to set yourself apart from the rest of the unthinking jerks out there the opportunity to put out your cigarette and be a knight in shining armor even if only you were aware of the sacrifice you made

2830294 but the eurasian balkans are infinitely more important as a potential economic prize an enormous concentration of natural gas and oil reserves is located in the region in addition to important minerals including gold
2830295 it follows that americas primary interest is to help ensure that no single power comes to control this geopolitical space and that the global community has unhindered financial and economic access to it
2830296 two basic steps are thus required first to identify the geostrategically dynamic eurasian states that have the power to cause a potentially important shift in the international distribution of power and to decipher the central external goals of their respective political elites and the likely consequences of their seeking to attain them second to formulate specific u s policies to offset co opt and or control the above
2830297 to put it in a terminology that harkens back to the more brutal age of ancient empires the three grand imperatives of imperial geostrategy are to prevent collusion and maintain security dependence among the vassals to keep tributaries pliant and protected and to keep the barbarians from coming together

2830299 your favourite subjects are gods eternal purposes absolute sovereignty unchangeable love and distinguishing grace and yet you neglect the clearest precepts and most important duties of gods word your life is characterized by pride covetousness anger malice and all kinds of other unholy passions which make you a scandal to christianity and cause the godly to be sorrowful what a grievous condition to be in you may argue with others in seeking to vindicate divine sovereignty but it will do no good either to others or yourself it is clear that you are an enemy in your heart and a rebel in your life against the sovereign god whose rights you claim to uphold by neglecting his precepts and transgressing his laws you virtually deny his absolute authority and renounce his supreme dominion you obey the law of your own sinful lusts and pursue worldly pleasure you do not love your maker and lord neither do you serve him may that omnipotent sovereign grace which you talk about without experiencing it deliver and save your soul truly it would be hard to find a more disgusting character outside of hell than you

2830303 some situations take courageous decisions with regard to the political future
2830304 sometimes there are democratically elected or semi democratically elected leaders who do things which create grave problems for their countries
2830305 so sometimes those leaders should contemplate how useful they have become to their people
2830306 for me it confirms that what the russian federation is seeking through this military aggression and invasion is to change the democratically elected georgian government
2830307 the days of overthrowing leaders by military means in europe those days are gone
2830308 this statement ambassador is absolutely unacceptable particularly from the lips of the permanent representative of a country whose actions we are aware of including with regard to civilian populations in iraq and afghanistan and serbia

2830315 well we are letterboxers and there is a letterbox hidden here are you familiar with letterboxing sir
2830316 a version of this article appeared in print on august 10 2008 on page ar1 of the new york edition
2830317 especially in that 24 hours my first nfl game big game it was my birthday and then i had a baby on my birthday it was all in 24 hours it was a good couple of days
2830318 i was going straight to the hospital i took the team flight back we got to the complex around 3 30 in the morning and i got to the hospital around 4 she arrived later that night
2830319 the stats on the baby seven pounds three ounces 20 inches
2830320 born 8 08 08 at 9 04 p m my birthday too its pretty sweet
2830321 the first play we were just watching the safeties seeing how they were biting down
2830322 we did play action and clowney is just as fast as fast can be the safeties came down a little bit on the run he beat them over the top and i put it out there and let him run
2830323 it was kind of watching the safety david got outside i put it out to him again and he was able to get it again and go down the sideline
2830324 you saw the physical attributes hes got size a strong arm and hes a smart guy
2830325 that quarterback room sets a pretty high bar for work ethic and hes right there with them hes impressive in terms of just continually absorbing the chunks of information and getting better the guy thats here now versus the guy that was here a year ago its night and day
2830326 im definitely trying to do that and trying to get a roster spot for myself
2830327 as a receiver you cant make plays you cant get anything done without your quarterback
2830328 definitely i consider myself a deep threat and i have since high school
2830329 my speed thats always been my notch on anybody else
2830330 the fact that you can get the ball down the field and have someone who can get the ball to where it gets the defense on its heels a little bit you enjoy speed
2830331 david just wants to make sure hes not a one hit wonder that there are some other singles coming out here in his future
2830332 hes doing everything weve asked him to do as a coach youre really proud of guys like brett ratliff and david clowney when they marry their talent to their work ethic
2830333 it is obviously the selling clubs prerogative to put whatever
2830334 i decided to forget that i hit the ball in the water
2830335 i enjoyed seeing the fans making the wave and applauding when i went up to the green it felt really good
2830336 the leader was four shots ahead of me so i thought id just go out and have fun im very happy
2830337 i was nervous i hardly dared to talk to her
2830338 before the tournament i wanted annika to win it shes my favorite player
2830339 i knew this was my last tournament in sweden im enormously thankful for the fans support this week

2830346 the joint partnership will yield valuable data and a greater appreciation of the practicality of an all electric vehicle in california
2830347 we want to caution people that if they see this stolen camry especially if its occupied not to approach this vehicle not to make contact with it
2830348 we are urging them to call 911 or our nonemergency number 441 6000 and provide any information they can about the whereabouts of this vehicle
2830349 for many years i have warned against russian actions that undermine the sovereignty of its neighbors
2830350 unfortunately we have seen in recent days russia demonstrate that these concerns were well founded
2830351 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
2830352 register now for just us 7 50 it takes endless hours of work to produce nifty 3d screen savers at the high quality you have come to expect from useless creations and all we ask in return is a very small fee
2830353 the main reason for my comeback is to help the club but i also want to play again
2830354 there was a bit of tension since that match at bordeaux but the team reacted well its good to start with three points
2830355 a hero is an ordinary individual who finds the strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles
2830356 an hour with a book would have brought to your mind the secret that took the whole year to find the facts that you learned at enormous expense were all on a library shelf to commence
2830357 radio buttons to respond without having to scroll to those buttons just bugs the hell out of me but i generally put up with it i guess i should learn to be more tolerant in other areas as well
2830358 an hour with a book would have brought to your mind the secret that took the whole year to find
2830359 we are blossoms from the same tree planted in the naval academy

2830361 the fuse bit is neither readable nor writable in the active programming mode
2830362 i hope im that guy at field corner now hopefully by the end of the year you will know me over there progress here has been good even though i had a little situation off the field had some grade issues in the spring im still working hard on my academics it was an issue in the spring but ive worked hard off the field and on it to prove myself that i can do the job
2830363 two years behind brandon flowers it was a good experience i knew the caliber player he was and like coach gray says we have to be patient and know our role on the team so i did my best as a special teams player
2830364 oh man i learned a lot like getting out of breaks reading receivers body language i learned a lot
2830365 thats my expectation to be the next best thing that comes out of virginia tech we put a lot of dbs in the league and i want to be one of those guys
2830366 the mental part of the game i came a long way from my freshman year im moving fast now
2830367 we like to go get it to be aggressive this secondary its going to be the best secondary youve ever seen weve just got that swag were going to see after this season we have a goal to be the best
2830368 we plan on getting picks i plan on getting at least three and after i get three thatll probably go up
2830369 yeah i did that the school takes care of all the paperwork i really dont know how much its worth i just go through john ballein and they take care of it up there
2830370 during the summer times before this summer i was going home like i went home for the first summer session this was the first summer i really stayed the whole entire summer i consider myself a physical cornerback but i knew i could get more physical i could be stronger attack better than what i was doing in the past knowing im playing the boundary corner i stayed the whole summer im physically right now i got faster leaner stronger im just ready to play the little stuff like that i knew i had to stay here at tech to get it done working out with coach gentry
2830371 nah it looks like its going to be legit im going to be playing receiver im practicing it now
2830372 its nothing big they have me running down the field trying to get me out in space thats basically it
2830373 team period when its 1 versus 1 i go with the first group on defense then i come back over and play a little bit of wide receiver
2830374 im not expecting much id say anywhere from 7 10 touches a game im hoping well see
2830375 i havent made my list yet but before the first game im going to make my list every year i do basically as an individual i just want to compete and win every down and as a team we just want to win
2830376 he has stepped his game up as far as the mental part of the game weve got great athletic corners that are ready to play right now we could play man to man and wed lock them down but playing for coach gray and coach foster in this defense you have to have the mental part down and virgil excels at that part
2830377 i can remember i think two days ago he jumped a slant route and took it to the house i mean it was pretty really really really pretty he read the three step he broke downhill he picked the ball and he took it to the crib
2830378 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2830379 after many centuries we have an indigenous president so the traditional parties do not want this advance
2830380 the president uses victimhood frequently attacking the whites making it a racial issue
2830381 weve also seen several morphs of this spam over the past couple of days
2830382 this is likely in response to all of the media attention and awareness that has been brought up over the past couple of days
2830383 my assumption is that they took the time and effort to do some reconnaissance of sites which are vulnerable to remote file inclusion or other type of remotely exploitable flaw within their web applications that would allow someone to locally host all the malicious files
2830384 i wouldnt be surprised if i find out that someone has basically went through all keylogged cpanel passwords he obtained through his botnet or through the access to a botnet that he temporarily rented
2830385 i am a huge admirer of vedran he is a top class player with a bright future ahead of him and i am delighted that he continues to be a part of our plans at manchester city
2830386 rio is now the best centre half in the world by far
2830387 that was an exemplary performance he did not give one foul away and intercepted every ball that came towards him
2830388 he broke out of defence in comfort so many times it was unbelievable he is a magnificent player
2830389 he is 30 now and because he has experience his potential is now being fulfilled in a big way
2830390 originally ryan did not want to be captain but he is comfortable with it now
2830391 but gary neville represents the heart of the club that is why i gave him it in the first place
2830392 i am sure we will find out in due course
2830393 of course it would be an honour but my main concern at the moment is manchester united
2830394 i was down and he stamped on me i thought he could have avoided me there was no need for it
2830395 we didnt particularly practise penalties but its a very disappointing way to lose the shield
2830396 you cant win anything if you dont even test the goalkeeper
2830397 we didnt have the width to provide a better level of service but hopefully that width will come we have glen little out injured and the manager is still looking for new players
2830398 we are trying to play 4 4 2 this season because of the players available but we have got to improve in the area of support for the front two
2830399 we got plenty of effort but some of the players who had international commitments in the summer have not done enough pre season work yet
2830400 we came here today with just 18 players and we know we are going to need a bigger squad because of the extra demands on the uefa cup which is new ground for us
2830401 but we also know that playing in the uefa cup can make premier league form suffer and our priority is still the premier league next season it is going to take a lot for players to play saturday thursday sunday but we have to be competitive
2830402 kaboul should help hes a been a long term target of the manager hes only 22 and is coming to a good place to learn with sol campbell and sylvain distin
2830403 it means a lot you want to get off to a good start
2830404 but its really for fitness and the last game before the start of the season
2830405 we want to start where we left off its going to be difficult the champions league premier league the cups every competition is difficult
2830406 you have to have that hunger but im sure the lads have got that
2830407 taking the 90 minutes into consideration it was a good workout for us
2830408 it would have been nice to win but we look forward to next sunday chelsea at stamford bridge with a lot of confidence
2830409 for 90 minutes it was 0 0 which against manchester united has to be considered a very good result
2830410 i was very pleased with the performance today it was excellent
2830411 how we got to penalty kicks thats one of the mysteries of football
2830412 we had a lot of chances we were the better team but its only pre season
2830413 anyway it wasnt given its early season and it doesnt matter
2830414 diaby will not be available for the start of the season so we will have to work on some things which i saw on friday night it worked well with denilson and fabregas
2830415 you cannot say after just one match you need a run of games to see if it partnership will work but i am confident it will
2830416 cesc has worked very hard since he has come back
2830417 you cannot say he will be at his best but he will be fit enough
2830418 to win big trophies makes you more confident and gives you something you can pass on to the team around you
2830419 at 21 he already has a lot of experience he is an intelligent boy
2830420 but i would not like to put too much pressure on him
2830421 we know every single player in his area is very important
2830422 cesc in midfield is a player now who has maybe more experience than the others
2830423 we are a body short but it is not necessarily to play alongside cesc he can play alongside anybody
2830424 we try to find the right player my target is always to spend the right money on the right player therefore the timing on your buy is also important as well
2830425 i do not know yet if it will be with the swiss or somebody else but it is not necessarily the swiss boy though
2830426 do not forget we have diaby who is not available alex song who is at the olympics he is a very good midfielder

2830481 the visibility of tgs is much better here than at previous ones
2830482 the sex workers are very visible and there are a lot of sessions around their issues no doubt than ever before in the past
2830483 what did they do they fought for their health by advocating for sex work to be recognised as legitimate work and by defending sex workers human rights
2830484 in many parts of the world sex workers do not even have access to basics such as sufficient male and female condoms
2830485 i ask you how do you think sex workers can use abc abstinence be faithful and condom as an effective hiv prevention tool
2830486 nobody in his or her true mind wants to go into this field they talk about it as if it was alright
2830487 people here are not able to find the root cause of why people are selling sex
2830488 why dont they talk more of education livelihood issues and economic empowerment so they leave this work
2830489 some of us have chosen this as our profession of our free will
2830490 we cant find work so we do this not only are we lowly paid but we face extreme harassment from the police our clients and even at times from our masters when we are raped and we report it the police ask us how we can be raped when we are men
2830491 these dancers may provide their services to sometimes a dozen men in one single night and if they cannot perform well enough they are beaten up and subjected to sadistic attacks she said
2830492 last year a stripper in irvine california was raped but she lost the case because she was told by the judge that she was overtly sexual and got what she wanted

2830498 chris youre going to have to come to the republican convention
2830499 this kind of talk in particular the call to oust russia from the g 8 has given pause to seasoned experts on that part of the world who tend to emphasize engagement with russia
2830500 continued commitment youve helped me so much make progress on raising the funds to retire the campaign debt to pay the small vendors who helped us take our message across the country

2830503 in order to prevent the circumstances in which ukraine could be drawn into a military conflict ukraine reserves the right to bar ships which may take part in these actions from returning to the ukrainian territory until the conflict is solved
2830504 it makes a third party involved and its quite unexpected
2830505 you dont necessarily have to use a computer to understand how it shapes the country
2830506 its the frame of reference that comes from being engaged and using the technology and tools that are moving our entire world forward its powering a global economy and bringing about massive change
2830507 this is a man who has a very long history of understanding on a range of issues
2830508 i am forcing myself i am using the computer more and more every day
2830509 i dont expect to set up my own blog but i am becoming computer literate to the point where i can get the information that i need
2830510 mccain brings a lifetime of service obama brings a speech he gave in 2004
2830511 during his eight years in state office obama cast more than 4 000 votes of those according to transcripts of the proceedings in springfield he hit the wrong button at least six times
2830512 how can barack obama who is now running for the president have pushed the wrong buttons your job as a state legislator or a member of the u s senate is to know exactly what you are voting on
2830513 and if you dont know what you are voting on or are confused then you ask somebody but to push the wrong button and then to say i was confused and made a mistake no that is not acceptable you are running for the president you need to be prepared you need to take your positions seriously and know exactly what you are doing
2830514 barack obama angered fellow democrats in the illinois senate when he voted to strip millions of dollars from a child welfare office on chicagos west side but obama had a ready explanation he goofed
2830515 on june 11 2002 obamas vote sparked a confrontation after he joined republicans to block democrats trying to override a veto by gop gov george ryan of a 2 million allotment for the west chicago child welfare office
2830516 shortly afterward obama chastised republicans for their sanctimony in claiming that only they had the mettle to make tough choices in a tight budget year
2830517 in order to prevent the circumstances in which ukraine could be drawn into a military conflict ukraine reserves the right to bar ships which may take part in these actions from returning to the ukrainian territory until the conflict is solved
2830518 you can fool all of the people some of the time and some of the people all of the time but you can not fool all of the people all of the time
2830519 the only thing we have to fear is fear itself nameless unreasoning unjustified terror
2830520 every gun that is made every warship launched every rocket fired in a final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed those who are cold and are not clothed
2830521 a well regulated militia composed of the body of the people trained in arms is the best most natural defense of a free country
2830522 in this springtime of hope some lights seem eternal americas is
2830523 a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people
2830524 im a great believer in luck and i find the harder i work the more i have of it
2830525 government is not reason it is not eloquent it is force like fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master
2830526 those who want the government to regulate matters of the mind and spirit are like men who are so afraid of being murdered that they commit suicide to avoid assassination
2830527 arms in the hands of citizens may be used at individual discretion in private self defense
2830528 he is keen to start his captaincy reign with a win and we are all very keen for that as well i was very proud and fortunate to play under michael vaughan obviously kevin is new but he is pretty open to ideas on the bowling front whatever i have wanted with fields he has been happy to set
2830529 the pitch is pretty good to bat on and it is a quick scoring ground if we get our heads down and bat well we should knock off the runs
2830530 there has been a little bit in it for the seam bowlers and some spin for monty panesar if south africa had got 250 or 260 in front the lead may have been dangerous but i really think the result is in our court
2830531 there has been something in it for the bowlers all the way through definitely a bit of movement even with the older ball after 70 overs our bowlers have not been where they could be during the game but this will be a good time for them to hit their straps
2830532 when he put in only one slip against me i started to have a go outside off stump

2830535 h va kan kommunen og bydelsutvalget gj re for f fortgang i denne saken per dags dato ser det ikke ut som bjark eiendom as har planer om restaurere og gjen pne sv mmehallen
2830536 s vidt jag har f tt brakt p det rene er det en uenighet med kommunen om vedlikehold av folkebadet som ligger bak jeg antar at bjark eiendom as bruker en slik konflikt prim rt for la bygningen forfalle ytterligere slik at de kan rive og bygge helt nytt det vil v re en skandale om s skjer
2830537 its rather interesting all this time i been farming i was thinking it was the sun that made things grow
2830538 im having an affair with my secretary we had sex all afternoon
2830539 theres no way i can be the father of this baby look at the two beautiful daughters i fathered have you been fooling around behind my back
2830540 i cant allow you to be cremated with such an impressive private part it must be saved for posterity
2830541 have this i stood like that for two days at the smiths and nobody offered me a damned thing
2830542 how much for a nice juicy steak and a bottle of wine
2830543 the same thing im doing to his business down here
2830544 i want to die in peace i slept with your sister your best friend her best friend and your mother
2830545 they seem to have gone beyond the logical stopping point
2830546 is the goal of the russian federation to change the leadership of georgia
2830547 we are still very uncertain of the motives in organising such a re enactment
2830548 mccain loves lieberman and he is on the short list because lieberman has never embarrassed anyone never misspoken the first rule is dont take someone who costs you votes
2830549 the crews were assigned the task to not allow arms and military hardware supplies to reach georgia by sea
2830550 in no way in the conflict between the russian and georgian military implicated
2830551 you guys want an independent kosovo okay then support a free south ossetia
2830552 the magnitude of the dollars moves and the breaking of key technical levels suggest that a major shift in the outlook towards the dollar is occurring as massive positions are adjusted
2830553 you put the ball on the ground you have to run and thats the way when we talked about it he wanted it and thats the way i wanted it
2830554 too bad i cant get on it it would sink
2830555 one of the issues around looking at the impact of seizures is that were not quite sure what impact they have because the issue of stockpiling
2830556 we know with a range of other substances like heroin and amphetamines that theres a high level of stockpiling that goes on so when there is a seizure it doesnt necessarily translate to reduced access to the drug on the street
2830557 our sense is that yes this is a big seizure we need to watch it very carefully in terms of the impact but our past history would tell us that the impact at the street level will be minimal if anything
2830558 people would not be sending this quantity of product to australia without a realistic expectation that they stand to be able to move all of this product
2830559 so what youre looking at is a truly phenomenal demand in australia for these sorts of drugs in the modern era
2830560 we have said that this is a condition driven process
2830561 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2830562 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
2830563 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
2830564 this was a heinous attack by al qaeda in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
2830565 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
2830566 al qaeda is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here
2830567 the split will hurt me i will miss him i must simply accept that he wants to build a new future
2830568 its been 10 years now and at one point he just said i have to care about my family more
2830569 he has something in his hands that no one else has
2830570 we havent fully recovered from a natural disaster and now were again being battered by a man made calamity
2830571 all peaceful avenues have been exhausted to resolve the conflict
2830572 we are now compelled to resort to the application of proportionate and justifiable force so that peace and order may be restored in north cotabato
2830573 organising something on the scale of the lambeth conference will inevitably result in a small deficit sometimes
2830574 the archbishops council met last week to propose a solution
2830575 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2830576 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2830577 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2830578 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2830579 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2830580 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2830581 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c
2830582 our stance would not change with sanctions or the threat of sanctions
2830583 it is important that our country is ready to insist on its rights under any conditions
2830584 he translated the pain of the palestinians in a magical way
2830585 he made us cry and made us happy and shook our emotions
2830586 today i have come bearing an olive branch and a freedom fighters gun do not let the olive branch fall from my hand
2830587 he created a national palestinian identity that no other poet could achieve
2830588 a large trend is being crystallized among the palestinian national authority pna in ramallah to call for settling the situation with the gaza strip by force
2830589 to give the last chance for the egyptian government and the arab league to convince hamas to immediately end its coup and engage in the dialogue
2830590 but the door for dialogue will not be open forever and the leadership only gave one month time for the efforts
2830591 will be a dangerous thing if it was officially made
2830592 it will boost the internal split and separate gaza from the west bank
2830593 fatah elements who dominate the plos executive committee have a plan to prevent any attempt of approach between hamas and fatah
2830594 there is a weapons shortage and a shortage of volunteers
2830595 if they continue killing people they wont win any seats in the next election
2830596 weve been seeing a change in the position of politicians
2830597 we want to change the views of ordinary people who are against the sadr movement
2830598 i expect it will be a successful political shift for the sadr movement and a change from guns to culture
2830599 the problem is that these terrorist groups are not motivated by only one or two reasons
2830600 there are groups that say they are from the mahdi army but they are not and theyve destroyed what mahdi army has built
2830601 if sadr cant control the special groups how can he expect to disarm them his call to disarm them will disappear with the wind
2830602 the military institution says it is ok to kill and use the most horrible weapons and that killing the enemy is heroic
2830603 i respect dick for having humanity over his military obligations
2830604 the regular people and the government wanted to surrender but the military people didnt want to surrender
2830605 i believe it is the stubbornness of the military people that caused the bombing of japan
2830606 i was assured no economic blockade shall be allowed and every effort will be made to keep the highway open
2830607 estoy muy feliz de recibir este premio es una alegr a muy grande
2830608 me muero por volver a rep blica dominicana me encanta tu pa s hsi productions la compa a que realiz el video de karma escogi altos de chav n como una de las locaciones porque mucha gente les hab a comentado con anterioridad cuan bella es esa zona

2830610 no me cierro las puertas a nada me encantar a grabar con artistas tan diferentes entre s como gwen stefani john legend y outkast como ver n soy muy ecl ctica en lo relacionado a las preferencias musicales

2830612 que ser m s de ficci n que el anterior
2830613 since the burmese military has ignored the call of the internal national community to begin an inclusive political process and unilaterally imposed a constitution designed to consolidate military rule it is imperative to review the international approach towards burma
2830614 a full blown castigation of the burmese generals could have caused considerable discomfort for bangkok which has just assumed the chair of asean which includes burma
2830615 is the goal of the russian federation to change the leadership of georgia
2830616 sometimes those leaders need to contemplate how useful they have become to their people
2830617 lets state clearly that we are ready to put an end to the war that we will withdraw from south ossetia that we will sign an agreement on non use of force
2830618 we must condemn russias military assault on the sovereign state of georgia including the targeting of civilians and the campaign of terror against the georgian population
2830619 since russia is impeding georgian forces from withdrawing rejecting a cease fire and continuing to carry out military attacks against civilian centers its claims of a humanitarian purpose clearly are not credible
2830620 this statement ambassador is completely unacceptable particularly from the lips of the permanent representative of a country whose actions we are aware of including with regard to the civilian populations in iraq and afghanistan and serbia
2830621 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2830622 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor
2830623 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2830624 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2830625 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2830626 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2830627 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2830628 but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
2830629 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2830630 but im happy with the race and the time so im feeling pretty good about that
2830631 read the papers here and you might think little has changed from the days when chicago politicians got money from al capone
2830632 he doesnt need contractors he doesnt need patronage armies to get elected mayor of the city of chicago all he needs to do is run on his record
2830633 not something you can fully eradicate in any city and its not something that happens overnight
2830634 why say youre for a new tomorrow then do old style chicago politics to remove legitimate candidates he talks about honor and democracy but what honor is there in getting rid of every other candidate so you can run scot free why not let the people decide
2830635 hey shouldnt you sign up for our cardmember protection service
2830636 what sunshine is to flowers smiles are to humanity these are but trifles to be sure but scattered along lifes pathway the good they do is inconceivable
2830637 costs nothing but creates much it enriches those who receive without impoverishing those who give it happens in a flash and the memory of it sometimes lasts forever
2830638 unser training war so geheim dass wir manchmal selbst nicht zuschauen durften
2830639 das war der erste schlag in den nacken aber der wirft uns nicht um
2830640 das sind unsere ersten olympischen spiele seit jahrzehnten wir sind halt nicht so cool wie die anderen

2830642 jetzt m ssen wir halt einen der schweren brocken knacken
2830643 wir hatten uns so viel vorgenommen aber das ist jetzt voll nach hinten losgegangen
2830644 wir sind mit dem falschen bein ins turnier gestartet jetzt m ssen wir halt einen der schweren brocken knacken
2830645 its trial by fire theres drama here this is a tough town
2830646 we have many difficult and challenging assignments every day we wanted to give them some practical exposure
2830647 the symbol of the style and cutting edge fashion that answered the question whats soul in a way that only stax and isaac hayes could
2830648 hot buttered soul and the theme from shaft played and played and played these two very talented men added much to our culture and life experiences they will be missed may their families be blessed in gods peace
2830649 iso osa niist on sellaisia vaivattomia paloja joissa auto syttyy ajon aikana palamaan
2830650 they wanted to make sure they got in and got the bone in place last night which is the easier part of the procedure
2830651 at this time were focusing on the health and welfare of the guests involved in this tragic accident
2830652 look i had five dunks in one game thats because of the crowd last time i had five dunks in a game i was like 17 so thats all because of the energy in this crowd
2830653 i think they knew that history was being made tonight and obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it was for ours you could feel the electricity
2830654 it was our first game we were very anxious we missed shots that we normally would hit but at the end of the day you win by almost 30 points youve got to take good things out of that
2830655 we played very very hard we give ourselves a chance defensively every night thats what its all about with us
2830656 we came out a little tight we knew that it was going to be a very emotional game for both teams especially china playing in front of their home crowd
2830657 we withstood the storm we calmed down and we just played a lot better basketball
2830658 maybe this was our biggest mistake that we think on the floor that this can be continued you know
2830659 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2830660 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor
2830661 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2830662 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2830663 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2830664 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2830665 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2830666 but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
2830667 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2830668 we want to cause as much chaos for the websites as possible
2830669 das war der erste schlag in den nacken aber der wirft uns nicht um
2830670 das sind unsere ersten olympischen spiele seit jahrzehnten wir sind halt nicht so cool wie die anderen
2830671 aber wir k nnen ja jetzt nicht heimfliegen vielleicht haben sich die jungs zu viel ausgerechnet wenn man zu tr umen anf ngt verliert man den boden unter den f en
2830672 jetzt m ssen wir halt einen der schweren brocken knacken
2830673 wir hatten uns so viel vorgenommen aber das ist jetzt voll nach hinten losgegangen
2830674 wir sind mit dem falschen bein ins turnier gestartet jetzt m ssen wir halt einen der schweren brocken knacken
2830675 all athletes should really get the same coverage for instance if both the womens and mens hockey teams are competing they should get the same exposure but that may not be the case
2830676 previous research suggests the number of photos of women is coming close to the number of men but there is still the tendency for women to be shown off the court or off the field and the shots can be of a more sexualised nature
2830677 were looking at 12 newspapers spread across the five countries but are also recording the television news here in new zealand to see how this country approaches its olympic coverage
2830678 our findings will be published in academic journals at a later date but will also be helpful for organisations who want to promote sport
2830679 i just want to encourage you in your stand about prayer and healing having read the article on the bbc new report i too am a doctor though also retired and gladly endorse healing through christian prayer i pray that you will continue to make your stand and see more amp more of the lords mightty work in your midst with blessings in the name of the great physician
2830680 i was just reading the asa adjudication on your leaflet and am appalled that they would make the assessments as they did and prevent you from talking about the power of god through prayer to heal are you taking this any further we are praying for you and standing with you in this matter
2830681 as i was growing up there was always a big sign on a ramshackle distillery near the water
2830682 dia moreno sudah cukup tahu apa yang akan dia lakukan

2830688 we usually only get between 10 and 20 reports a week
2830689 there are a lot of sightings around the atherton tablelands ravensbourne tully and dalby
2830690 id say that is because the sky is clearer and lights in the sky are easier to see the sunshine coast also has a little bit of activity
2830691 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you
2830692 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2830693 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2830694 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2830695 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2830696 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2830697 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2830698 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal
2830699 the revolution if you will in 1776 brought the 13 colonies together against the king and the same thing can happen now against martin luther king with the 50 states
2830700 see richard doesnt really mean what he says its popular for him to say it thats the way he makes a living
2830701 same as jesse jackson some more of our black revolutionaries who make a living off of keeping things emotional
2830702 i dont think the majority of white people are thinking that way anymore
2830703 im concerned that once he gets in office that he wont be recognized as an american president
2830704 we are made up of people of every conceivable racial background
2830705 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you

2830710 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election

2830736 its 1 30 am on a work night is that too late to eat some breakaway berrier
2830737 everything is pretty well fine other than the fact he has stitches
2830738 he was in good spirits last night when i spoke with him and hes anxious to get back
2830739 the room itself reeked of feces and urine leaving it nearly unbearable
2830740 you are the salt of the earth but if the salt loses its saltiness how can it be made salty again it is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled by men
2830741 you are the light of the world a city on a hill cannot be hidden
2830742 although oil prices have been increasing they asian emerging markets have seen an increasing offset in terms of rising exports to the oil exporters
2830743 what people can miss is the magnitude of change this oil price is bringing its probably a 1 2 trillion economy this year for the gcc five years ago it was more like 350bn
2830744 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
2830745 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past
2830746 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
2830747 i think thats part of our civic psychology its deep in our civic dna
2830748 were trying to show off the kind of flavor of what the west has to offer
2830749 the fact is our economy now is extremely diversified resilient and contemporary
2830750 people assume an international cosmopolitan image is at variance with the notion of being a cow town
2830751 the national western stock show isnt partisan it doesnt take sides
2830752 its an opportunity to bring people of all different backgrounds culture races together thats what the west is really about
2830753 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
2830754 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past

2830764 were trying to show off the kind of flavor of what the west has to offer
2830765 the fact is our economy now is extremely diversified resilient and contemporary
2830766 people assume an international cosmopolitan image is at variance with the notion of being a cow town
2830767 there definitely is a certain amount of risk in doing this but everything is dangerous today
2830768 originally it was used for performances only but it gradually entered the competitive field
2830769 i am an acrobatics freak especially once i see a wheel i love the challenge the interesting exercises the beauty of it all the excitement of the people around
2830770 toward the end of my military service i went back to it but it is a gradual return competitions are an option and i also have the desire to compete but when i do so i want to know that i did the best i could beyond that there is a problem of finding trainers in israel one instructor has just started his army service so he is not available there is another one in jerusalem but thats too far for me i very much want to participate in competitions and hope it will work out in the end
2830771 it strengthens the entire body it requires flexibility coordination and courage people respond to it with amazement but once they have digested the entire experience they start enjoying it without worrying that heaven forfend something might happen to them
2830772 but i dont have the money to spend on a nutritionist
2830773 now that im not exercising i have a little time to rest
2830774 with the stroke of a pen the u s court of appeals has opened the door to a massive increase in the penetration of dvr capabilities
2830775 in short order effective dvr penetration could now jump to north of 60 of cable households that is all digital cable subscribers with an even larger increase in dvr outlets per home
2830776 they dont want to watch commercials but they wont pay to not watch commercials
2830777 thus the campus land areas are at risk of being lost and affecting the security of its campuses
2830778 good good weve got a house fire in centralback street
2830779 the fires out but theres a male patient unconscious inside
2830780 ive got the motorbike nearby should i just send him
2830781 the president invited prime minister rudd to address the 2nd global forum on migration and development
2830782 of course we are going to have also our philippine australian ministerial meeting in october and they both agreed that this would be a good time for prime minister rudd to visit the philippines
2830783 so it will be an opportune time for australia to be in the 2nd global forum in as much as this meeting concerns both the sending and receiving countries
2830784 occasionally an exceptional shower may show tens or even hundreds of meteors per minute but around 50 meteors per hour is more typical
2830785 under most favorable clear sky condition there may be 60 to 100 meteors per hour
2830786 the determination of probable cause during preliminary investigation or reinvestigation is recognized as an executive function exclusively of the prosecutor thus the determination of the persons to be prosecuted rests primarily with the prosecutor who is vested with discretion in the discharge of this function
2830787 the secretary of justice in hastily ruling out a conspiracy with respect to salapuddin by underscoring the investigating prosecutors recognition that so far evidence shows he did not take active part in the planning of the crime committed grave abuse of discretion for the nature or degree of his involvement or participation is yet to be established by the prosecution at the trial
2830788 it was thus grave error on the part of the secretary of justice to rely on the retractions made by aunal kusain and jamiri notwithstanding that their claim of torture or coercion is contradicted by the evidence on record showing the voluntariness of their confessions
2830789 saudi government had enjoined all travelers to their country including foreign workers to strictly follow the custom departments new rule on the declaration of cash and precious metals
2830790 the kingdom is among the first few countries which gave special attention to counter money laundering by complying with many rules and international convention
2830791 the proposed policy to be implemented by the saudi embassy soon is anomalous and totally unfair to the filipino workers
2830792 i think a lot of the mistrust associated with jpepa began not as a result of the actual provisions of the treaty but the secretive manner in which the government went about with it
2830793 the government must shift from this policy of minimum disclosure that the government seems to have adopted in all its dealings from the nbn zte project to the grp milf agreement on the bangsamoro juridical entity and others
2830794 some say we could have gotten more others claim we gave up too much let me be candid
2830795 i too feel that we could have negotiated better we could have gotten more the choice before us is not the present jpepa versus another better jpepa that we can pick and choose from
2830796 the choice before us is the present jpepa versus no jpepa and an uncertain future as to when it could be renegotiated again and what terms we could actually obtain at that future time
2830797 its about time that the senate reviews and consults with stakeholders on the need to ratify the amendment to the basel ban convention
2830798 the important thing is to get started with the discussions
2830799 unthinkable as our filipino ancestors shed blood against foreign subjugators for a free and united philippines
2830800 besides it should be the subject of a referendum to be participated not only by the people of mindanao but by all filipinos
2830801 we want to know which of the two systems is better for the 2010 elections
2830802 and there is no point in trying to refute the malicious loose talk about my motivations or ambitions what i care about is sustainable peace in a united philippines we cannot have peace under a partitioned republic we cannot have peace without transparent consultation with our people
2830803 voters themselves are less enthusiastic about the election compared to previous polls
2830804 however despite the efforts of the commission on elections comelec and nongovernment organizations both rural and urban voters understanding of how to operate electronic voting machines is poor
2830805 views amongst voters about the election vary but in general enthusiasm is not high due to the uncertainty over when the elections will be held and skepticism about the ability of candidates to deliver on their promises and remain committed to their constituencies
2830806 campaigning has been muted due to security concerns large rallies and public speeches have not been held the most prominent candidates have distributed leaflets and posters campaigning has focused instead on the use of patronage and family networks through which money can be distributed
2830807 the teachers will no longer burn candles in the counting and canvassing of the result of the election their burden will be drastically reduced with this full automation of the election
2830808 all the preparations for the election as far as security is concerned from the afp and the philippine national police in coordination are in place and the election is expected to go on as scheduled
2830809 the statement of senator roxas has created strong anti muslim sentiments
2830810 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor
2830811 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2830812 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2830813 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2830814 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2830815 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the whack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2830816 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
2830817 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2830818 we only know what we see in the news in the newspapers thats all
2830819 we do think there are many witnesses because at that time around 7 p m there were a lot of people in the park or in the surroundings of the park
2830820 there were also people who were part of the altercation and many people playing sports or just sitting in the park
2830821 wow those are some really good points and i think im going to stick to them
2830822 sen graham cracker what do you think about russia invading georgia
2830823 well chris if georgia hadnt voted for obama in the primary them commies wouldnt have invaded
2830824 senator it is the country of georgia not the state
2830825 in yesterdays most recent tank attack the advancing tanks were supposedly crewed by ukrainians two unidentified bodies found today are said to be black possibly they are americans but we cant say for sure yet
2830826 there were blacks among the dead who were probably either mercenaries or instructors in the georgian armed forces
2830827 there are lots of bodies over there a lot of people have been killed mostly ossetians but also georgians they had american emblems on their forearms and they were in black uniforms
2830828 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
2830829 in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals
2830830 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2830831 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2830832 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2830833 im a young guy with a car and tons of spare time
2830834 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2830835 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2830836 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2830837 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2830838 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2830839 why did they have such feeble strength of 200 in the convoy for the frontier corps 200 is nothing
2830840 when the convoy stopped because of the ieds on the road then the taliban were everywhere in every place they came and attacked the frontier corps
2830841 after the convoy stopped there was fighting for two days the taliban have the natural advantage because there is so much greenery
2830842 today we are homeless shelterless and without education for our children
2830843 the frontier corps was taking on the tehrik i taliban just south of its stronghold in mamund
2830844 what was the frontier corps doing on that route the taliban have controlled it completely for one year
2830845 there is no question in my mind that he has been using drugs and using them for at least the last three months
2830846 moreover i am pretty certain that some of you have been taking drugs with cory it is important to note that in this one and only instance there will be no repercussions for anyone who comes forward in fact we are asking those of you who have perhaps been experimenting with cory so that we can make sure that you are not at risk from whatever is wrong with cory
2830847 drop any weapons you have step out of the bus and lie flat on the ground keep your hands where we can see em
2830848 if any of you move from your current positions i will see you and i will kill everyone on this bus have a nice day
2830849 please rearrange your objects because i cant figure out in which order to save them because they have complex interdependencies
2830850 please rearrange the projects in your solution because i cant figure out in what order to build them

2830859 eso fue como un balazo que se escuch alrededor del mundo
2830860 respond to their environment producing natural shadows and highlights depending on the direction and intensity of the illumination around them
2830861 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
2830862 were going to drill here and were going to drill now
2830863 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat
2830864 its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2830865 like george bush and dick cheney before him he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than 1 million from big oil just last month
2830866 like all compromises this one has its drawbacks it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
2830867 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2830868 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2830869 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2830870 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2830871 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2830872 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2830873 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2830874 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2830875 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2830876 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2830877 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2830878 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
2830879 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2830880 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2830881 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
2830882 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
2830883 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2830884 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2830885 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2830886 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2830887 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2830888 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2830889 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2830890 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2830891 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2830892 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2830893 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
2830894 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
2830895 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
2830896 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
2830897 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
2830898 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
2830899 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
2830900 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2830901 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2830902 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2830903 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2830904 aunque no hay fallo alguno en mi contra me siguen maltratando
2830905 no estoy dispuesto a que mi honra y la de mi familia sean tiradas a los perros
2830906 hace m s de una d cada que soporto que mi nombre sea impunemente tra do llevado y manchado con infundios de distinta naturaleza durante todo este largo per odo he estado sometido al escrutinio de la justicia y al manoseo de gobiernos y fuerzas hostiles he colaborado con las investigaciones de los tribunales aportando toda la informaci n que me fue solicitada y ofreciendo espont neamente piezas informativas que no me hab an sido pedidas mi vida y mi patrimonio se han convertido en una materia transparente y sin embargo aunque no hay fallo alguno de la justicia en mi contra el maltrato no cesa
2830907 ahora se difunden nuevas versiones falsas y calumniosas sobre mi persona basadas al parecer en dichos de una persona sospechada o imputada por la justicia alemana no se trata siquiera de un dictamen de jueces sino de la palabra atribuida a un sospechoso de delitos en alemania
2830908 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2830909 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2830910 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2830911 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2830912 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2830913 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2830914 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2830915 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2830916 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2830917 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2830918 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2830919 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2830920 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2830921 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2830922 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2830923 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2830924 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2830925 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2830926 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2830927 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2830928 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2830929 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2830930 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2830931 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2830932 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2830933 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
2830934 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2830935 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2830936 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2830937 the jonah factor 13 spiritual steps to finding the job of a lifetime
2830938 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2830939 yes we promised to provide free access to the internet except for a few that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people as in any other country there are some kinds of limitations
2830940 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2830941 are you prepared for the task at hand physically mentally emotionally
2830942 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2830943 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2830944 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2830945 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2830946 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2830947 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2830948 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2830949 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2830950 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2830951 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2830952 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2830953 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2830954 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2830955 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2830956 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2830957 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2830958 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2830959 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2830960 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2830961 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2830962 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2830963 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2830964 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2830965 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2830966 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2830967 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2830968 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2830969 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2830970 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2830971 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2830972 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2830973 the court ultimately came to a very very wrong conclusion
2830974 the anatomy of a subway hack breaking crypto rfids amp magstripes of ticketing systems
2830975 the first notice that the mbta provided that they were going to the court was after they had gone to the court
2830976 the statute on its face appears to be discussing sending code programs or similar type of information to a computer and does not appear to contemplate somebody who is giving a talk to humans
2830977 reflects the courts view that they believe that the massachusetts bay transit authority was likely to succeed on the merits we think thats actually not the case
2830978 courts have found that the first amendment covers these things
2830979 we believe that this is a protected speech activity when you discuss security issues if you are telling the truth that is something that should be protected
2830980 we felt due to verbal comments that were given to us that the issue was resolved
2830981 they asked for some materials to be submitted to them which we agreed to and we did get those to them yesterday
2830982 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2830983 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2830984 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2830985 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2830986 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2830987 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2830988 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2830989 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2830990 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2830991 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2830992 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2830993 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2830994 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2830995 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2830996 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2830997 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2830998 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2830999 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2831000 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2831001 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2831002 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2831003 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2831004 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2831005 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2831006 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
2831007 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
2831008 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
2831009 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
2831010 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2831011 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2831012 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2831013 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2831014 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2831015 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2831016 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2831017 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2831018 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2831019 just so you all know we did set a record
2831020 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2831021 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2831022 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2831023 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2831024 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2831025 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2831026 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2831027 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2831028 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2831029 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2831030 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2831031 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2831032 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2831033 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2831034 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2831035 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2831036 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2831037 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2831038 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2831039 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2831040 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2831041 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2831042 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2831043 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2831044 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2831045 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2831046 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2831047 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2831048 after studying about 1 000 digg com news stories hp said the team was able to make a mathematical model to predict how long it takes for the popularity and novelty of an article to die off and disappear from the front page huberman said their model suggests that arranging a web site so that new and novel items are most prominently displayed is generally more effective at attracting clicks than prioritizing based on its popularity hp said it tried the process on its own web site to select which items are recommended to customers preliminary results according to hp researchers showed a 30 per cent increase in the attach rate of sales
2831049 as people become increasingly resistant to traditional forms of marketing viral advertisements and recommendations are being used more often as an alternative strategy but the lab found that while the likelihood of someone buying a product does increase with the number of recommendations at first it soon plateaus to a constant but relatively low probability of purchase
2831050 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2831051 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2831052 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2831053 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2831054 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2831055 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2831056 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2831057 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2831058 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2831059 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2831060 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2831061 essentially pollution reaches peoples lungs even if they stay inside on high pollution days
2831062 there is no escape from wood smoke pollution particularly in older wooden houses during winter temperature inversions in christchurch or anywhere else
2831063 although the health impact isnt great there were small decreases in lung function during very high pollution days for boys with asthma
2831064 this is the first time that this urine test has been used to detect exposure to wood smoke pollution in new zealand
2831065 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2831066 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2831067 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2831068 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2831069 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2831070 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2831071 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2831072 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2831073 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2831074 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2831075 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2831076 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2831077 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2831078 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2831079 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2831080 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2831081 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2831082 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2831083 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2831084 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2831085 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2831086 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2831087 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2831088 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2831089 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2831090 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2831091 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2831092 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2831093 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2831094 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2831095 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2831096 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2831097 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2831098 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2831099 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2831100 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2831101 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2831102 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2831103 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2831104 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2831105 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2831106 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2831107 how are people using mobile phones in general without any external support
2831108 sorry dat ik zomaar wegging maar het werd me ff teveel ik hoop dat het al wat beter gaat met je buik verder wil ik je zeggen dat ik jouw vriendschap nog steeds heel erg op prijs stel zou het echt heel fijn vinden als we hiermee door kunnen gaan jouw steun kan ik op het moment heel goed gebruiken dikke kuss
2831109 gekrabbeld ik zou het het liefst meteen verwijderen maar dat plezier gun ik ze niet dus ik laat het maar gewoon staan in de hoop dat er geen vragen komen van derden pfff wat enorm kinderachtig
2831110 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2831111 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2831112 schiet me ineens te binnen waar kwam die vraag opeens vandaan
2831113 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2831114 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2831115 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2831116 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2831117 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2831118 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2831119 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2831120 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2831121 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2831122 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2831123 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2831124 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2831125 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2831126 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2831127 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2831128 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2831129 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2831130 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2831131 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2831132 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2831133 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2831134 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2831135 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2831136 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2831137 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2831138 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2831139 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2831140 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2831141 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2831142 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2831143 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2831144 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2831145 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2831146 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2831147 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2831148 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2831149 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2831150 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2831151 they poked us and stabbed us with the machetes and they were asking for money specifically dollars
2831152 we had a few quetzales guatemalas currency but we had no dollars with us on the boat
2831153 i said we need help i said my husband was not moving
2831154 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2831155 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2831156 alles goed al zin in je nieuwe baan ik had je een aantal smsjes gestuurd maar heb daar nooit meer iets op terug gekregen dus vroeg me af of je boos op me bent ofzo of dat je liever geen contact meer met me wil we zijn nu al een tijdje uit elkaar en ik begin de laatste tijd jou steeds meer te missen begin ook steeds meer me zelf af te vragen waarom ik het toen heb uitgemaakt iedere keer als ik jou zie krijg ik het moeilijk en dat heeft er denk ik mee te maken dat ik nog steeds gevoelens voor je heb wat je hier mee moet weet ik niet toch kan ik dit niet voor me blijven houden zelf ben je natuurlijk ook gewoon verder gegaan met je leven en je zal ongetwijfeld iemand anders leuk vinden ik verwacht geen mail terug maar wilde je het toch even laten weten veel plezier en succes alvast met je nieuwe baan
2831157 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2831158 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2831159 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2831160 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2831161 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2831162 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2831163 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2831164 our nation freeing itself from the subjection of a feudalistic tribe was reborn as a people in modern perception nourishing social capabilities determining its own fate and making decisions as sovereign subjects
2831165 re recognition of the 60 years of our national founding
2831166 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2831167 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2831168 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2831169 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
2831170 an act of god on par with moses and the burning bush
2831171 her face grew red when she started to talk about elizabeth edwards fake breast cancer
2831172 first they ran a phony vietnam war hero and a phony southerner
2831173 we called the fire department but it took them a whole five minutes to show up by which time it was too late
2831174 i thought to throw my gin and tonic onto her to cool her down
2831175 but figured that the alcohol would just make matters worse so i dashed over to the co 2 fire extinguisher in the corner but by the time i figured out how to get it to work
2831176 though her writings were much loved by the like minded throughout the country ann in fact left no heirs or even friends
2831177 until such time as anns estate compensates us for the loss of our reproduction antique slipper chairs and matching mahogany occasional tables
2831178 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2831179 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2831180 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2831181 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2831182 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2831183 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2831184 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2831185 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2831186 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2831187 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2831188 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
2831189 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
2831190 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
2831191 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years

2831240 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2831241 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2831242 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2831243 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2831244 fellow citizens pardon me and allow me to ask why am i called upon to speak here today
2831245 by the rivers of babylon there we sat down yea we wept when we remembered zion we hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof for there they that carried us away captive required of us a song and they who wasted us required of us mirth saying sing us one of the songs of zion how can we sing the lords song in a strange land i f i forget thee o jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning if i do not remember thee let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth

2831254 weve also seen several morphs of this spam over the past couple of days
2831255 this is likely in response to all of the media attention and awareness that has been brought up over the past couple of days
2831256 my assumption is that they took the time and effort to do some reconnaissance of sites which are vulnerable to remote file inclusion or other type of remotely exploitable flaw within their web applications that would allow someone to locally host all the malicious files
2831257 i wouldnt be surprised if i find out that someone has basically went through all keylogged cpanel passwords he obtained through his botnet or through the access to a botnet that he temporarily rented
2831258 who are the next big things in rock or alternate music
2831259 we have evaluation teams always looking at issues well certainly take a look at this one all chips have errata and there could be an issue that needs to be checked possibly wed have to investigate his paper
2831260 i think if people are aware about bugs they will force intel to fix them
2831261 i was asked to not make poc code publicly available and i think this is a good point i was asked to not reveal tech info but i disagree because installing protections on the isp side will prevent all possible attack s revealing tech details will not cause chaos and mass attacks so im going to reveal a lot of but not all
2831262 are you sure you want to wear that to dinner

2831266 how quickly will the line come together the running backs should be outstanding the receiving corps wont be bad and even with all the weeping and gnashing of teeth about not having terrelle pryor running the show the quarterbacks arent going to be awful none of it matters unless the line one of the least experienced in america can produce right away

2831272 through the combination of government funding industry support and club sponsorship the stake for the christchurch casino cup makes it the richest aged pacing race in the world
2831273 this initiative is designed to help our racing clubs compete with the money available overseas it will also encourage greater bloodstock investment and the retention of quality horses in new zealand
2831274 high stakes races will attract top contestants from australia and further afield that in turn will raise our international profile and capture the new zealand publics imagination
2831275 we did explore options for two of the 737s to be checked in malaysia however as a space became available at tullamarine a decision was taken to have the work done there
2831276 now is the time qantas should sit down with us to commit now to maintaining maintenance operations onshore
2831277 billions of dollars are spent on sick people curing them rather than preventing illness and xrystal fits into the preventative stage
2831278 it is the first blood pressure monitor with lcd technology and uses blood sugar levels and body weight to track health trends so people can take preventative measures before they become ill if people can easily see the trends over time they will take action
2831279 it talks to our software to track trends and averages which can be either printed out or emailed to a gp it will also give advice such as the correlation between blood sugar levels and weight and health risk
2831280 we were very careful not to try to second guess what people want or think
2831281 the new zealand polymer industry has an annual turnover of 1 billion and 50 per cent of that is plastic packaging which is mainly perceived as an environmental threat
2831282 but we are now using blood meal and changing it into plastic materials we have got the process to work and can extrude and injection mould products
2831283 it will not become a commodity material as volumes although large would not be big enough it will become a niche alternative to existing plastics we are also looking at a biodegradable alternative to glass
2831284 ceos have always said people were their most important asset but they didnt know a lot about them rather than being compliance driven an engagement approach is needed so everyone gets value from the process staff get value in knowing where they are heading with opportunities to develop themselves along career paths while management gains an overview of all people in the business and where their strengths and weaknesses are sonar6 is the worlds only graphics based employment management system it can rate people against performance criteria such as customer satisfaction leadership and motivation and it can identify upcoming talent to help management build succession plans and address retention issues
2831285 innovation is a relentless focus on keeping the product the best
2831286 they poked us and stabbed us with the machetes and they were asking for money specifically dollars
2831287 we had a few quetzales guatemalas currency but we had no dollars with us on the boat
2831288 i said we need help i said my husband was not moving
2831289 the palestinian leadership has been working on establishing a palestinian state within the 67 borders
2831290 if israel continues to oppose making this a reality then the palestinian demand for the palestinian people and its leadership would be one state a binational state
2831291 i thought i was going to die it was unbelievable the house shifted the front door its a solid wooden door its in pieces
2831292 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
2831293 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
2831294 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
2831295 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
2831296 so if he were to pick governor kaine it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what
2831297 we are feeling very very good about where the senator is in the polls and we obviously expect as america the american electorate turns their attentions even more to this race in connection with the conventions we expect to do to do quite well
2831298 i mean it was funny but wearing a clown suit and juggling would be funny too but it doesnt connect with the concerns americans have about gas prices about the war about the economy
2831299 so i think on things like that shoot i hope the mccain camp does more of those ads and well just let them do those ads
2831300 senator mccain is running the same old negative karl rove style ads that were all tired of
2831301 with a restive electorate with an economy thats sort of chugging along with a war in the background at the end of eight years of republican rule in the white house obama should be way ahead
2831302 the fact that he isnt says that there are grave doubts about senator obama
2831303 i would make the argument that part of the reason why senator obama is in the shape he is in today is because hes failed to run a positive campaign

2831334 i wonder if part of the frustration that trans activists feel toward radical feminists is that trans activists see radical feminism made up of the very peeps they insist are covered by the trans umbrella
2831335 of all the groups ever seeking full equality only transgenderism has demanded
2831336 in other words once a special interest lobby convinces enough lawmakers that gender identity should be a protected class then the general public will be even more amendable to the idea that of course people need a vagina in order to express
2831337 while it is always important to balance the needs of various groups in a society striving for equality the insistence on forcing acceptance of the transsexual agenda on the general public without careful analysis or opportunity for nuanced discussion should be a red flag

2831340 senator john mccains campaign accused senator barack obama on thursday of playing the race card citing his remarks that republicans would try to scare voters by pointing out that he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
2831341 the exchange injected racial politics front and center into the general election campaign for the first time after it became a subtext in the primary between mr obama and senator hillary clinton
2831342 give me a break this is the biggest fairy tale
2831343 so there he was this week speaking evenly and with a touch of humor to a nearly all white audience in missouri his goal was to reassure his listeners to let them know hes not some kind of unpatriotic ogre mr obama told them what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
2831344 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
2831345 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run
2831346 the mccain campaign was compelled to respond to this outrageous attack because we will not allow john mccain to be smeared by senator obama as a racist for offering legitimate criticism we have waited for months with a sick feeling knowing this moment would come because we watched it occur with president clinton say whatever you want about president clinton his record on this issue is above reproach
2831347 roland when when senator obama says republicans will try scaring voters because he looks different than other presidents on dollar bills what do you think he means by that
2831348 the problem here is that he tried to link bush and mccain specifically with those comments now you might have bloggers you might have conservative talk show hosts you might have columnists who are making all kind of comments like that who are raising these whole these various issues frankly obama made a mistake and thats why they did change their tune they havent even wanted to talk about it even further and so when the candidate brings that up you need to have facts to back it up if youre going to link to it thats why the mccain comment was very specific he said we did none of this obamas mistake was not saying the larger sort of arena people who might be supporting mccain those folks may be making these kinds of comments thats a mistake he made they must own up to the mistakes they made
2831349 i agree with roland he went too far but it is also true that in all of the that in the overall republican attacks race has not been directly mentioned by mccain and his campaign but its been heavily hanging over the attacks

2831354 the weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world on the contrary they have divine power to demolish strongholds we demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of god and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to christ
2831355 for the foolishness of god is wiser than mans wisdom and the weakness of god is stronger than mans strength brothers think of what you were when you were called not many of you were wise by human standards not many were influential not many were of noble birth but god chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise god chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong he chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things and the things that are not to nullify the things that are so that no one may boast before him it is because of him that you are in christ jesus who has become for us wisdom from god that is our righteousness holiness and redemption

2831379 the international community and the most influential countries in the current situation to make every effort to support and promote initiatives aimed at reaching a peaceful and lasting solution for the sake of open and respectful coexistence
2831380 in the increasingly dramatic news of the tragic events taking place in georgia these beginning from the region of south ossetia have already caused many innocent victims and forced a great number of civilians to leave their homes it is my earnest hope
2831381 that the military action may cease immediately and that partly in the name of a shared christian heritage further violent conflict and retaliation may be avoided which could degenerate into a much more widespread conflict may the path of negotiation and respectful constructive dialogue be taken instead avoiding further devastating suffering for those beloved peoples i also call upon the international community and the most influential countries in the current situation
2831382 to make every effort to support and promote initiatives aimed at reaching a peaceful and lasting solution for the sake of open and respectful coexistence together with our orthodox brethren
2831383 let us pray intensely for these intentions which we entrust confidently to the intercession of the most holy virgin mary mother of jesus and of all christians
2831384 degrading experiences that not infrequently end in terrible tragedy this
2831385 is a typical result of the current so called society of well being which in order to fill an interior emptiness and the boredom that accompanies it leads to experiments with new more exciting more extreme experiences
2831386 that in a society that is always in a hurry vacation may be a time of true relaxation during which we may set aside moments for recollection and prayer which are indispensable for profoundly rediscovering ourselves and others once again
2831387 the journalists and workers in the mass media who have followed me during this vacation i thank you dear friends

2831390 neck and neck race between 2007 and this year over the issue of ice loss
2831391 we thought arctic ice cover might recover after last years unprecedented melting and indeed the picture didnt look too bad last month
2831392 and it now looks as if it will be a very close call indeed whether 2007 or 2008 is the worst year on record for ice cover over the arctic
2831393 weve never seen any kind of opening like this in history
2831394 it is not only record setting its unprecedented it doesnt resemble anything that weve observed before
2831395 because it was the class leader i was my job

2831399 i am sure you will appreciate that my clients were severely damaged as children accordingly they are hurt scared and scarred
2831400 a failure to prosecute and convict would be the ultimate betrayal of them by the government it would be the ultimate rejection of them and of their rights as human beings
2831401 police are being thwarted by those in charge of the prosecution
2831402 i can quite clearly say that the investigation is being held up
2831403 there are people on the island who just dont want us going down the route of this inquiry

2831408 in none of the evidence presented did you ever see him brandishing a weapon at all even when he was captured and the evidence all showed that there was an ak 47 right there in the front seat the guys behind him and in front of him deployed weapons he bailed out of the car and ran
2831409 when he knows that hes in u s hands when he is relatively secure that no one is going to bring harm to him or his family you can understand that the level of cooperation changed and thats very understandable again from our point of view as armed forces members
2831410 it was a framework which we were told to operate in its different from a regular ucmj uniform code of military justice court martial type proceeding we understood that from the get go we understood the judges instructions

2831440 unfortunately i didnt instead i began trying to explain that we met together as a community of friends and that we prayed and worshipped in our homes and encouraged one another in daily devotion to jesus
2831441 i just told you that we meet in our homes to break bread together and pray together and learn together regularly
2831442 i dont think he really heard what i was saying though he smiled impatiently and then continued it sounded distinctly like the next bullet point
2831443 and the bible says that many will become deceived by false teachings dont you think that there is a danger that you will become deceived because you are not receiving proper teaching from christian leaders

2831468 making stricter the anti conversion law that has increased persecution of christians
2831469 the amendment introduced in the house assembly on friday july 21 requires clergy and prospective converts to notify authorities of the intent to change religion one month before a conversion ceremony in its current form the madhya pradesh freedom of religion act of 1968 requires that notice be sent to the district magistrate within seven days of conversion
2831470 the advance information must state the name and address of the person converting along with the date and venue of the conversion ceremony after which authorities will decide whether the conversion was forced or by allurement
2831471 the penalty for failing to notify the administration remains imprisonment of up to one year or a fine of up to 1 000 rupees us 21 or both presented by state home minister nagendra singh the amendment was passed by a voice vote without discussion
2831472 this violates the fundamental right of the people as it is the government which would decide if a person can be converted or not indira iyengar member of the madhya pradesh minorities commission told compass she questioned the necessity of the amendment
2831473 despite the fact that numerous cases have been lodged against christians on charges of conversion not even a single person has been convicted by a court of law she said
2831474 he came to his own but his own received him not
2831475 frequently hindu extremists have invoked the states anti conversion law as a means of inciting mobs against christians or having them arrested without evidence
2831476 obviously the life of christians has become miserable at the hands of miscreants in connivance with the police they noted in their report
2831477 among other incidents of christians arrested under the anti conversion law last october a christian worker was jailed in indore madhya pradesh after members of the dharma raksha samiti drs or religious protection committee a hindu extremist group surrounded the heera nagar police station protesting conversions
2831478 john who ran three schools for children was accused of converting 11 children between the ages of 5 and 10 even though none of the children had converted to christianity or complained of attempted conversion

2831582 the 47 if your name is powell jibe is a clear attempt to try and discredit our candidate by associating him with a misdemeanour which he had nothing at all to do with
2831583 while we certainly wouldnt condone speeding it is surely something many of us have been inadvertently guilty of at one time or another

2831585 steve belzak has decided to have a pop at me about speeding
2831586 but the only person the leaflet can be aimed at is the candidate stephen powell my brother

2831620 the enormous gains of civilisation are constantly being called into question what were once rightly seen as huge benefits to humanity are now viewed with anxiety the water that we drink and use to clean ourselves is seen as a scarce resource cheap food which has liberated us from the curse of constantly living on the edge of starvation is blamed for causing obesity long distance travel is stigmatised cars are blamed for causing pollution and contributing to global warming aircraft are also accused of damaging the environment and the passengers they carry are criticised for undermining local cultures attacks on modernity have their origins in the west rather than the middle east if a war is to be fought it should be against the ideology of anti modernism emanating from western societies

2831666 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2831667 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2831668 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2831669 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2831670 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2831671 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2831672 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2831673 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2831756 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand

2831778 it is not typical of what we usually run into with the coaching community nationally

2831829 well i know somebody i have a relationship that might be helpful
2831830 why would anyone want this country it seems like you guys didnt want it before islamic extremism especially armed with destructive weapons seems to be the big issue after 9 11 thats not here we dont really have those kinds of extremists in iraq theyre up in afghanistan and pakistan and the tribal areas
2831831 oh gosh he says there are no wmds why doesnt he give us something he can use for our case
2831832 we could walk to baghdad instead of fight our way to baghdad if we decide to go forward
2831833 what the hell are we supposed to do with this george
2831834 no matter what the guy says about wmd dont cut the channel off just because hes saying what you dont want to hear
2831835 you know what it was a bit of a trap we were asking habush to prove that weapons he said dont exist actually dont exist
2831836 if you guys had not faked us out on sabri and told it straight that sabri was saying there were no wmd by the time habush arrived it would have been absolutely definitive and impossible for us to go forward with those two guys together
2831837 if we knew about sabri at the time habush arrived it would have been essentially a no question issue we wouldnt have been able to go to war
2831838 we have recently learned that there may not be any wmd in iraq
2831839 why werent we given the real choice of what the government officials actually knew about the case for war about what was going through their heads so we as the american public could decide now there are 4000 dead 19000 maimed amputees enormous blood and treasure spilled and crucially americas moral authority in the world profoundly compromised now five years later
2831840 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from habush as outlined in mr suskinds book
2831841 i never received any instruction from then chief rob richer or any other officer in my chain of command instructing me to fabricate such a letter further i have no knowledge as to the origins of the letter and as to how it circulated in iraq
2831842 looking back maguire shakes his head incredible arrogance in the face of facts and reality from start to finish and even making us create fabrications like that habush letter
2831843 a cia source with whom i spoke said that blackwater founder eric prince is very tight with top agency officials and has a

2831848 im ready to go in front of senate committees and house committees im ready to have my moment
2831849 this is an awful lot in one little letter isnt it solving several problems at once it seems even though it does solve all the white houses problems instantly in terms of the al qaeda connection to saddam hussein and the yellowcake from niger it seems a little too um perfect and convenient
2831850 well it was intended to affect the iraqi public opinion on wmd
2831851 a check the box solution checking each box that the white house was concerned about all in one letter
2831852 the idea that the white house had anything to do with a forged letter purportedly from habush to saddam is absurd
2831853 oh we would never do such a thing thats utterly ridiculous
2831854 absolutely not weve checked and we absolutely know that this never happened
2831855 we try to be more patient these guys are not going to breathe without us knowing weve got them all mapped out so we can get actual hard evidence and then prosecute them in public courts of law get real prosecutions and long prison terms thats the british way
2831856 oh after all these years we got a shrug from the americans a kind of non denial denial if you will and now we know the truth
2831857 you know those newspaper columns where the guy has a deadline and nothing to say so he does a
2831858 plate sin with gold and the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks arm it in rags a pigmys straw doth pierce it
2831859 one of the worlds foremost scholars on hitler and nazi germany

2831863 autumnal nothing to do with leaves it is to do with a certain brownness at the edges of the day brown is creeping up on us take my word for it russets and tangerine shades of old gold flushing the very outside edge of the senses deep shining ochres burnt umber and parchments of baked earth reflecting on itself and through itself filtering the light at such times perhaps coincidentally the leaves might fall somewhere

2831868 its a question of weve been reading about this for three four weeks now
2831869 quite frankly its nice to know that everything else is still kind of doing some business

2831874 your concern is our concern your sadness is our sadness you must know we will never forget you
2831875 the two major factors that determine how much energy is available are the vertical rise of the roof and the pitch or angle of the roof the more rise there is the more wind will hit it and be moved upward towards the vawt this is good however the steeper the roof is the more wind energy will be lost in pressure against the roof and wind moving around the roof and the building as a whole this is not so good a roof with a 10 foot vertical rise and a 30 angle will provide nearly a 200 increase in the amount of wind energy that is available to be turned into electricity compared to the same turbine just sitting on a pole the roof effect increases the power yielded by operation of the wind turbine dramatically
2831876 we have a national political agreement that seeks to bring all our people together irrespective of party affiliation this compromise solution with its glaring and attendant limitations is the best temporary measure
2831877 the reality is that the u s has invested too much especially in the last eight years in building its stock of wasteful housing capital whose effect on the productivity of labor is zero and has not invested enough in the accumulation of productive physical capital equipment machinery etc that leads to an increase in the productivity of labor and increases long run economic growth this financial crisis is a crisis of accumulation of too much debt by the household sector the government and the country to finance the accumulation of the most useless and unproductive form of capital housing that provides only housing services to consumers and has zippo effect on the productivity of labor so enough of subsidizing the accumulation of even bigger macmansions through the tax system and the gses and these macmansions and the broader sprawl of suburbian exurban housing are now worth much less in npv terms not only because of the housing bust and the fall in home prices but also because a the high oil and energy prices makes it outrageously expensive to heat those excessively big homes b households living in suburbian and exurban homes that are far from centers of work business and production that are not served by public transportation are burdened with transportation costs that are becoming unsustainable given the high price of gasoline so on top of the housing bust that will reduce home values by an average of 30 relative to peak high oil energy prices make the same large homes in the far boonies of suburbia exurbia worth even less probably another 10 down because of the cost of heating palatial macmansions and because of the cost of traveling dozens of miles to get to work in gas guzzling suvs thus it is time to stop this destruction of national income and wealth that a cockamamie decades long policy of subsidizing the accumulation of wasteful and unproductive housing capital has caused
2831878 that if you speak out then bad things will happen

2831881 bernie mac was a gifted talent whose comedy came from an authentic and highly personal place
2831882 he was a tremendous live performer and a wonderful actor
2831883 it was innovative it was new it was different it was mine it was my vision it was my heart it was my life it was nothing fictitious it was a true story it was my humor

2831885 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2831886 the bernie mac show makes a strong case for the funniest family sitcom on tv finally getting a series of his own hes knocked around as a supporting player for years this foul mouthed mans man with a bitter attitude and a brutally honest approach to parenthood brings to mind married with childrens al bundy but assumes a more convincing persona right out of the gate mac reinvents the wheel here using his warped sense of humor buggy eyes and massive frame to intimidate and discipline some very bratty young uns

2831963 we have had good turnouts with strong attendance at events from those involved in learner driver training and other road safety professionals
2831964 however one of our main target audiences are the younger generation and a mainstay of this consultation is about better driver education at an earlier stage and how we can help learners develop into safe and responsible drivers
2831965 the information obtained from this consultation will be used to help reform and re shape our national driving test this is an important process and that is why we are extending the consultation period to reach out to and attract greater participation from younger audiences
2831966 one in five deaths on british roads involves newly qualified drivers i was appalled to hear that the statistics are so high i know how much young people enjoy the freedom that driving brings but it is also a huge responsibility that must be taken seriously
2831967 changing the way that people are taught to drive and making the test more real can only be of benefit the government has set out proposals to change this system and now its up to you to have your say we all use our roads in one way or another so it is important you register your view before the consultation closes
2831968 we very much enjoy races organised by the royal ocean racing club as they are well organised and the club make us feel very much at home we are really looking forward to this race especially some blue water sailing in the atlantic
2831969 dropped footways are provided to help wheelchair users and those with powered mobility vehicles or prams get around easily and safely they also allow residents to easily reach their garages or park on their driveways
2831970 the same rules should apply to allow councils to enforce against double parking a dangerous activity that causes an unnecessary obstruction of the road putting all road users at risk
2831971 while we believe signs and markings are not necessary in these specific and restricted circumstances we expect local authorities who want to use these powers to publicise their plans to do so all other restrictions will continue to require clear signs and markings
2831972 the bpa welcomes the governments decision to consult on proposals to clarify the law regarding the enforcement of double parking and the obstruction of footway crossovers where this is undertaken by local authorities as part of civil parking enforcement we must be absolutely sure that this power which has been used in london for a number of years is implemented in a fair and transparent way and this consultation will allow all stakeholders to comment on the application of these new rules across the rest of england

2832020 why dont we have more outcries about hormones and campaigns to save the fish populations why arent environmentalists lobbying on capitol hill to keep these chemicals from being dumped into our rivers
2832021 maybe because the source of these chemicals is not some corporate polluter but something a little more dear to the left human birth control pills morning after pills and abortion pills
2832022 the protection of the quality of our environment is impossible in the face of the present rate of population growth
2832023 laws policies and attitudes that foster population growth or big families or that restrict abortion and contraception should be abandoned and comprehensive and realistic birth control programs should be available to every member of our society
2832024 prominent women in the global environmental movement believe there are strong links between the health of the environment the ability of women to engage and lead their communities and their ability to exercise their inherent reproductive rights women have a stake in a clean environment because they are often the main providers of food and water and their reproductive health can be adversely affected by environmental degradation
2832025 by any standard typically used by environmentalists the pill is a pollutant it does the same thing just worse as other chemicals they call pollutants
2832026 outright denial at there being a problem obfuscation of the science when strong arguments are presented attempts to deflect attention onto much rarer and less harmful industrial estrogen and ad hominem accusations in this case an allegation of religious zealotry being in the pay of the very well funded pro life industry i imagine the effort will be based on making it unacceptable to bring up the issue in polite conversation such that anyone who does so will end up stigmatized astonishing how often the left resorts to shame rather than thinking about guilt some radical greens may actually be honest enough to admit there is a problem they will be marginalized by the environmental industrial entertainment complex to paraphrase fox mulder

2832203 nothing to worry about really side effects and all that and if you even think about putting your hands there ill ill ill get back to you on that

2832226 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2832227 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2832228 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2832229 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2832230 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2832231 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2832232 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2832233 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2832234 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2832235 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2832236 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2832237 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2832238 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2832239 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2832240 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2832241 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2832242 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2832243 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2832244 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2832245 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2832246 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2832247 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2832248 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2832249 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2832250 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2832251 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2832252 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2832253 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2832254 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2832255 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2832256 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2832257 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2832258 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2832259 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2832260 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2832261 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2832262 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2832263 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2832264 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2832265 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2832266 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2832267 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2832268 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2832269 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2832270 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2832271 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2832272 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2832273 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2832274 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2832275 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2832276 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2832277 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2832278 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2832279 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2832280 done a lot of things in her life ive cut down trees and ive canned over a thousand cans of peaches and i love tools
2832281 i followed svetlana to simply gorgeous day spa from her other location at the time i didnt even know that it was going to be called that
2832282 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2832283 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2832284 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2832285 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2832286 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2832287 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2832288 i followed svetlana to simply gorgeous day spa from her other location at the time i didnt even know that it was going to be called that
2832289 oh my god this is like blueberry muffin but deep fried and glazed

2832294 hey somebodys gotta cover me my ex boyfriend is getting beat up at a club
2832295 its a great location overlooking the water with a fun little patio that was perfect on the sunny day when we went
2832296 i followed svetlana to simply gorgeous day spa from her other location at the time i didnt even know that it was going to be called that
2832297 do you want an entree with your side of sauce
2832298 im not super hungry but will join my friends for dinner anyway
2832299 no honey a pixie cut will not work for you
2832300 its easier for me to work with it in layers
2832301 i should come in more often and take better care of my hair
2832302 my hair could never look like that even with a great cut youre follically blessed
2832303 thats the new prices if you dont want to pay them someone else will
2832304 the owner has told us that today we can only sell water in a bottle
2832305 youve got to lose weight dont order the greasiest pizza
2832306 in the past i have visited aestheticians who have made a few extractions slapped on a few different masks then whisked me out the door
2832307 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2832308 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2832309 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2832310 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2832311 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2832312 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2832313 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2832314 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2832315 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2832316 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2832317 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2832318 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2832319 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2832320 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2832321 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2832322 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2832323 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2832324 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2832325 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2832326 who are open to doing something on the production side
2832327 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2832328 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2832329 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2832330 ive never had a sit down meal here but when i used to work in downtown berkeley my coworkers and i would take an 11 am tally of who
2832331 oh youve never heard of this band im not surprised
2832332 i have been many times and will only rate it for my experience this past tuesday june 10 2008
2832333 what can you repeat yourself or sorry i couldnt hear you
2832334 i said no but from the lack of response from the waiter youd think she just told him the earth was round or something
2832335 here is a bar that scares the hell out of me professional alcoholic and internation gentleman of leisure
2832336 because you didnt pay any cover charge you two will have to leave and if you dont leave in five minutes were going to have to trow you out
2832337 baby girl for this dont be fooled by the cheesy exterior though it is reasonably classy inside
2832338 were keeping our feet on the ground and aim to do what we set out to do 18 months ago and thats all we think about
2832339 the germans were with us all the way but we never felt that they were going to come through
2832340 it was a tough race a heat of the olympics is a step above a world championship final
2832341 this is a very different crew and id expect that
2832342 but were certainly better for it were more experienced and can go into more detail analysis about what were doing
2832343 we won a medal in sydney and it was a break through a historic event well take care of the result first and then let the records take care of themselves
2832344 we had a nice cruise pace in second 500 metres thats what we like a good rhythm and to lead on from that rather than be forced to spin over at high rates
2832345 its just like a dream come true and i hope everyone else can share in it
2832346 there have been so many people who have helped me over the years its been a very long journey to get here i hope everyone else feels the same excitement as i do
2832347 there was so much in me so many emotions and they all came out at once as i crossed the line i wasnt composed enough to take my hands off the handlebars and give a proper salute but i guess thats just the person i am
2832348 emma and sharon raced hard and kept it together on the flat and nicole finished it off the whole team got it spot on
2832349 our race plan went back more than 12 months and sharon emma and i all worked as a team emmas attacking enabled me to ride defensively
2832350 it allowed me to save myself which put me in a good position and put the other teams on the back foot as a team we rode a fantastic race i couldnt wait to give emma and sharon a big hug because they shared in this gold medal too
2832351 its a team race and if you work together youre much more likely to get a good result than if you dont its really satisfying to help someone win a medal because you know youve helped
2832352 afterwards i looked up and saw president bush giving me a thumbs up and holding up the american flag
2832353 phelps has been using that as a weapon for a while
2832354 logic should say he shouldnt go down deep but he beats people off that last wall there is nothing scientific yet to explain why it is effective to take that trajectory
2832355 i saw his body was wide open so as id hurt him with the same punch early on so i went for it
2832356 this was a mature performance from a youngster in his first major tournament in fact i would say he is even a bit more mature than amir was at this stage hes a tough kid he can box fight and is very adaptable
2832357 it was tough last time but this will be harder
2832358 i stayed a whole weekend on the street we panhandled we made a sign
2832359 we made at least 20 in half an hour so if youre ever out of work make a sign homeless please help
2832360 we make pullman north ranch honey maybe i was meant to have a little agricultural operation
2832361 the climate in california intoxicated me when i first arrived there
2832362 it was amazing to me that these people had their own tree but they didnt even bother to pick their own fruit theyd rather drive in their car to a grocery store and buy fruit
2832363 i started to think wow i can eat an orange thats grown here so we started with growing oranges and now i have 120 different varieties of fruiting plants i just went crazy with it
2832364 i play a phil spector type music mogul whos totally out of his mind
2832365 its really amazing because we dont have any restrictions like language problems or sexual problems we can do anything we want and were really out there
2832366 in my episode we had an orgy im doing drugs all the time im smoking grass im having orgies hey its music its rock n roll baby its gonna be an eye opener
2832367 the speedway extends their condolences to the family and friends of anthony hart
2832368 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2832369 jo is certain that this russian girl means nothing to ronnie
2832370 she didnt even seem bothered that ekaterina went to see him
2832371 i try not to date where i work it makes life easier besides the possibility has never really arisen
2832372 i dont say no to anybody because id hope that people wouldnt say no to me because im an actor but theyd have to be a pretty extraordinary
2832373 i felt like i want to work with ben stiller and jack black but my way into the movie is ive got to be tarred and feathered for three months and maybe have my reputation destroyed that was my fear
2832374 then we started doing make up tests and it was like mr potato face can we take that wig off and put these teeth in now put this on now put that on but by the time we were finally in rehearsals i knew i had it
2832375 i just loved to play so much i went to different clubs and told the guys that if they wanted a night off i would play in their place so i got a chance to play all kinds of music because i used to let these guys off
2832376 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
2832377 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2832378 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation
2832379 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honoured to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
2832380 my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
2832381 he couldnt have been a nicer guy he just seemed like a real family man and just a nice guy on the set just very kind of normal guy
2832382 you have to have something sacred to you and the people around you
2832383 cynthia was the one person who could make amy behave and who she would listen to
2832384 cynthia was more like a best friend to amy she kept her feet on the ground after she went theres nobody who shell listen to she certainly wont listen to me
2832385 i hear theyre not letting you get too drunk out here well they didnt say anything to me
2832386 theres been two times now where ive driven by in n out burger chain and im like pull the damn car over i need a triple triple burger dude
2832387 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2832388 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2832389 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2832390 they are coming into your backyard and destroying family history
2832391 several of them had been pushed over and quite a few had fallen and broken
2832392 what they want is to make sure theres enough water for the future that they have a safe reliable supply and the sewage system works
2832393 what they are saying strongly is that they dont want prices going up by more than inflation they are sensitive about prices because of everything else that is going up
2832394 all of you are absolute cunts and i hope if there is a god that you and your families all die in absolutely horrible circumstances
2832395 wir glauben daran dass die ganzen sendungen sehr lustig werden k nnen haben deswegen alle 27 titel sch tzen lassen
2832396 well without joey there its kind of the only option we have
2832397 id rather have corey lead off but he wasnt getting on base so we leave jeff keppinger there and have corey behind him we have speed in front of jay bruce
2832398 were playing hard maybe not as smart as we should some times but were playing hard
2832399 some of its being young trying to create and make things happen
2832400 we just deal with it were not quite there were hoping hell be ready in pittsburgh we have these two games and an off day the off day helps us
2832401 mi sentivo in credito con il destino per tutto quello che la vita mi aveva tolto ma ho sempre creduto che avrei rimesso i conti in pari quel giorno finalmente arrivato sono stato risarcito sto vivendo un momento fantastico sono salito sulla giostra della felicit e vorrei non scendere pi
2832402 no la mamma dal cielo mi sta guidando la sento
2832403 si anche se sono sicuro di essere stato fortunato rispetto ad altri bambini che perdono i genitori ho avuto una famiglia che ha fatto quadrato intorno a me i nonni e gli zii hanno vissuto per me nonna elsa e poi zia sabrina e zia cristina sono state tre mamme mio zio che non era neanche diretto ma acquisito si comportato meglio di molti padri di miei coetanei non finir mai di ringraziarli non avrebbero potuto essere migliori io per sentivo lo stesso la mancanza della mamma
2832404 quello delladolescenza verso i 14 anni prima ero troppo piccolo per capire fino in fondo quello che era successo pap che non avevo conosciuto era morto quando avevo 8 anni e mamma se ne andata che ne avevo 10 non mi resi subito conto che sarei dovuto crescere senza di lei ma ricordo il giorno in cui mi dissero che era salito in cielo come fosse ora a poco a poco realizzare la sua assenza e la musica che mi era entrata dentro sin da bambino in quel periodo divenne il centro del mio universo a lei iniziai ad affidare tutte le emozioni le paure e la rabbia mi chiudevo in camera e solo con la musica trovavo pace
2832405 subito anche quando gli altri mi dicevano che sarebbe stato impossibile a testa bassa testardo solo come i sardi doc riescono ad essere sono andato avanti
2832406 perch amici non richiede soldi agenti o manager devi avere solo qualcuno che creda nel tuo talento qualsiasi altra strada sarebbe stata un investimento economico che non mi sarei potuto permettere quando sei agli inizi di solito dei autoprodurti il primo disco io come avrei potuto farlo
2832407 pu succedere se non resti con i piedi per terra io invece voglio ricordare da dove vengo sono un ex parrucchiere e per non dimenticare le mie origini quando torno a casa faccio ancora qualche piega e ad amici quando eravamo in casetta se cera bisogno di un colore o di un taglio tutto si rivolgevano a me non spetterebbe a me dirlo ma sono molto bravo
2832408 quando decisi di andarmene dal salone di famiglia perch non volevo privilegi sentivo la necessit di dimostrare agli zii ai nonni ed a me stesso che sarei stato capace di fare lapprendista da un parrucchiere che neanche conoscevo sarei arrivato puntuale ed avrei lavorato sodo pur di mantenermi il lavoro cosi stato per che trattamento una volta il proprietario del negozio mi disse di fronte alla cliente che dovevo stare zitto che ero un cretino e non potevo permettermi di parlare con lei ancora mi brucia
2832409 lho gi avuto ora mi guarda in tv e legge le mie interviste
2832410 un regalo alla mia famiglia ma non ne voglio parlare una cosa privata poi mi sono comprato le allstars di tutti i colori la macchina invece non ce lho ancora
2832411 allinizio mi sembrava troppo grande non riuscivo ad abituarmi adesso ci sto prendendo confidenza abito con francesco mariottini arrivato quarto alla finale di amici ndr ed insieme ci troviamo molto bene
2832412 facciamo tutto da soli ed a turno ma io sono pi bravo a stirare non mi batte nessuno ho imparato il sabato sera prima di andare in discoteca se mi volevo mettere una camicia e non era stirata la nonna mi diceva di indossarne una altra allora prendevo il ferro e facevo da solo
2832413 mi sento un p a disagio ma va decisamente meglio rispetto agli inizi le prime volte evitavo gli inviti a feste o serate per non essere in imbarazzo poi ho pensato che avrei potuto passare per uno snob e cos mi sono imposto di essere pi socievole piano piano ho cominciato a rilassarmi
2832414 mi difficile lasciarmi andare con chi non conosco forse sono un p diffidente non dimentichi che sono fieramente sardo
2832415 no ma vorrei innamorarmi di una ragazza timida non mi piacciono le donne troppo intraprendenti
2832416 se lavorasse per un impresa di pulizia sarebbe lo stesso non bado allo status
2832417 si ho gi dato sono stato lasciato e non stato bello dopo che ho vinto amici guarda caso lei mi ha richiamato
2832418 si finire gli studi per fare contente la nonna e le zie loro speravamo di vedermi laureato chiss se ce la far mai
2832419 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2832420 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2832421 mom take it easy you are way too happy about this grommet business what if it fails
2832422 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how
2832423 i cant believe we dont win a race in three or four weeks and were in a slump
2832424 it was a big hit for a bunch of guys
2832425 we were ready to attack i know with nine to go you get up on the wheel and push hard pushing and shoving is ok but that was crazy i guess there wasnt much place to go they kept pushing and shoving
2832426 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2832427 a man who issued orders to commit war crimes which resulted in thousands of deaths of peaceful civilians cannot be viewed by russia as a partner
2832428 we have started operations because we saw the georgian attack on south ossetia and knew abkhazia would be next
2832429 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2832430 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2832431 its no longer possible to listen to georgia talk about a peaceful solution in south ossetia or abkhazia or offer us autonomy georgia has shown its real face
2832432 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2832433 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2832434 you are coming with us to tskhinvali you are not going back i promise you
2832435 why do this why do this to us we are just ordinary people we havent harmed anyone
2832436 you can see nobody wanted to help us the un and the americans they all sat there while we got bombed it was the russians who saved us one more day and this whole place would no longer exist and nor would any of us
2832437 that is human flesh the georgians had not given us time to bury our dead when they attacked
2832438 there are volunteers here from all over the caucasus and russia
2832439 stop asking your questions i havent slept for six days
2832440 look at that the georgians fired the ammunition but it was provided by the british and the americans
2832441 he may be a good man as you say but the georgians are holding many of our good people
2832442 is the goal of the russian federation to change the leadership of georgia
2832443 the reasons cited by the russian authorities do not justify military action in georgia regardless of whether the action is taken in the province of south ossetia or in other parts of georgia
2832444 you darent offer these people a house which costs less than 100m or they boot you out and not very politely
2832445 when i left the basement i saw that a tank had shot right into the side of the building thank god that no one was left there
2832446 i saw a car stopped in the middle of an intersection
2832447 inside the car were a mother father and their two children they were all dead shot by a tank
2832448 we live in the 21st century after all and we shouldnt stoop so low as to wage war
2832449 there should be no hatred between athletes and people in general well leave this to the politicians to figure out
2832450 if the world were to draw any lessons from what i did there would never be any wars
2832451 when it comes to sports we will always remain friends and nothing will affect our friendship even in such a scary event as shooting
2832452 we are friends indeed weve been shooting together for a long time we dont get mixed up in political things sport is beyond politics
2832453 we have our own point of view about what is going on but we think this is a matter for the un not the beijing olympics
2832454 if we need to we are ready to go back to georgia like soldiers but after the president has asked us to stay here we have to respect this
2832455 all of us here journalists officials competitors we are very nervous i dont know why the russians hate us nobody expected what has happened it has exploded for us the olympic games are second now
2832456 we will take measures to declassify defence ministry documents that will permit free access to documentation inaccessible up to now and which has a high scientific and also of course sentimental value for many people
2832457 many of these documents are in the defence archives but we are not the only ones competent to decide what should be declassified or not
2832458 we know the solution will be complex and not particularly rapid but we are clear that we want to open up a new phase and achieve declassification for scientific historical and emotional reasons
2832459 la impunidad se da en muchas partes en las polic as en las c rceles en los ministerios p blicos por los jueces entonces lo que tenemos que hacer es ir abordando cada uno de estos problemas desde el aspecto de su legislaci n
2832460 tenemos que hacer un plan estrat gico para todo el pa s y un pacto pol tico sobre todo combatir al crimen donde lo haya en el caso de la c mara como presidenta si me convocan asistir a alguna reuni n de planeaci n respecto de la cuesti n de inseguridad
2832461 we are twice the size we were two years ago
2832462 the oil isnt going to last for ever and they are setting themselves up for a different future english is the language of the web and if you cant speak english your job chances are diminished
2832463 we are very much driven by exchange rates and we will expect our business to be growing now that the exchange rate is coming back in our favour
2832464 as a total export education is estimated to be worth 2 3 billion thats seriously large
2832465 building business on the back of scholarship students isnt sustainable how long do we expect the saudi government to keep providing scholarships for the only way we can have a sustainable market is if we have a diversified market
2832466 el s ndrome de peter pan la persona que nunca crece
2832467 la sra cfk puede no firmar el decreto de traspaso de mando cada vez que sale del pa s en esos casos el vicepresidente no asumir a el ejecutivo sino que le corresponder a al vicepresidente del senado

2832471 theres still interest in takeo like ive been saying all along
2832472 but other than that i dont have any specifics thats where we are right now
2832473 its going to be one of the strongest linebacking corps in the middle with him and patrick
2832474 as far as football goes hes just a leader hes got that quality about him he knows his stuff he pays attention to his film study hes prepared hes the type of guy you need on a defense thats a plus
2832475 i think it showed some glimpses of what i can do
2832476 im still learning the defense it was a solid game
2832477 i will step back from my day to day producing work on american idol and will be devoting my time
2832478 felt good some at bats a little tardy on other ones
2832479 wed like to win all three on this 10 game homestand but its important we got the first one
2832480 after the game was over i told him welcome back
2832481 sometimes you have to give credit to the guy on the mound
2832482 lees done it all year and unfortunately he was able to do it today
2832483 houve bombardeamentos maci os em gori toda a noite e agora estamos a receber informa es sobre um ataque iminente de tanques russos
2832484 gori est a ser maci amente bombardeada tanto pelo ar como pela artilharia
2832485 ainda n o se encontram l mas parece que est o preparadas
2832486 i see theyve got the hoary old beat up on single parents
2832487 ive got one view on that whatever we do with single parents we have got to be guided by what is in the best interest of the children and its not always in the best interest of every child that mum is at work all day
2832488 and the truth is most people on the dpb are not there for very long
2832489 im all in favour of supporting single parents to get into work but in the final analysis we have to be guided by what is in the best interest of the children in a particular family
2832490 theyve got a lot of things going on in their lives and to tell a single parent they have a work obligation can be too tough
2832491 lets get pregnant then i wont need to find a job
2832492 the truth is most people on the dpb are not there for very long
2832493 thats cold and callous there should be welfare for all regardless of how much work they do earning money through work should be just a bonus
2832494 since you are all such good customers im going to reduce the cost of your daily meal by 20
2832495 i only saved a dollar too its unfair that he got ten times more than me
2832496 why should he get 10 back when i got only 2 the wealthy get all the breaks

2832502 standard english translations of the bible commonly used by conservative evangelicals
2832503 many churches and evangelical groups have embraced the nkjv as an acceptable compromise between the original kjv and a bible with more contemporary wording
2832504 how you are fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning
2832505 some view these as literal sequential 24 hour days this interpretation usually entails the view that the earth is relatively young other scholars nothing that the hebrew word for day yom can refer to periods of time e g 2 4 have proposed the day age theory still others suggest that literal 24 hour days are intended but that these days were separated by extended periods of time finally some scholars argue that the days of creation constitute a literary framework designed to teach that god alone is the creator of an orderly universe and to call upon human beings made in the image of the creator god to reflect gods creative activity in their own pattern of labor this framework hypothesis views the days of creation as gods gracious accommodation to the limitations of human knowledge an expression of the infinite creators work in terms understandable to finite and frail human beings this last group of scholars observes that the universe gives the appearance of great antiquity that the phrase morning and evening seems inconsistent with the day age theory and that the notion of intervening ages between isolated 24 hour days is not apparent from the text
2832506 the bible teaches that you are an immortal soul your soul is eternal and will live forever in other words the real you the part of you that thinks feels dreams aspires the ego the personality will never die the bible teaches that your soul will live forever in one of two places heaven or hell
2832507 the bible teaches that whether we are saved or lost there is conscious and everlasting existence of the soul and personality
2832508 nothing in the bible teaches that the wicked are immortal such expressions as to live forever to exist forever never to die to be immortal nor any equivalent expressions are ever applied to the nature of the soul or the destiny of the lost they are only applied to the destiny of the righteous death is the inevitable wages for sin eternal life is gods gift to only those who believe in jesus christ
2832509 the second death destroys the whole person completely and irreversibly jesus said do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul rather be afraid of the one who can destroy both soul and body in hell matt 10 28 in the second death there is a complete and never ending destruction of the total personality or personhood of the sinner ones life is taken away and eternal life is withheld

2832522 a lot of our supply chain design work was really developed and implemented in the 1980s and 1990s when our capital spending was fairly high as a cost of capacity and
2832523 i could say that the supply chain design is now upside down the environment has changed
2832524 transportation cost is going to create an even more distributed sourcing network than we would have had otherwise
2832525 it was kind of a no brain decision for us
2832526 a major reason was to avoid the transportation costs which are terrible
2832527 cannot take a risk that the just in time system wont function because the whole global trading system is based on that notion
2832528 t hey are going to have to have redundancies in the supply chain like more warehousing and multiple sources of supply and even production

2832542 you can see people screaming or crying because they dont have a ticket recently i went to a disco with friends and all the young people were saying dudamel we want to go to your concert but its impossible because its sold out its really amazing
2832543 venezuela is very important not just because its a place i go to conduct but because my family is there my wife my parents and my musical family i love working not only with the bol vars but also with the other childrens orchestras something that maestro abreu put in our blood
2832544 people say that having three orchestras is a crazy life but its better because you have three families i want to have my own kids very soon in future i still want to conduct a lot but less to be with my family this is natural i think
2832545 its a new world for me and its wonderful to be at la scala and the berlin state opera because they are at the top of the tree with the symphonic repertoire its different because this is the world where i learnt conducting
2832546 but a conductor is a leader a person whom players will follow you can be the best musician in the world but the instinct to keep the attention of hundreds of people is impossible to learn its something natural i think this is the secret of a good conductor

2832554 over 1 300 cancer patients have been left to die in the past 20 months because they were not deemed exceptional enough to receive cancer treatment on the nhs they will have been forced either to go without the life giving treatments or to pay privately for the top up drugs and risk having all their other care withdrawn
2832555 the nhs should be available to all who need it yet 1 300 cancer patients were denied the treatment that could have made all the difference to them thousands of cancer patients have been forced to plead for their lives

2832557 young people are missing out they are doing better than ever in science tests at 14 but hardly any are going on to study triple science at gcse despite the opportunities and learning it offers

2832559 not being a geologist i cant get very technical but it just went kaboom
2832560 the middle of the arch just collapsed under its own weight it just happens
2832561 it could be 24 hours or 2 400 years its kind of a mystery well watch it for a while and will know soon with the middle missing the weight shifts and the remaining pieces will ultimately fall its a matter of how long
2832562 geology in action you hate to see those go down but it happens its a natural phenomenon
2832563 ive played in many big games but the energy tonight was different
2832564 i think they knew that history was being made tonight
2832565 obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it is for ours you could feel the electricity
2832566 the excitement of it the anxiousness of it the anticipation was just crazy
2832567 im kind of glad its out of the way now this game was just over the top
2832568 he basically came up to us and said im here to support you our country supports you and so go out there and kick some butt
2832569 so i think that it will be good for us
2832570 you just had to smile because you couldnt write it any better
2832571 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie

2832575 for a long time in robotics there was this focus on a smart machine an android that would make you breakfast and go out and buy your shopping
2832576 but thats extremely challenging its going to be far easier for us to engineer little simple things and rely on them to organise themselves
2832577 you might have some complex robot that is sent to mars has a technical problem and then the mission is basically over
2832578 with swarm robots even if a percentage of them fails theyll still be able to achieve their goal
2832579 if you design software with typical engineering tools like if this and that then do this its like playing a chess game by calculating all the possible never get there
2832580 one application were looking at in the us is renewable energy technologies
2832581 were going to have to start building solar farms wave farms wind farms all on a scale were not used to hundreds of square kilometers far from population centres
2832582 the world may never witness a ceremony of the magnitude and ingenuity as that which opens the 2008 olympics
2832583 it was a floor show that made the most spectacular revue in las vegas look like a church picnic
2832584 it protects our affiliates our advertisers and shows it to the largest number of viewers possible
2832585 it sort of feels like the entire world is attending a huge party and nbc threw away our invite
2832586 we are heading out on two expeditions each close to a month long to map the full length of the cayman trough
2832587 it is the worlds deepest volcanic ridge and totally unexplored
2832588 we are hoping to find several different types of vents along the ridge
2832589 some of the vents will be very similar in depth to the vents we already know about and because the conditions will be alike we might expect very similar animals
2832590 the deep ocean is our planets largest ecosystem if we are going to use its resources responsibly then we need understand what determines its patterns of life
2832591 they could be hotter than 500c 930f and if they are that hot they will probably have quite different chemistry and life forms we expect to find new species

2832611 look u no i have liked u for a long time do u feel the same
2832612 oh the thinks you can think if youre willing to try
2832613 i noticed that we had a lot of talented kids in our group and a lot of talented leaders so i was like why not put a show together
2832614 its very competitive i turned down a lot of really good people
2832615 when i first got here i didnt really know what to expect or the talent we were going to be getting but everythings come together really well
2832616 its been a rough few weeks we only practiced twice a week so things were looking pretty bad about four weeks ago i was really nervous i wanted to quit the show its looking awesome now
2832617 going once going twice sold to the man with the sideburns and the greasy black mustache ooo excuse me madam
2832618 its just really embarrassing when you crack or something when youre singing
2832619 imagine the space between your toilet and the wall imagine being wedged

2832621 the technical paper was written in light of recent research conducted by sophoslabs which illustrated mac malware is on the rise
2832622 graham puts the threat into perspective but explains that the users interaction with the machine plays a much larger role in determining the success of a data theft attack rather than whether they run windows or a mac
2832623 these are tough economic times for retailers and the impulse to reduce spending is understandable
2832624 however as the research clearly shows savings found through cutting the lp budget could be quickly surpassed by the cost of increased theft
2832625 retailers are under intense pressure to manage costs but any reduction in lp spending has to be measured against the potential impact of increased shrink
2832626 it is our hope that this survey will help loss prevention managers more clearly define the value of their technology investments
2832627 the campus is scattered all over the town and many separate paging systems were being used each paging system had its own specifications and only a small number of the buildings were covered and no centralized calls were possible but we knew from previous experience with the dp6000 that we could deliver a complete paging system providing total coverage over the whole area
2832628 we were not able to use copper wiring between the buildings since the university considered this would be difficult to maintain in the future
2832629 instead the university wanted us to use its sophisticated new fiber optic it network for the paging equipment this presented us with some challenges since an it network is not designed to synchronize with vhf or uhf signals fortunately bosch helped us here with specially designed software to cope with this demand we also developed ip paging inputs ourselves using existing i o switches and using our own software we created a fool proof signaling system from all of the different buildings to the central system we can connect all kinds of urgent information immediately to the appropriate team of well trained professionals within the university
2832630 and we are ready for that we can match up to their plans and we can easily integrate any expansions in the paging system we have already designed for them
2832631 what we like a lot about bosch is that the company provides a more or less open system they really do cooperate in order to give you all the knowledge you need and we could not have done this job without this kind of support
2832632 many other paging system manufacturers like to keep things complicated in order to make you more dependent on their products and services after you have installed their system and that makes it difficult or even impossible to meet special demands from customers but with the open bosch approach its possible for us to maintain customer satisfaction for a very competitive price level during the many years that a paging system is normally in operation and that in the end is a major benefit for us and our customers

2832646 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations

2832652 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2832653 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2832654 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2832655 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2832656 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2832657 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2832658 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2832659 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2832660 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2832661 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2832662 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2832663 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2832664 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2832665 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2832666 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2832667 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2832668 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2832669 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2832670 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that

2832674 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools

2832676 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2832677 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

2832705 being a mother has taught me more about the grace of god and my own shortcomings than any other experience in my life i see gods grace every morning as they wake up healthy and strong as they laugh and giggle as they run and play as their minds develop right before my eyes my biggest lesson learned is to cherish every moment with your children they grow too fast god never gives you more than you can handle and i am going to do all that i can for my little ones especially when they face challenges
2832706 true some of the lessons theyve taught me were not very fun as they were happening but the good moments mix up with the not so good moments in a wonderful curriculum ordained for me by god himself
2832707 i honestly can say that being a mother is the most powerful and important feeling in the world
2832708 god gave me strength when i couldnt go on life when my body was trying to shut down encouragement to my broken heart meals when the refrigerator was empty a place to live when ends did not meet peace in the midst of turmoil and a contentment that went beyond my circumstances sure life gets hard now and then my heart may still become anxious and my mind may begin to assume the worse but today i know that contentment comes from within i have learned to be content regardless of my circumstances because god is faithful to me i am so very blessed
2832709 this is the place i come to share my stories thoughts prayers battles struggles and victories as a christian mom
2832710 thanks to the help and prayers of everyone inside and outside the hospital and all over the world we once again have triumphed over this trial
2832711 he might want to read us some of his poetry first
2832712 the earth mk 2 were making a copy from our original blueprints
2832713 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
2832714 the main source of support for the u s economy in recent quarters has been the strength of net exports
2832715 but the world economy has fallen off the edge of a cliff
2832716 its taking quite a bit of work to extract them
2832717 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
2832718 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
2832719 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
2832720 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
2832721 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health
2832722 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
2832723 it was so thrilling that we actually got away with it
2832724 im glad it ended when it did it would have been a mess
2832725 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
2832726 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that
2832727 to know how truly sorry i am and i am willing to pay
2832728 i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way
2832729 it was an experience its real strange to think on that and how i got here
2832730 i just heard shots pop pop pop i thought it was the police but no it was us
2832731 my wife was a wonderful person and didnt deserve this i fell for a coed it was stupid i sit in my cell and think how the heck did i get here

2832735 the take home message here is its a big deal
2832736 its probably the biggest impact in the shortest time that i can think of
2832737 if i can use some of that heat energy and convert it to electricity you can improve the overall efficiency
2832738 there are several other steps that are required to commercialize the material but were cautiously optimistic that these steps can be carried out successfully

2832744 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2832745 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2832746 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2832747 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the whack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2832748 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins

2832750 i have been a supporter of the olympics in vancouver forever i think its fantastic i absolutely can hardly wait

2832758 there was no one occupying the building it was used as a church office building
2832759 it meant so much to our family that our fellow kelowna residents came out to support connor and canadian blood services
2832760 my son would not be where he is today if not for the blood donated by generous canadians and for that we are truly grateful
2832761 the support we received from the community throughout this blood drive was fantastic

2832775 the protection of those least able to heat their homes is a priority for the government we will continue to work with energy companies amongst others on measures to help the most vulnerable to reduce the amount of energy they use and to lower their bills

2832777 shes always wanted to achieve an olympic gold since she was a little girl
2832778 we were really worried when she fell back and i thought thats the gold gone but she was so determined to win she came through we were just on the edge of our seat for the last 15 minutes and we hit the roof when she crossed the line they laid on some welsh weather for her today but the team worked really well
2832779 we would do it in all weathers she has always had that ambition and she has worked very hard for it
2832780 im very very excited and i just cant take it in at the moment she has done a lot of hard work and preparation to achieve this ambition and she has come up with a result it was never in doubt for us
2832781 we used to see her out on her bike in all weathers nothing would put her off
2832782 we are only a small village and everybody has come out for her it is absolutely brilliant

2832831 the uks was the first real national anthem in 1745 and it was adopted by dozens of other countries sweden germany even russia at one point the idea developed that it was only the words that were important in expressing national character the tune to god save the queen was seen as meaning national anthem and the words were what made it appropriate to each country
2832832 countries use anthems to put themselves on the world stage

2832837 the nature of the fire itself is probably on a little bit on the suspicious side there is the potential that it could have been accidental but obviously investigations will confirm whether that is the case
2832838 i dont know if mama was right or if it was lieutenant dan i dont know if we all have a destiny or if were all just floatin around accidental like on a breeze but i think maybe its both maybe both is happenin at the same time

2832846 i think its just a matter of him getting comfortable being back on the mound and getting that last inch of extension
2832847 he said he felt better than he did friday night and in his last bullpen
2832848 some of the velocity could be timing when you throw as hard as he does but he also has to get the trust back subconsciously any time you come back from an arm injury you go through that the other night his split was probably better than its been all year and he was able to put the ball where he wanted he had enough to get guys out
2832849 hes a guy you can trust stuff like that happens its how you respond and come back
2832850 we did that with mariano rivera in new york he struggled at times when we gave him the role from former dodger john wetteland i looked into his eyes and said youre going to keep getting the ball
2832851 i have no reservations with broxtons makeup he has the equipment to be a closer if anything he may go over the top and try to overthrow the ball once he trusts his splitter he could be devastating he reminds me a little of don mcmahon a big guy who throws hard and doesnt say much

2832857 we never put any money in the collecting box when we went in over the fence all those years ago so we were a bit worried about owning up

2832859 when i first clapped eyes on bruce who has become the real star of the exhibition i never thought that we would find out who had created him and his bogle brothers
2832860 i have always assumed that it must have been students and would any students from the 1960s remember much about their time at university
2832861 the 60s were the era of painting stonehenge with rag slogans if only the other rag stunters had been as considerate as this lot it was all done with such care its just a pity the custodians of the time didnt have more of a sense of humour and perhaps then they wouldnt have consigned the majority of the bogles to the flames

2832866 do you think i deserve that if you think i do then i like the idea
2832867 a person can only be born in one place however he may die several times elsewhere in the exiles and prisons and in a homeland transformed by the occupation and oppression into a nightmare poetry is perhaps what teaches us to nurture the charming illusion how to be reborn out of ourselves over and over again and use words to construct a better world a fictitious world that enables us to sign a pact for a permanent and comprehensive peace with life
2832868 across the retailing sectors we are seeing established retailers with significant marketing budgets fail to make an impact in internet search they are still failing to understand how to market themselves online and as a result are losing significant revenues to independent and internet savvy retailers
2832869 care homes can be such miserable places you sit there all day staring out the window with no one to talk to
2832870 i thought it would be lovely to give a home and family life to one or two people who would otherwise be sitting around there its nice for me too because at my age its handy to have someone to live with now every book that sells will help towards making a home for someone
2832871 ive always written it seems ive been writing for a hundred years
2832872 i started asking people if they wanted to move out of their care homes and live with me and ive had dozens of offers they are queuing up
2832873 in our view the recent correction in oil prices was overdue and softness awaits in the next 12 months
2832874 with the economy slowing and energy bills on the rise it is totally unacceptable that hard pressed businesses are left so open to exploitation by energy suppliers

2832878 the current system is not working bail is too easily granted frequently breached and improperly enforced

2832885 over 1 300 cancer patients have been left to die in the past 20 months because they were not deemed exceptional enough to receive cancer treatment on the nhs they will have been forced either to go without the life giving treatments or to pay privately for the top up drugs and risk having all their other care withdrawn
2832886 the nhs should be available to all who need it yet 1 300 cancer patients were denied the treatment that could have made all the difference to them thousands of cancer patients have been forced to plead for their lives
2832887 there are 2 3 million people diagnosed with diabetes and over half a million dont know they have it

2832889 a year ago it seemed reasonable to hope that the worst would be over by now
2832890 coal is the dirtiest and most inefficient fossil fuel there is
2832891 rbs is providing the financial means for companies to build unabated coal fired power stations and dig new coal mines all over the world yet still refuses to disclose full information on the fossil fuel projects it helps finance or to take any responsibility for the emissions that result
2832892 people are coming from all over the country to protest against the proposed new coal fired power station at kingsnorth if rbs and the other banks dont stop financing such climate trashing projects they risk a similar public backlash
2832893 most significant impact on climate change is the investment and lending decisions we make
2832894 banks have a duty to give the public a full disclosure about fossil fuel financing so that account holders can choose whether they want their money to be used to support new coal projects like kingsnorth power station
2832895 we fund a balanced portfolio of generation assets that covers a spectrum from being the biggest funder of renewable generation projects globally to also supporting the oil sector which supports 300 000 jobs in the uk and our generation sector on which the uk depends

2832902 there is an appalling level of endemic homophobia in liverpool
2832903 given the level of homophobic crime that there is in this country it is tragically not surprising that this is still happening
2832904 shows that people avoid public affection talk differently dress differently avoid certain areas avoid public transport to minimise risk without this behaviour it is likely the rate of attacks would be far greater
2832905 when rhys jones was killed there was uproar in all quarters but when another young lad in the city has been viciously attacked and dies as a result the only uproar is coming from the lgbt community
2832906 we are looking at ways of dealing with the issue no decisions have yet been taken
2832907 britain faces yet more confusion on the back of this new speculation about the governments plans if gordon brown had acted prudently and put money aside for a rainy day during the good years as all our competitors did he wouldnt be floundering now floating all sorts of ideas that he doesnt know how to pay for clearly the government has learnt nothing from the damage done by speculation on stamp duty changes
2832908 a uk bill of rights and freedoms would be a constitutional landmark it would provide a framework both for protecting the liberty of the individual against the intrusion of state power and for protecting the little person against powerful interests
2832909 the popular misconception that human rights are a charter for criminals and terrorism
2832910 if we get to a four degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase
2832911 the need to belong in groups is paramount to young learners and exclusion is something they see as the end of the world
2832912 bullying of this kind can be quite insidious it can just be a look that a child is given children feel under immense pressure to look right and having the key brands is part of that
2832913 young people are image conscious and a lot of bullying is based on appearance targeting others for not having the right look accessory or brand is unfortunately all too common but it is precisely the sort of behaviour beatbullying can help change
2832914 advertising and marketing have made our society increasingly image conscious and our children are suffering the consequences
2832915 the practice is important to check on errant markers but not if it can only have one result
2832916 every year if people are pushed above the threshold it can have a knock on effect the next year
2832917 since 1982 both the pass rate and percentage of a levels awarded a grades has gone up year by year you have to ask why this is happening almost certainly it is because pupils work harder teachers have honed up on their skills theres been structural change with curriculum 2000 and changes to the syllabuses but there has to be a contribution to this gradual change from the change in what is considered acceptable for an a grade or pass
2832918 if youre going to look at the borderline marks youve got to look at either side of the border if you look at either side then its a useful process to check that pupils are getting the right marks but not if they can only move marks upwards
2832919 we require awarding bodies to have quality assurance procedures in place to ensure that candidates get the grade that their work deserves there are a range of quality assurance procedures that awarding bodies can employ the most important thing is that students get the correct results
2832920 young people are missing out they are doing better than ever in science tests at 14 but hardly any are going on to study triple science at gcse despite the opportunities and learning it offers
2832921 it is essential that all our children have the chance of the best possible science education if they are to enjoy the employment opportunities of the future
2832922 im aware that researchers from the university of southampton have applied to plant some gm poplar on our land were still considering their request but havent given a definitive answer
2832923 our concerns with gm trees are even more serious than crops because trees are very long lived they are inherently geared up for spreading seeds and pollen because of the way they reproduce theres a huge potential for cross pollination it could have a really negative impact and cause widespread ecological damage
2832924 distract from the real solutions that we all know we have
2832925 if we establish that a nuisance or pest problem does exist we may have to reconsider further action
2832926 we are surrounded by huge trees and the area is swarming with bird life
2832927 we are a country village and more than 90 of the people here feed birds
2832928 we would encourage people to feed their garden birds throughout the year providing birds with supplementary food brings them closer so that we can marvel at their exciting behaviour and wonderful colours
2832929 it was a silent witness not only to the battle but to the burials the dedication of the cemetery the reunions and everything that has happened since
2832930 when you lose a witness tree that you know was here at the time of the civil war you are losing a living part of the battlefield its sad but nothing lasts forever
2832931 not even the tender mercies of rosy nostalgia can render it watchable
2832932 as a us serviceman he was in charge of martialling photographic evidence at the nuremberg trial
2832933 may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children
2832934 why not simply ban these colours we know they affect children and serve no useful purpose in our food
2832935 omg its the dream of my life to ride in a blimp
2832936 oh i dont know a lot of things life is hungry i guess and its eating me up
2832937 you are going to be very tough to eat and thats a good thing
2832938 when you are ready to tell me about it you will because it helps to just say what it is out loud just to say it
2832939 you know i didnt understand a lot of what people were saying today what were they going on about it was all about something that was obvious but i just couldnt make out what was so important to everybody and on days like that i go back and forth with myself about why i come to meeting at all and should i come and why bother but i come because there are people here who are important to me who have a presence who i just like to see and know they are here and you have that presence
2832940 and i am hanging on to that so i keep coming
2832941 i feel that youve done a complete 180 degree turn from where you were your epr is going to reflect it and i also feel that you are now ready and have been recommended for the next e 6 promotion

2832960 puffy sells second only to ralph in many of our stores
2832961 some of that is because of his name of course but his clothes are actually quite wonderful and you would be amazed to see how many types of people wear them
2832962 puffy is so wonderfully over the top and flamboyant and god do we need that in our business
2832963 fashion goes through severely dull periods and we must have relief puff provides it
2832964 hes a fashion mini me half the talent half the glamour just as demanding

2832971 from my manicure to my pedicure from my head to my toe its the swagger that i show the world its my face baby its my walk my attitude
2832972 fashion is about leaving on your jacket and tie when other people are too hot to bother
2832973 details baby its all about the details look at the arm the ring the watch look at my canary yellow diamond impeccable admit it i am impeccable
2832974 this is all off the record its off the record
2832975 i dont want this off the record ive got a lot of shit to say about fashion it dont really matter what you write about me because ill still be a fashion god no matter what
2832976 look at the way it glistens i am a damn fashionable motherfucker and im not ashamed to admit it
2832977 they say he was the fliest man around but he died when i was three i saw a couple pictures of him and that was all
2832978 he came home one day and told me he wanted to start a paper route
2832979 that is how he started he always wanted to work and make his money we had a cadillac car and a house and he liked life like that
2832980 of course he loves clothes i do too i always made things nice in my house im a fashionable type person my husband was a fantastic dresser it seems to have worn off
2832981 a person works day and night just to educate a kid and to be able to have a roof over your head and a school uniform he was a fine student and when he left college it was hard for me
2832982 nearly every black man faces an unacceptable level of violence in this society im not different money can shield you it can protect you but it doesnt make you white

2832985 when you look at what they have accomplished its magnificent
2832986 you can see him shift away from the aspirational approach of the nineties he is not a great rapper or even a great producer but he goes out and scoops up new beats and talent in clothes he seems to be doing the same thing he is a mogul and he is moving with the market
2832987 the thing i love about puff is that he comes back
2832988 fashion was dull dead i thought maybe we could bring in some life
2832989 i thought whoa what did i need with a celebrity cat who wanted to start yet another label but the more i talked to him the more i realized he was completely able to do this he is totally involved yet willing to let people do their jobs
2832990 loves clothing very stylish and has a bit of disposable income not for a teen ager but for a man who aspires to wear gucci one day and prada one day and to be able to afford the custom zegna suits now down the road we will try to develop a life style brand thats the goal
2832991 there is this clear dialectic its sort of like jazz
2832992 white designers forever would go to 125th street to see what was happening that is where they got their inspiration their cool then the blacks turned that upside down they took the icons of the rich and suburban and blasted them this is when sweatshirts with the word harvard printed on them a hundred times emerged the ghetto was making fun of the suburbs and if the suburbs were about mercedeses then the kids in the ghetto would wear a necklace with the word mercedes in block capitals
2832993 he threw bling bling out the window and sent out a low key gorgeous ready to wear collection this stuff could stand up to anything anywhere in the world today
2832994 i just got an e mail from this writer who asked me who i thought mattered in mens clothes these days
2832995 i said the only man who is doing anything important is puff daddy right now he is all we got
2832996 if we could just tell him the number in french maybe he would have it

2833001 i hate rich people who complain about how tough it is being rich they are insane i pay like fifty per cent taxes and i am very proud of that i would happily pay more
2833002 its different from music i dont mix the two what i do mix is life style i am making a life style and its part of entertainment this just seems to be an obvious expression of who i am
2833003 does the clothing line need to make money for you to be satisfied with it
2833004 i want people to know how serious we are and what we are capable of doing and i want to be known as a businessman who made something better made my people happy and had some fun

2833012 we wanted to come up with something more representative of what is out there beyond some of the more popular social networks its one thing to have a lot of discussions about participating in social media or why you need to be on facebook but its much more extensive than most people think
2833013 thats the main goal of what were doing here in the planning department
2833014 our long range land plans call for dispersement of development in that kind of pattern where basic services are available close to where people live
2833015 that is directed at producing imminent lawless action and is likely to produce such action

2833017 the fact that deputy tollison took his closed fist and struck the suspect in the face 13 times in my opinion was excessive
2833018 then they have the audacity to treat this man as if hes a piece of meat and taser him with electrical jolts to his body and then thats not enough

2833037 i felt like i want to work with ben stiller and jack black but my way into the movie is ive got to be tarred and feathered for three months and maybe have my reputation destroyed that was my fear
2833038 then we started doing make up tests and it was like mr potato face can we take that wig off and put these teeth in now put this on now put that on but by the time we were finally in rehearsals i knew i had it

2833044 the climate in california intoxicated me when i first arrived there
2833045 it was amazing to me that these people had their own tree but they didnt even bother to pick their own fruit theyd rather drive in their car to a grocery store and buy fruit
2833046 i started to think wow i can eat an orange thats grown here so we started with growing oranges and now i have 120 different varieties of fruiting plants i just went crazy with it
2833047 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
2833048 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2833049 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation
2833050 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honoured to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
2833051 my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
2833052 he couldnt have been a nicer guy he just seemed like a real family man and just a nice guy on the set just very kind of normal guy
2833053 i stayed a whole weekend on the street we panhandled we made a sign

2833069 there was a bit of a headwind and no heat that was a blessing i dont mind everybody has to run in it cool weather and i can adjust to it
2833070 charles allie and i have been competing against each other for at least a dozen years and hes a tough competitor
2833071 usually hes a little stronger but hes been concentrating on the 400m hes tough and the difference is he had to run two rounds in the quarter and that had to take something out of him
2833072 you cant be wishy washy youve got to go with conviction and it panned out i cant believe it i had never won a 1 500m race before not even in high school i came to the national championships wanting two golds i got a silver in the 800 meters yesterday but i wanted the 1 500 its been a long time coming and this means a lot
2833073 i look forward to winning in my new group the benefit of masters track is that competitors look forward to getting older every five years in order to be at the young point of their next age group

2833080 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
2833081 cool did you make it how do you do that
2833082 they seemed a little bit disinterested during parts of the game
2833083 we used that to our advantage and when they were arguing with each other we were off on the lead
2833084 im more than happy i did tell them during the week do it in your own time
2833085 i will give it away to any kid that wants to buy a toy
2833086 i guess is better to give it to someone that really need it like a homeless guy or something like that

2833093 im aware that researchers from the university of southampton have applied to plant some gm poplar on our land were still considering their request but havent given a definitive answer
2833094 our concerns with gm trees are even more serious than crops because trees are very long lived they are inherently geared up for spreading seeds and pollen because of the way they reproduce theres a huge potential for cross pollination it could have a really negative impact and cause widespread ecological damage
2833095 distract from the real solutions that we all know we have
2833096 the need to belong in groups is paramount to young learners and exclusion is something they see as the end of the world
2833097 bullying of this kind can be quite insidious it can just be a look that a child is given children feel under immense pressure to look right and having the key brands is part of that
2833098 young people are image conscious and a lot of bullying is based on appearance targeting others for not having the right look accessory or brand is unfortunately all too common but it is precisely the sort of behaviour beatbullying can help change
2833099 advertising and marketing have made our society increasingly image conscious and our children are suffering the consequences

2833107 the woman follows the man in her youth she follows her father and elder brother when married she follows her husband when her husband is dead she follows her son

2833113 britain faces yet more confusion on the back of this new speculation about the governments plans if gordon brown had acted prudently and put money aside for a rainy day during the good years as all our competitors did he wouldnt be floundering now floating all sorts of ideas that he doesnt know how to pay for clearly the government has learnt nothing from the damage done by speculation on stamp duty changes
2833114 young people are missing out they are doing better than ever in science tests at 14 but hardly any are going on to study triple science at gcse despite the opportunities and learning it offers

2833121 the current system is not working bail is too easily granted frequently breached and improperly enforced
2833122 public confidence is undermined when bail conditions are routinely breached offenders hold the criminal justice system in contempt and new victims of crime are created unnecessarily it is time to tighten the bail laws and put public safety first

2833125 there is an appalling level of endemic homophobia in liverpool
2833126 given the level of homophobic crime that there is in this country it is tragically not surprising that this is still happening
2833127 shows that people avoid public affection talk differently dress differently avoid certain areas avoid public transport to minimise risk without this behaviour it is likely the rate of attacks would be far greater
2833128 when rhys jones was killed there was uproar in all quarters but when another young lad in the city has been viciously attacked and dies as a result the only uproar is coming from the lgbt community
2833129 if we establish that a nuisance or pest problem does exist we may have to reconsider further action
2833130 we are surrounded by huge trees and the area is swarming with bird life
2833131 we are a country village and more than 90 of the people here feed birds
2833132 we would encourage people to feed their garden birds throughout the year providing birds with supplementary food brings them closer so that we can marvel at their exciting behaviour and wonderful colours

2833135 it is an unfortunate fact that many domestic violence offenders are never convicted of a felony outdated or ineffective laws often treat domestic violence as a lesser offense plea bargains often result in misdemeanor convictions for what are really felony crimes
2833136 if its allowed to stand it certainly would be a significant problem for victims of domestic violence
2833137 they are typically the only witnesses to the abuse so to have to show by clear and convincing standard would certainly be challenging
2833138 if this ruling continues it would help truly battered people more because it would limit the resources that are being used on truly frivolous cases
2833139 youre going to have a chilling effect thats the bottom line
2833140 were very concerned about this because elevating the standard of proof will make it more difficult for victims of domestic violence who desperately need relief
2833141 the next time that victim is assaulted they may not come back to court because there were rebuffed

2833145 care homes can be such miserable places you sit there all day staring out the window with no one to talk to

2833147 ive always written it seems ive been writing for a hundred years
2833148 i started asking people if they wanted to move out of their care homes and live with me and ive had dozens of offers they are queuing up
2833149 neither senator john s mccain nor senator barack h obama have been particularly mindful of the budget deficit mccain has proposed to extend all of bushs first term tax cuts which expire in 2011 and add hundreds of billions of additional tax cuts mostly for business obama would allow only the tax cuts for the most affluent families making 250 000 or more to expire leaving the lions share in place and adding additional tax cuts for the working poor and middle class
2833150 the bush administration has spent heavily on the wars in iraq and afghanistan and faces a large budget shortfall in tax revenue because of bushs tax cuts and a souring economy

2833153 miller states that doj opposes changes which would expand its own authority to combat trafficking for example should they prosecute american tourists who create the demand for sex trafficking in foreign countries should congress provide increased penalties for americans who sexually abuse children abroad should american jurisdiction extend to americans who traffic human beings aboard should the attorney general include information in his annual report on his departments efforts to enforce anti trafficking laws against federal contractors and employees no it should not do any of these

2833221 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2833222 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2833223 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2833224 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2833225 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2833226 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2833227 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2833228 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2833229 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2833230 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2833231 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2833232 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2833233 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2833234 i wouldnt put money into the pocket of such a vile creature as piers morgan via the mirror and i aint going to via pg

2833237 theres a whiff of death about an industry that cant even sustain its own trade magazine
2833238 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2833239 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2833240 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2833241 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2833242 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2833243 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2833244 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2833245 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2833246 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2833247 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2833248 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2833249 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2833250 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2833251 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2833252 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2833253 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2833254 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2833255 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2833256 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2833257 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2833258 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2833259 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2833260 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2833261 pick up the phone and just call her what are you waiting for
2833262 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2833263 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2833264 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2833265 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2833266 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2833267 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2833268 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2833269 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2833270 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2833271 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

2833274 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2833275 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2833276 it is so simple i should have thought of it
2833277 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2833278 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2833279 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2833280 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

2833284 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2833285 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2833286 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2833287 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2833288 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2833289 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

2833307 the most significant show i have ever presented in over 40 years of television and radio
2833308 given the right show the move is a natural one
2833309 the only issues that weve ever had in the past and the only issue well have in the future especially with itv and probably with all broadcasters is that we are going to be squeezed and squeezed financially
2833310 theres no doubt about it two of the biggest shows on itv are our shows and theyre expensive shows
2833311 were never quite privy to what itv makes from the shows we make the shows for a certain sum of money they stick it on surrounded by adverts does the money they make from advertising pay for the programme
2833312 dont get me wrong our relationship with itv is fantastic especially with peter fincham there he used to be my boss
2833313 if wed have been found guilty of any misdemeanour from a production point of view i wouldnt be sitting here talking to you now
2833314 i dont think anyone tried to get away with anything for vindictive or manipulative reasons i think michael grade said that everyone just wanted to make a better programme but i dont think that stands up i dont think thats a good enough reason i do think there was a lot of sloppiness i think there were people not taking responsibility as soon as you ask the general public to vote on a particular issue and youve got millions of calls coming in and youve got a result you have to abide by the result you have to do that even if you dont like it
2833315 i dont think its reasonable to expect to find a leona lewis 2006s winner and the biggest star that the show has created every year
2833316 when you put two women together its either going to work very well or its not going to work at all
2833317 everyone knows that the relationship between her and dannii wasnt the warmest relationship
2833318 sharon didnt want to do the next series we wanted her to stay on without question but it was totally and utterly her choice
2833319 pay was part of the situation itv wouldnt cough up what she was demanding i think her demands were unreasonable from a financial point of view it was absolutely right to say that there was no more money
2833320 what was so good about cheryl is that she came from one of these shows girls aloud were the winners of popstars the rivals and has been very successful
2833321 hes great at pushing the envelope wanting more and more and more ninety per cent of the time what he wants is good for the show
2833322 by talking to him we have a lot of mutual respect ive been around a while made a few telly shows and he respects that he has an ambition and a view on pretty well everything especially the bigger picture hes most interested in getting the vision onscreen the biggest buzz he gets is the success when we did britains got talent he loved that we had seven programmes in the ratings and we took the top five places he gets the buzz from the tabloid coverage or getting a personal letter from gordon brown i think hed quite like to be prime minister for a while though i dont know if its the country wed all want to live in him and jeremy clarkson together thats his dream ticket
2833323 obviously the answer is yes but would it be as successful how important is he to the success of the show enormously
2833324 thats where i was when president kennedy was shot in the dressing room of the gang show
2833325 i worked there for six months and decided i was in the right business but the wrong bit theatre wasnt for me
2833326 the bbc have a slightly different attitude to it in that they ask if someone is a bbc artist they dont have a completely open mind theyre a bit blinkered and thats fascinating
2833327 we filled the whole of the o2 stadium the ground floor and all the seats to capacity for two days when you see the one side of old trafford completely packed its amazing and the hampden park turnout was phenomenal nearly 300 000 people applied for the show
2833328 we have had cases of contestants whove come in and weve looked at them and realised that they shouldnt go any further
2833329 we do tread a very narrow line but i would defend every single person thats gone on in terms of whether or not theyre mentally equipped to deal with it were responsible producers
2833330 someone went to kingswood warren saw a country estate near gatwick and decided it must be worth a packet
2833331 we want r amp d to operate closer with our colleagues so we can show how technology can help them and spark creative autonomy
2833332 were not slimming it down at all far from it the broadcast world is changing and will continue to change so the expectation is that the future media department will grow
2833333 the key thing is the quality and scope of work that staff can undertake thats what gets them out of bed every day hopefully that will get better
2833334 and major projects such as digital switchover will be in danger
2833335 its soul destroying for a group of people so dedicated to their work
2833336 the siemens deal broke that culture it was the demise of doing something because it is for the public good siemens do things for the good of siemens not for the good of the bbc or the public
2833337 this is an unacceptable way to manage a world class part of the bbc
2833338 there are only two centres in the world recognised as being leaders in the academic and industrial fields of research in broadcasting and they are nhk in japan and bbc r amp d in surrey soon there will be only one
2833339 politicians should be ready to say that private affairs are politically irrelevant
2833340 decide which media investigations are justified and which are not
2833341 unreservedly apologises both to him and to his family for making this distressing allegation and for breaching his privacy
2833342 sport is popular in wales and we see the cricket deal as an audience driver
2833343 there is big interest in glamorgan as the only welsh county club and we think it is a strong genre for us
2833344 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
2833345 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
2833346 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
2833347 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
2833348 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health
2833349 it is not a right to keep and carry any weapon in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose
2833350 it doesnt feel like a win because we should be doing better than that
2833351 we could have had one five minutes before and we didnt bother because it was sucking the life out of us on the bench that game
2833352 speaking to the lads on the st mirren bench they definitely thought it was a penalty
2833353 the rba is unlikely to miss the opportunity to nudge market expectations in an appropriate direction if it believes the market is getting carried away with either the size of the first rate cut or its potential timing
2833354 the adjustments the reserve bank makes to its growth and inflation forecast table are likely to provide clues to the rbas current view of how overly tight current monetary conditions have become
2833355 a continued weakening outlook for all the major seven economies

2833358 the snake was in front of us maneuvering a deadly attack
2833359 chief gave his two deep breaths and died he was fighting and saving his last ounces of breath to see a glimpse of his master for the last two seconds of his life
2833360 you think dogs will not be in heaven i tell you they will be there long before any of us
2833361 she has done everything this past year to leave no stone unturned to accomplish her goal of competing in the olympics shes found the best trainers the best supplements the best massage therapists whatever it took she found it and she got it and she went for it
2833362 the athletes who have sought us out are the ones that are looking for an edge
2833363 we can say hands down dara is the only u s olympics swimmer thats doing this
2833364 but it can be intense because were getting in there deep
2833365 shes got her own rubdown table three four people around her at all times and theyre pulling and theyre pushing and theyre rubbing its enough to make anyone jealous
2833366 but i think what youre seeing in general is more specializing by the athletes they are more catered to almost like professional athletes and thats where swimming is headed professionalizing itself
2833367 so you see more physical therapists more yoga and everyone has a masseuse these days so i think the stretching component that torres is using is the next logical step in terms of how far can we push the body
2833368 and at 41 maybe she needs a little bit more tlc to get her body to perform but shes also very genetically gifted and very motivated so when you put all those things together shes pushing the envelope and redefining what her body is able to accomplish at this stage in her career
2833369 she is one of the hardest workers youll ever meet
2833370 shes a competitor nonstop even if were stretching her and we say someones more flexible than her she gets all riled up
2833371 i thought it was incredible it was the best workout i had had
2833372 i was resisting hard i was dripping sweat and then i went and played a game of pickup basketball and i played the best game of my life
2833373 i dont think i talked to her the first two or three times working with her
2833374 i knew she was going to be first in everything she did and i have no doubt shed going to go faster

2833390 we were ready to attack i know with nine to go you get up on the wheel and push hard pushing and shoving is ok but that was crazy i guess there wasnt much place to go they kept pushing and shoving
2833391 im mad as hell about it but im not surprised
2833392 it seems that 11 months into the program with no major violations of safety and no accidents that this shows that mexican carriers are quite able to operate safely on our highways and follow our rules
2833393 this administration has been hell bent on opening up our border but over the past year has failed to show they can adequately inspect mexican carriers while also maintaining a robust u s safety inspection program
2833394 there is no reason to believe these problems will be addressed over the next two years the safety of the traveling public must come first before the administrations fantasies about free trade
2833395 well mr hayes whats it going to be tonight two three hours
2833396 care homes can be such miserable places you sit there all day staring out the window with no one to talk to
2833397 i thought it would be lovely to give a home and family life to one or two people who would otherwise be sitting around there its nice for me too because at my age its handy to have someone to live with now every book that sells will help towards making a home for someone
2833398 ive always written it seems ive been writing for a hundred years
2833399 i started asking people if they wanted to move out of their care homes and live with me and ive had dozens of offers they are queuing up

2833405 we never put any money in the collecting box when we went in over the fence all those years ago so we were a bit worried about owning up
2833406 when we were children dad always said to us if you cant be good be careful and if you cant be careful dont get caught
2833407 when i first clapped eyes on bruce who has become the real star of the exhibition i never thought that we would find out who had created him and his bogle brothers
2833408 i have always assumed that it must have been students and would any students from the 1960s remember much about their time at university
2833409 the 60s were the era of painting stonehenge with rag slogans if only the other rag stunters had been as considerate as this lot it was all done with such care its just a pity the custodians of the time didnt have more of a sense of humour and perhaps then they wouldnt have consigned the majority of the bogles to the flames

2833430 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2833431 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2833432 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2833436 thats really my definition of art arts only mission is to make people feel closer
2833437 the need for laughter and tears is so natural and so strong especially for people who live in dictatorships
2833438 their first need is the feeling of empathy to find someone with whom they can share their deeper feelings for those people maybe going and attending the tazieh can be a way of relating to these very deep emotions there is a natural tendency for laughing and crying in everyone but specifically in countries in which people are oppressed
2833439 he told me youre very lucky to live in a country where there is still such innocence
2833440 i said the day that you show all my films you can also show this you cant just choose this because you consider it something religious you can use in a different way
2833441 its been getting worse and worse none of my films have been shown for the past 10 years in iran and this is not just about me its not that they have a problem with what i do its that more generally they cannot accept independent films
2833442 of course i feel pain when i see that my country is considered evil
2833443 so in all my films my wish is to give a kinder and a warmer image of human beings and of my country every morning when i wake up i have to say hello to my neighbours and this is what i like to show in my films friendship love between people
2833444 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2833445 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2833446 with the economy slowing and energy bills on the rise it is totally unacceptable that hard pressed businesses are left so open to exploitation by energy suppliers
2833447 ofgems investigation into the industry must hold the suppliers to account over the very apparent lack of transparency and fairness in their dealings with business
2833448 across the retailing sectors we are seeing established retailers with significant marketing budgets fail to make an impact in internet search they are still failing to understand how to market themselves online and as a result are losing significant revenues to independent and internet savvy retailers

2833452 coal is the dirtiest and most inefficient fossil fuel there is
2833453 rbs is providing the financial means for companies to build unabated coal fired power stations and dig new coal mines all over the world yet still refuses to disclose full information on the fossil fuel projects it helps finance or to take any responsibility for the emissions that result
2833454 people are coming from all over the country to protest against the proposed new coal fired power station at kingsnorth if rbs and the other banks dont stop financing such climate trashing projects they risk a similar public backlash
2833455 most significant impact on climate change is the investment and lending decisions we make
2833456 banks have a duty to give the public a full disclosure about fossil fuel financing so that account holders can choose whether they want their money to be used to support new coal projects like kingsnorth power station
2833457 we fund a balanced portfolio of generation assets that covers a spectrum from being the biggest funder of renewable generation projects globally to also supporting the oil sector which supports 300 000 jobs in the uk and our generation sector on which the uk depends
2833458 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2833459 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2833460 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2833473 if they traders want they can be sent with army convoys in order to ensure their safety otherwise arrangements will be made to purchase their fruits by the police and the crpf and distribute them among schoolchildren to prevent any losses in case any damage is proved the fruit growers will be given compensation
2833474 dont go by the other srinagar muzaffarabad road it is not good for us and not good for you as well it does not help anybody
2833475 during our visit to both regions and after meeting people of different shades of opinion we found that nobody is in favour of any division of the state on regional or communal lines and that is appreciable

2833485 a major portion of the work on calculating the revised tax rates for nearly 1 36 lakh residential assessments in the city has been completed and we will issue the demand notices before the end of this month
2833486 the special notices would be self explanatory to help tax payers understand the calculation and make for complete transparency
2833487 it is an issue which needs to be sorted out we are going back to submit a report to the government for resolving the issue we believe there is a solution
2833488 we are aware that certain parties want to communalise the situation but our effort is to counter them
2833489 muslims of kashmir were an integral part of the amarnath yatra as it was muslims who discovered the holy cave it was muslims who maintained the holy cave and made arrangements for the pilgrimage
2833490 we should discuss all the demands and address the concerns of the people
2833491 some people are using the situation for petty interests to get a few seats
2833492 we have met district in charge minister shobha karandlaje and briefed her about our demands and a formal representation has been sent to the principal chief conservator of forests we have set august 15 as the deadline for the government to concede our demands if our demands are not met we will stage a symbolic protest
2833493 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2833494 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2833495 it is a hard game i think it is too early to feel anything i think god helped me today because it was a tough competition in the rain
2833496 i should have got a 25 in the fourth round this morning
2833497 this year has not been good for me you have to accept it to come out of it there is nothing much to analyse i have really worked very hard planned well and done all the right things it is difficult to have an average season and expect to shoot your best in the olympics
2833498 it was one bad round i dont know how it happened i have been struggling with a painful shoulder and possibly went back to my mistake a poor technique during that round if i had been in form i would have adjusted the gun was just not moving the target
2833499 i felt a bit nervous and disappointed but fourth is better than fifth
2833500 georgia launched a cruel cynical aggression against south ossetia our citizens died residents and peacekeepers
2833501 the form this aggression took is nothing less than genocide because georgia committed heaviest crimes civilians were torched sawed to pieces and rolled over by tanks
2833502 there should be no doubt that the operation to force georgia to peace will continue and the guilty ones will be brought to account
2833503 we have set a deadline for georgian forces to withdraw from the upper part of the kodori gorge
2833504 the larger purpose of the project apart from conveying to the people on how the meanings of some sanskrit words changed with history is to highlight the ancient indian knowledge encompassing nearly 65 fields like science music geography history religion astronomy and architecture
2833505 while planning this project katre clearly visualised that the scope of the dictionary would go much beyond the sanskrit woerterbuch dictionary in german prepared between 1852 and 1875 by otto von boehtlingk and rudolph roth which was published in seven volumes from st petersburg russia
2833506 it is gratifying to note that the published volumes of the dictionary have received excellent response from sanskrit scholars both in india and outside the country
2833507 the poona sanskrit dictionary which when completed will probably be the greatest work of lexicography the world has seen and true to this observation the work done so far has already drawn attention worldwide
2833508 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2833509 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2833510 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2833511 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding

2833522 if you prevent legitimate researchers from talking about their findings its not going to stop people from finding vulnerabilities its going to stop the good guys from talking about them and from learning from each other

2833573 but in recent years joann and her brother refinanced it several times for increasingly larger amounts the final refinance at the end of 2006 left the family owing 454 000 the monthly payments of 3 362 exceeded the household income of 3 144

2833579 emilio martinez a private investigator running for city council in watsonville said many latino borrowers came to him claiming they had been cheated by their mortgage brokers
2833580 but in reviewing the documents he found that in a majority of cases the incomes of the borrowers had been inflated to qualify for the loan one example a couple employed at a sandwich shop earning 35 360 bought a 628 000 home with 100 percent financing and no down payment
2833581 title companies usually dont make much news unless they collapse that happened july 29 when financial title closed 10 area offices
2833582 cameron park real estate broker john lockwood of elite properties gave two reasons one is the decline of refinancings lockwood said those are a mainstay of title company revenue but fewer owners are refinancing now that home values have sharply declined

2833585 this whole state is in a terrible mess financially cesar dias concedes as he prepares to board his repo home tours bus
2833586 indeed a walk around this once prosperous commuter town 130km north of san francisco is a frightening reminder that social destruction on a grand scale can happen in the blink of an eye even in suburban california all too quickly the city became vastly overdeveloped with so many empty houses and blocks of flats that the place started to feel like a ghost town
2833587 the level of overdevelopment is evident in stocktons run down marina area here the sheraton hotel the centrepiece of a regenerated waterfront quarter is in receivership and the luxury condominiums that were supposed to sell for 750 000 375 000 apiece are unfinished

2833591 a spokesman for monterra said the developer has not sold a single lot this year and if the properties held by mother lode bank are sold at auction a new market price may be set
2833592 this is obviously a concern said charles chrietzberg ceo of monterey county bank who is leading a consortium of banks that may secure monterras financial future
2833593 the unfinished mcallister ranch development is headed to the auction block aug 22 something that could make lehman commercial paper inc landlord of three square miles of dust curbs and an unkempt greg norman designed golf course in southwest bakersfield

2833595 the riverside developments are mcsweeney farms in hemet a 1 600 home project on 673 acres and the 3 683 home summerwind ranch community on about 2 590 acres in calimesa
2833596 the championship golf course was completed but never opened for public play the clubhouse was never finished in june large weeds sprouted from the greens

2833600 it is a rising trend unfortunately said dustin hobbs a spokesman with the california mortgage brokers association
2833601 surprisingly not all of these homeowners are in trouble some are perfectly capable to continue making payments said michael szakos a realtor with re max gold coast realtors but in these uncertain times people might want to reduce their costs by renting
2833602 some homeowners might be current on their mortgages but are tired of squeaking by every month while home values tumble others are on the brink of ruin

2833609 mark connal sales director for a builder in escondido said he can understand why lenders are freezing lines of credit and limiting new loans
2833610 similarly alan nevin director of economic research at marketpointe realty advisors based in san diego said a slowdown in lending is necessary
2833611 you cant go in and ask a bank of america to lend money in a situation where theres a substantial chance of them not being paid back nevin said

2833631 one example a couple employed at a sandwich shop earning 35 360 bought a 628 000 home

2833634 tried to turn in the keys to the lender and the lender wouldnt accept the keys
2833635 they dont just want a payment bailout they also want a price reset for the value of the loan

2833727 since 1982 both the pass rate and percentage of a levels awarded a grades has gone up year by year you have to ask why this is happening almost certainly it is because pupils work harder teachers have honed up on their skills theres been structural change with curriculum 2000 and changes to the syllabuses but there has to be a contribution to this gradual change from the change in what is considered acceptable for an a grade or pass
2833728 if youre going to look at the borderline marks youve got to look at either side of the border if you look at either side then its a useful process to check that pupils are getting the right marks but not if they can only move marks upwards

2833774 young people are missing out they are doing better than ever in science tests at 14 but hardly any are going on to study triple science at gcse despite the opportunities and learning it offers
2833775 it is essential that all our children have the chance of the best possible science education if they are to enjoy the employment opportunities of the future
2833776 the need to belong in groups is paramount to young learners and exclusion is something they see as the end of the world
2833777 bullying of this kind can be quite insidious it can just be a look that a child is given children feel under immense pressure to look right and having the key brands is part of that
2833778 young people are image conscious and a lot of bullying is based on appearance targeting others for not having the right look accessory or brand is unfortunately all too common but it is precisely the sort of behaviour beatbullying can help change
2833779 advertising and marketing have made our society increasingly image conscious and our children are suffering the consequences
2833780 the practice is important to check on errant markers but not if it can only have one result
2833781 every year if people are pushed above the threshold it can have a knock on effect the next year
2833782 since 1982 both the pass rate and percentage of a levels awarded a grades has gone up year by year you have to ask why this is happening almost certainly it is because pupils work harder teachers have honed up on their skills theres been structural change with curriculum 2000 and changes to the syllabuses but there has to be a contribution to this gradual change from the change in what is considered acceptable for an a grade or pass
2833783 if youre going to look at the borderline marks youve got to look at either side of the border if you look at either side then its a useful process to check that pupils are getting the right marks but not if they can only move marks upwards
2833784 we require awarding bodies to have quality assurance procedures in place to ensure that candidates get the grade that their work deserves there are a range of quality assurance procedures that awarding bodies can employ the most important thing is that students get the correct results

2833793 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2833794 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2833795 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2833796 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2833797 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2833798 its soooo amazing to me that i am living in your room
2833799 you wrote that article that was published in an actual book in the stores in the room i sleep in in the bed i sleep in
2833800 you have really strong energy and i can feel it in there and its telling me what i want to be
2833801 rich and famous i am going to meet a rich powerful man
2833802 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2833803 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2833804 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2833816 individual health care providers after consulting with current dod recommendations and fda guidance are free to exercise their clinical judgment in determining whether the potential risks of chantix are balanced by its potential benefits to their patients
2833817 if i can help someone stop smoking it is among the most beneficial health changes that i can help them make for their entire life
2833818 for many patients the risks to their health posed by continued exposure to tobacco may far exceed the potential risks posed by chantix
2833819 in the military community you can always find people you can relate to
2833820 it s so cool here everyone knows what you re going through
2833821 i had to pick my grades up he was only gone for like three months
2833822 i never knew it would be so different without him here
2833823 i liked the general s speech he understood everything we were trying to talk about
2833824 everybody is in the same situation the general talked about how his kids feel the same as we do even though he s higher ranking

2833831 banana cake you dont have to use too much sugar and if you use wholemeal flour you get a really delicious taste
2833832 one of my favourite things is to chop it up mash it with potatoes butter and pepper keep it simple then freeze it
2833833 when you freeze things the water content expands as it becomes ice so the structure is destroyed and it becomes mushy when it defrosts
2833834 dont spend 99 on this get a book out of the library
2833835 everything is symmetrical if theres three cans of diet coke hed throw one away rather than having three because it has to be an even number
2833836 its ok because soon i will be washing myself clean
2833837 would i want to put a cycle helmet over my hair i would look ridiculous
2833838 they only cost a couple of euros but they make anyone who dresses well such as me look absurd that yucky yellow ive got nothing to match it in my wardrobe what am i going to do
2833839 im very careful when i cycle so no i dont think looking ridiculous is worth it
2833840 ive spent ages gelling my hair im not going to ruin all that work thanks very much
2833841 ive only been cycling for four months and i try to be very careful but its true i run a risk not using a helmet its a risk im prepared to take
2833842 there is a great cultural difference between the english and the french
2833843 we are very very independent and very rebellious this is the home of liberty after all
2833844 it works but it looks rubbish so no ones going to steal it
2833845 a few years ago i was cycling at the porte de la villette when i saw a motorcyclist was run over by a car it was horrible i rang my wife and said im going to be late because im going to buy a helmet now i wont let my wife or my children go cycling without helmets
2833846 yes but it looks kind of cool with the advertising all over it
2833847 i feel happier wearing it now with all the v libbers around they are making the city more dangerous
2833848 the figures are clear three deaths in a year and 24m journeys on v lib bicycles that amounts to a 0 0000125 probability of killing yourself while using a v lib bicycle
2833849 thus one can well see that it is less dangerous to travel on a bicycle than on a motorbike on foot or by car
2833850 in northern europe especially in countries such as holland and denmark there is much more of a consensus that bicycles have priority in britain its much more of a war of all against all france is somewhere in between in britain our road environment is much more of a free market and that may make cyclists ride more quickly and aggressively than they do in the rest of europe
2833851 its a very bad example for the leader of a capital city to set
2833852 i have ended up giving offence to both opposing factions as soon as i started to wear a helmet i was denounced as a wimp as soon as i was pictured not wearing a helmet i was attacked for sending out the wrong signal
2833853 indeed the bicycle helmet research foundation estimates that the average cyclist would have to pedal the roads for more than 3 000 years to suffer a serious head injury let alone one that would be mitigated by a cycle helmet
2833854 research suggests that the mere donning of protective gear such as helmets encourages cyclists to take more risks on the road and therefore paradoxically increase their risk of serious injury
2833855 the probability of having an accident resulting in a serious head injury which could be mitigated by a helmet is mercifully low there are many kinds of high impact crashes where a helmet or any form of body protection would not save you but the issue is that if an unhelmeted child is involved in a non fatal crash resulting in a serious head injury there is a 50 to 70 chance it will result in a serious cognitive deficit it seems sensible that just as we immunise children against serious diseases they are very unlikely to catch we ensure they take precautions against the possibility of head injuries however rare the blase attitude of boris johnson and cycle campaigners on this point surprises me
2833856 while simple fractures to the skull can heal brain injuries unlike those to other body regions do not and can lead to long term consequences
2833857 a bicycle helmet is supposed to perform three functions namely
2833858 there is now a considerable amount of scientific evidence that bicycle helmets have been found to be effective at reducing head brain and upper facial injury in bicyclists
2833859 these three functions can be achieved by combining the properties of the soft crushable material usually polystyrene that is incorporated into helmets usually referred to as the liner and the outer surface of the helmet usually called the shell
2833860 their design intended strength is equivalent to a impact speed of about 12 5mph
2833861 they were never intended for collisions with cars theyre not a cycle equivalent of motorbike crash helmets and you cant wear one of those because your brain would boil they work by the outer shell keeping the polystyrene in place whilst it absorbs the deceleration by being crushed counter intuitively if the shell breaks in the initial contact the total energy absorbed is a lot less a broken helmet is one that didnt work
2833862 was that a behaviour intended to reduce risk putting on a bicycle helmet might paradoxically increase ones overall level of risk because drivers react to its presence by changing their behaviour

2833927 what they want is to make sure theres enough water for the future that they have a safe reliable supply and the sewage system works

2833929 coal is the dirtiest and most inefficient fossil fuel there is
2833930 rbs is providing the financial means for companies to build unabated coal fired power stations and dig new coal mines all over the world yet still refuses to disclose full information on the fossil fuel projects it helps finance or to take any responsibility for the emissions that result
2833931 people are coming from all over the country to protest against the proposed new coal fired power station at kingsnorth if rbs and the other banks dont stop financing such climate trashing projects they risk a similar public backlash
2833932 most significant impact on climate change is the investment and lending decisions we make
2833933 banks have a duty to give the public a full disclosure about fossil fuel financing so that account holders can choose whether they want their money to be used to support new coal projects like kingsnorth power station
2833934 we fund a balanced portfolio of generation assets that covers a spectrum from being the biggest funder of renewable generation projects globally to also supporting the oil sector which supports 300 000 jobs in the uk and our generation sector on which the uk depends

2833972 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2833973 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2833974 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2833975 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2833976 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2833977 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2833978 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2833979 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2834191 a year ago it seemed reasonable to hope that the worst would be over by now that has not turned out to be the case
2834192 most analysts are now suggesting that the economy will at best only manage to stagnate in the coming few quarters and that the growth prospects through 2009 and into 2010 look no better than anaemic
2834193 over 1 300 cancer patients have been left to die in the past 20 months because they were not deemed exceptional enough to receive cancer treatment on the nhs they will have been forced either to go without the life giving treatments or to pay privately for the top up drugs and risk having all their other care withdrawn
2834194 the nhs should be available to all who need it yet 1 300 cancer patients were denied the treatment that could have made all the difference to them thousands of cancer patients have been forced to plead for their lives
2834195 the current system is not working bail is too easily granted frequently breached and improperly enforced
2834196 public confidence is undermined when bail conditions are routinely breached offenders hold the criminal justice system in contempt and new victims of crime are created unnecessarily it is time to tighten the bail laws and put public safety first
2834197 a uk bill of rights and freedoms would be a constitutional landmark it would provide a framework both for protecting the liberty of the individual against the intrusion of state power and for protecting the little person against powerful interests
2834198 the popular misconception that human rights are a charter for criminals and terrorism
2834199 the best minds on the planet will soon be invited to submit ideas for the 10 000 home settlements planning new towns from scratch we can design the integrated transport and renewable energy systems that allow residents to live without negative impact on the environment
2834200 district heating networks with energy centres powered by bio mass and large scale turbines
2834201 solar panels were best installed en masse on flat roofs
2834202 they work most efficiently at a tilt angle of 30 40 degrees because of our latitude which makes the pitch of the average british roof eminently suitable
2834203 do something do something to that and then do something to that pretty soon youve got something
2834204 we are looking at ways of dealing with the issue no decisions have yet been taken
2834205 britain faces yet more confusion on the back of this new speculation about the governments plans if gordon brown had acted prudently and put money aside for a rainy day during the good years as all our competitors did he wouldnt be floundering now floating all sorts of ideas that he doesnt know how to pay for clearly the government has learnt nothing from the damage done by speculation on stamp duty changes
2834206 while such analysis is far from bullet proof the thrust of all responses was encouraging despite the macro backdrop
2834207 we accept that investor attention may be more focused on 2009 but again we are more confident than most
2834208 tui travel alone estimate that between 2007 and 2009 they are reducing uk capacity by around 750 000 packages and thomas cook will be a broadly similar number giving a total fall of around 1 5 million packages against demand which on highly pessimistic assumptions could fall by 1 3 million packages
2834209 following the recent reduced guidance from us peers we believe there is downside risk to consensus estimates
2834210 that said we believe this should be largely anticipated by the market
2834211 the company has continued to win contracts across all divisions during the first half of this year
2834212 we believe that the order book will be around 6bn for the group with the most rec ent win the new pfi project with john laing for the mod
2834213 widening growth potential by providing access to markets that move in different cycles
2834214 balfour beatty is very well placed to grow in its chosen markets
2834215 while the business is complex so too are the solutions the company provides we believe the groups core skills improving visibility and diversity of end markets add to its investment case
2834216 with scope to move in to a number of related infrastructure asset service areas the future looks bright
2834217 it is likely to give a positive view on the icm acquisition and reaffirm current year synergy savings of 1 7m with total synergies of 5 5m in the year to 31 march 2009
2834218 we retain our niggling reservations about the outlook for the mid market servo division which is diluting group operating profit margins but in our view the business continuity and partner division are both likely to be described as trading in line with management expectations
2834219 in this incident the positive and proactive initiative of the atc controller who on realising that mobile audio communication from the pilot was intermittent quickly switched to texting his instructions instead
2834220 my grandfather farmed with horses and i always said that if i had a place of my own i wanted to work it with horses
2834221 when we moved here some of our neighbors thought we were amish once the word got out that we were going to farm with horses some of the others probably thought we were crazy
2834222 some people have started to come around and ask what wed charge to cultivate their tobacco with the horses
2834223 with the price of gas i really think theres a growing interest in horses as a supplement to tractors
2834224 we sort of look at the farm as a small country and that we have to balance the exports and imports so that hopefully we come out on the positive side
2834225 we take organic sustenance away from the land when we produce cattle and hay but we try to put back just as much organic value as we take away and ideally put back even more
2834226 the pigs do a really good job of converting brushy areas
2834227 they kind of disc and cultivate the soil for us and we sow grass seed behind they as they go
2834228 theyre leaner and healthier because theyre eating what their bodies were designed for
2834229 when we lived in town we were both stressed out with our jobs always running around and always busy and never getting anywhere
2834230 there is a perception that while older barns may be interesting as historic artifacts they lack practical utility
2834231 kentucky has always been deeply rooted in a sense of place in its rural agricultural tradition and the barn is an iconic image of that
2834232 we still have this beautiful farmland how can we do every little bit to make farms as viable as possible
2834233 when the wizard of oz movie came out we would pretend that the winds had come and blown us away and we were up in the very top of the barn
2834234 in the business of barn preservation a barn has to have a job
2834235 if it has a job it will stay preserved or at least stabilize
2834236 anything that can be done to preserve this vanishing bit of life and culture should certainly be supported
2834237 we are using software update to make it easy and convenient for both mac and windows users to get the latest safari update from apple
2834238 how can something like this happen the idaho state board of education which oversees for profit colleges like canyon hasnt had the staff to enforce state rules that require schools like canyon to be registered with the state before handing out diplomas
2834239 seven sorry sisters the states with the worst regulation of private colleges
2834240 the sram team has done a great job building a global organization in an exciting industry
2834241 we have now achieved scale where we believe it is prudent to add an experienced institutional investor to our shareholder base we are very pleased that lbmb is committing its capital and expertise to sram
2834242 sram has grown to become a true leader in its industry without losing touch with its entrepreneurial roots and its core values
2834243 we are privileged to partner with stan day and the sram management team as they build on the companys strong momentum in the bicycle components market
2834244 bikes are a constructive transportation and recreational solution governments everywhere are recognizing their value to address traffic congestion environmental concerns health promotion and high gas costs the fund will support grass roots advocacy efforts focused on improving cycling infrastructure
2834245 we are pleased to see sram establishing the sram cycling advocacy fund which will give the industry a vehicle to highlight issues of importance to the cycling public
2834246 the belcourt holds 370 people as i learned in line two rows of folding chairs were placed in front of the front row of permanent seating
2834247 saw the park west show last night aug 8th excellent in all ways imaginable a solid two hour show to a packed and appreciative audience standing ovations for practically every song
2834248 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2834249 tu ignorancia es infinita si yo era franquista no quiero decir lo que t eras
2834250 se mataba a la gente a los curas y las monjas
2834251 eso falso eso es mentira y t lo sabes y si no lo sabes eres una ignorante
2834252 me has insultado me has llamado ignorante eso es insultar
2834253 el que estaba con franco eras t el que estaba en el opus dei eras t
2834254 decir eso no viene a cuento eso me parece una indecencia eres una franquista vergonzante
2834255 yo he sido del opus dei nunca lo he negado pero siendo del opus yo colaboraba como corresponsal en barcelona en el diario madrid ese peri dico lo cerr el gobierno de franco el madrid acab siendo hasta destruido visiblemente en la ciudad de madrid

2834258 they have attacks that let them load chosen content to a chosen location with chosen permissions
2834259 what this means is that almost any vulnerability in the browser is trivially exploitable
2834260 the nhs should be available to all who need it yet 1 300 cancer patients were denied the treatment that could have made all the difference to them this audit shows that the exceptional cases process is in chaos and patients are suffering
2834261 we urge the government to accept our 10 point plan to end this bizarre and demeaning lottery
2834262 hey uh youre real small gonna call you mini she heh heh
2834263 it was a silent witness not only to the battle but to the burials the dedication of the cemetery the reunions and everything that has happened since
2834264 when you lose a witness tree that you know was here at the time of the civil war you are losing a living part of the battlefield its sad but nothing lasts forever
2834265 the best minds on the planet will soon be invited to submit ideas for the 10 000 home settlements planning new towns from scratch we can design the integrated transport and renewable energy systems that allow residents to live without negative impact on the environment
2834266 district heating networks with energy centres powered by bio mass and large scale turbines

2834268 they work most efficiently at a tilt angle of 30 40 degrees because of our latitude which makes the pitch of the average british roof eminently suitable
2834269 coal is the dirtiest and most inefficient fossil fuel there is
2834270 rbs is providing the financial means for companies to build unabated coal fired power stations and dig new coal mines all over the world yet still refuses to disclose full information on the fossil fuel projects it helps finance or to take any responsibility for the emissions that result
2834271 people are coming from all over the country to protest against the proposed new coal fired power station at kingsnorth if rbs and the other banks dont stop financing such climate trashing projects they risk a similar public backlash
2834272 most significant impact on climate change is the investment and lending decisions we make
2834273 banks have a duty to give the public a full disclosure about fossil fuel financing so that account holders can choose whether they want their money to be used to support new coal projects like kingsnorth power station
2834274 we fund a balanced portfolio of generation assets that covers a spectrum from being the biggest funder of renewable generation projects globally to also supporting the oil sector which supports 300 000 jobs in the uk and our generation sector on which the uk depends
2834275 if we establish that a nuisance or pest problem does exist we may have to reconsider further action
2834276 we are surrounded by huge trees and the area is swarming with bird life
2834277 we are a country village and more than 90 of the people here feed birds
2834278 we would encourage people to feed their garden birds throughout the year providing birds with supplementary food brings them closer so that we can marvel at their exciting behaviour and wonderful colours
2834279 im aware that researchers from the university of southampton have applied to plant some gm poplar on our land were still considering their request but havent given a definitive answer
2834280 our concerns with gm trees are even more serious than crops because trees are very long lived they are inherently geared up for spreading seeds and pollen because of the way they reproduce theres a huge potential for cross pollination it could have a really negative impact and cause widespread ecological damage
2834281 distract from the real solutions that we all know we have
2834282 if we get to a four degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase
2834283 is it important to know what we believe as christians and why we believe it

2834285 subhanallah anak muda ini termasuk orang yang paling rusak dia suka minum minuman keras berzina makan riba durhaka kepada orang tuanya sehingga mereka mengusirnya dari rumah apa yang telah membawanya ke masjid
2834286 segala puji bagi allah yang telah memberikan petunjuk kepadamu beritahukanlah padaku bagaimana allah memberimu petunjuk
2834287 petunjuk yang aku dapatkan ini adalah atas jasa seorang syekh yang memberikan nasihat pada kami di diskotik
2834288 di lingkungan kami ada masjid kecil imamnya adalah seorang syekh yang sudah berusia lanjut
2834289 kemana orang orang apa yang terjadi dengan kebanyakan orang khususnya para pemuda mengapa mereka tak mau mendekati dan mengenal masjid
2834290 orang orang yang ditanya menjawab mereka berada di diskotik diskotik dan cafe cafe
2834291 salah seorang jamaah menjawab diskotik adalah ruangan besar yang di dalamnya ada panggung tinggi para wanita naik ke panggung itu dalam keadaan telanjang atau setengah telanjang sambil menari sementara orang orang di sekitarnya menonton mereka
2834292 seykh itupun berkata la haula wa la quwwata illa billah mari kita pergi ke diskotik itu untuk memberikan nasihat kepada mereka
2834293 para jamaah berkata kepadanya wahai syekh kemana anda anda mau memberikan nasihat kepada mereka di diskotik
2834294 para jamaah mencoba menghalangi syekh itu agar tidak kesana mereka memberitahukan bahwa ia hanya akan diejek dan dihina serta akan disakiti tapi syekh itu tetap bersikeras apa kita lebih baik daripada muhammad saw ia lalu memegang tangan salah satu jamaah untuk menunjukkan kepadanya lokasi diskotik itu
2834295 ketika mereka sampai disana pemilik diskotik itu bertanya apa yang kalian inginkan
2834296 pemilik diskotik tersebut terheran heran dan terus memandangi mereka tanpa mau memberi izin mereka mendesak agar diberi izin akhirnya mereka menyatakan bersedia membayar mahal senilai harga masuk untuk satu hari penuh pemilik diskotik tersebut setuju ia meminta mereka untuk datang esok harinya pada pertunjukkan pertama
2834297 esok harinya aku berada di diskotik itu tarian pun dimulai oleh seorang gadis ketika telah selesai tirai ditutup kemudian dibuka kembali tapi tiba tiba yang muncul adalah seorang syekh yang penuh wibawa tengah duduk di kursi ia memulai dengan membaca basmalah dan hamdalah lalu memuji allah membaca shalawat dan salam kepada rasulullah saw kemudian ia mulai memberikan nasihat kepada orang orang yang sedang tertegun heran mereka mengira itu merupakan bagian dari pertunjukkan lawak tapi manakala mereka sadar bahwa mereka benar benar tengah berada di hadapan seorang syekh yang memberikan nasihat mereka pun mulai mengejeknya serta menertawakannya keras keras syekh tidak menghiraukannya dan terus memberi ceramah dan nasihat sampai salah seorang peserta berdiri dan menyuruh orang orang diam
2834298 maka suasana tenang pun menyelimuti diskotik itu sampai sampai kami hanya mendengar suara syekh itu saja
2834299 the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil
2834300 thats the huge mistake that most people make that they dont see handling money as a spiritual issue
2834301 wants involve choices about the quality of good to be used while desires are the choices according to gods plan that can be made only out of surplus funds after all other obligations have been met
2834302 if you can perform routine maintenance and repair considerable expenses can be avoided
2834303 many people rationalize not doing these things on the basis that time is too valuable that is nonsense if every hour of the day is tied up in the pursuit of money as previously defined then youre in bondage
2834304 tablero de los sue os viii el testimonio de fhenix
2834305 this was a very good game tonight we made a few mistakes here and there but i am happy with the way my team played overall we are going to enjoy this moment
2834306 i believe that all of my players played well tonight and as a unit they were solid
2834307 we needed to win tonight we didnt have a choice about this so we needed to score goals we talked about it at the half and i told them they should be more relaxed
2834308 the pitch was really ruddy tonight and the rain didnt help things either
2834309 this field gets a lot of use and its always going to get cut up that and the humidity makes it difficult to play but its just something we have to get used to
2834310 the usa will be a tough opponent they are a very good team
2834311 die trag die in s dossetien zeigte die gefahr von zynismus und doppelstandards die leider einigen staaten eigen sind obwohl diese sich f r verantwortungsvolle mitglieder der internationalen gemeinschaft halten
2834312 erneut verhielt sich der westen seltsam in den ersten stunden nach der georgischen aggression hat er geschwiegen dann kritisierte er das russische vorgehen in s dossetien und zog dessen ziele in zweifel
2834313 wir m chten dass nicht nur russische panzer mit dem kommentar russland f hre einen krieg gegen georgien im westlichen fernsehen gezeigt werden h tte man das leiden des ossetischen volkes tote kinder und zerst rte ortschaften gezeigt so w re das eine objektive berichterstattung gewesen
2834314 this is true with a couple of interesting facts the college of western idaho is funded by tax dollars tvcc is funded with tuition and private enterprise with no tax dollars being used for the caldwell campus their classes with be geared to areas needed in the labor section first ones out of the gate will be welding which is already going on now a joint program with vallivue and tvcc fireman education and nursing are on the horizon tvcc has been going for several years at the mercado in caldwell by larry miller with over 1 500 students the college of western idaho is still struggling to get going and has had to scale back their efforts because they promised to use only a certain per centage of tax dollars they have found it very difficult to get buildings etc ready to go even with an initial infusion of several million dollars from the state to start they are a long ways from being viable the city has been working on tvcc for over 5 years tvcc has been slow to come around because they are an oregon institute and must stand on their own with funds etc in idaho they get no support from idaho tax dollars or from oregon thus they have been test driving the waters for the last several years and are now ready to proceed the biggest drawback we have as to having business locate here is our labor force so this will be a great boost for all i could go on and on but this is probably more than you want to know this is very positive and wont cost you money there is so much demand for this schooling that there is room for both schools and more oh yes the college of idaho is very much in favor of this happening if you want to know more email again and i will give you a call with the rest of the story the guardian is a spin paper that spins stuff to create readership most of it is not accurate or does not explain the whole story
2834315 we are not operating in any way which may counter israeli interests we have turned down many requests involving arms sales to georgia and the ones which have been approves have been duly scrutinized so far we have placed no limitations on the sale of protective measures
2834316 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
2834317 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
2834318 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
2834319 it was clear that too many unmistakable israeli systems in the possesion of the georgian army would be like a red cloth in the face of a raging bull as far as russia is concerned
2834320 and that the interception of three of these rpvs in the past three months was an expression of this anger not everyone in israel understood the sensitive nerve israel touched when it supplied such an advanced arms system to a country whose relations with russia are highly tense
2834321 we conducted a small job for them several years ago
2834322 the israeli is the main investor in the georgian economy everyone is there directly or indirectly
2834323 the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
2834324 we are now in a fight against the great russia
2834325 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own
2834326 its important that the entire world understands that what is happening in georgia now will affect the entire world order its not just georgias business but the entire worlds business
2834327 we need help from the un and from our friends headed by the united states and israel today georgia is in danger tomorrow all the democratic countries in the region and in the entire world will be in danger too
2834328 were mad as hell and we wont take it anymore
2834329 these issues are sectoral as opposed to cba specific and we reiterate our view that cba is likely better placed than its peers
2834330 we do not expect any great surprises and believe the stock price is more likely to react to 2008 09 guidance an update on the it transformation and any changes to the 2009 10 management objectives
2834331 we dont speculate on what the reserve bank might do about interest rates
2834332 but if interest rates were to fall then we would expect the banks to pass that on to mortgage holders
2834333 i dont think its in telstras interests to be seen to be the company which is still trying to implement workchoices
2834334 in a democracy if people want to be a member of a union then the unions got a right to represent them and companies should recognise that
2834335 everything we are doing is entirely consistent with labor party policy and the law including exploring employee collective agreements which would of course be subject to an employee vote
2834336 around half of australias top companies have employee collective agreements
2834337 then god gave these commandments as a guideline form them to follow people all these instructions
2834338 i am the lord your god who rescued you from the land of egypt the place of your slavery
2834339 you must not make for yourself an idol of any kind or an image of anything in the heavens or on the earth or in the sea
2834340 you must not bow down to them or worship them for i the lord your god am a jealous god who will not tolerate your affection for any other gods
2834341 but i lavish unfailing love for a thousand generations on those who love me and obey my commands
2834342 you must not misuse the name of the lord your god the lord will not let you go unpunished if you misuse his name
2834343 remember to observe the sabbath day by keeping it holy
2834344 you have six days each week for your ordinary work but the seventh day is a sabbath day of rest dedicated to the lord your god
2834345 honor your father and mother then you will live a long full life in the land the lord your god is giving you
2834346 you must not covet your neighbors house you must not covet your neighbors wife male or female servant ox or donkey or anything else that belongs to your neighbor

2834377 normally in drug design it would be 15 years from start to finish but because of the nature of the surface we have to split apart the way ahead is antibodies and that is very straightforward technology
2834378 so i would expect the drug development would be a lot faster
2834379 not only is this a very important protein involved in disease the structure shows immediately how we can design drugs to treat the disease

2834388 more than a billion pounds just in plant and machinery
2834389 people often talk about print and online as separate unrelated for our industry print and online are inseparable
2834390 a big part of the growth component of digital is down to the newspaper websites no question
2834391 because of the quality of the journalism that now sits on the digital platforms we are reaping the dividends of longer dwell time and attracting new readers its a virtuous circle as you would expect given that some sites lack depth quality and marquee names which is what newspaper journalism is all about
2834392 theres no question that we are operating in a very tough market
2834393 we are all familiar with the credit crunch headlines a clear tightening of consumer belts is impacting on business and ultimately through to media companies and the revenues that they get
2834394 you will almost certainly see a reversion to tried and trusted media as digital has proliferated there has been a lot of experimentation in the marketplace and some of it not particularly cost effective
2834395 there is always a pressure on media agencies to come up with ever stronger creative solutions and its a logical extension that as you see innovation some things work and some things dont there has been a lot of learning in the digital space in the last three years the good news is as media owners we are pushing more creative ideas that do work
2834396 retail is still very strong not least because of supermarket wars energy companies clearly have to lay out their case to the consumer and are doing so through press advertising and probably will do more interestingly the luxury goods sector is still going well
2834397 the market was going extremely well up until the turn of the year
2834398 we are in for a choppy ride for a minimum of a year and it could stretch into year two in such a tough market its up to us to make the case to clients of our proven medium one thats fast flexible and cost effective
2834399 some industry watchers have made the observation that were oversupplied in terms of newspaper penetration per capita we are in the top five of the world along with ireland and some of our newspaper businesses are not profitable i wouldnt like to comment on the reasons why their owners want to keep it that way
2834400 if the question is in such an adverse market would you contemplate newspaper closures then i dont have any visibility of that but businesses under extreme pressure will have to look to cover price or radical moves in their cost base
2834401 arguably some of the recent price rises have outstripped inflation raising price is a relatively easy button to press but its one that you would take a great deal of care in pressing not least because it can damage your sale the value for money delivered in each national newspaper given its cost base is tremendous and there are strong advocates that newspapers should be keeping up with the price of a cappuccino but we see very clearly that the elasticity of price is not finite
2834402 a national newspaper moving to free is an interesting concept but not a particularly practical one because it doesnt address the fundamental element of the free model which is an extremely lean cost base none of the paid fors come close to what would be required to create a national free newspaper the cost of content the cost of people they are not even close to what is required for a viable free model
2834403 it tells us where the opportunities are to market more aggressively to people outside our own franchises there are interesting crossovers there
2834404 none of the online revenues come close to the revenues that are currently generated by advertising and circulation revenue for newspapers its not a replacement model but it is a growing component of our revenue base it still needs to grow vigorously in order to contribute profits though current trends are ahead of industry averages
2834405 its very very tough to operate in a marketplace which is dominated by a state funded behemoth something of the size and scale of the bbc it makes it very difficult for players to grow in order to make online work you need critical mass the sort of people who make calculations about the profitability of a newspaper consumer versus an online consumer say you need to deliver very big audiences in order to make money online through conventional advertising
2834406 the bbc is impacting on every media their vast resources outstrip anything in the private sector you can see the impact it is having on regional newspapers the growth of video is going to be a very interesting area because it is the new booster of audience and their significant access to video is going to fuel their growth further i think the press industry view is that they have too much money and too much resource
2834407 the most important investment is our continued investment in journalism and that irrespective of genre broadsheet or tabloid sets us apart from other media and allows us to grow vigorously on different platforms including mobile which is probably a sleeping giant in terms of audience and revenue in the future
2834408 our ongoing challenge is to put our product in peoples hands every day before they leave for work whether that is subscription or whether that is doing more at retail or in home news delivery its about understanding how peoples lives have changed and modifying what we do to still allow them to take a newspaper in the three or four major cities in the uk we need to deliver much earlier than we currently do
2834409 it was intended to give a rounder view of life in kroo bay
2834410 it shows people getting on with life despite their problems we wanted our supporters to experience the lives of the people we work with and build up a connection my child plays football after school and so does the lad in kroo bay for example
2834411 were trying to get much deeper into the issues of the community if we were trying to shock people we wouldnt be showing the football team
2834412 it will be a community site that works like a human rights hub
2834413 where people can upload their own comments and come together around human rights themes
2834414 unsuscribeme gives you the opportunity to say no i dont want to be part of that reality
2834415 it is an incredibly powerful film and effectively demolishes the view that water boarding is not torture
2834416 i know this is probably a hard sell but that is never where weve been in our message and presentation this was done to recreate reality the primary motivator was not to shock but to report
2834417 phil this is ms x something big in books ms x this is phil hilton the editor of nuts magazine
2834418 no im sorry i refuse to talk to the editor of nuts
2834419 a lot of young women with very limited choices are being encouraged to see their bodies as their only passport to success encouraged to strip and conform to the look waxed tanned with big breasts its not a coincidence that this comes at a time of reduced social mobility
2834420 if i look at nuts i find it hard to believe that you produced it because i find it really unattractive it wasnt a good thing
2834421 of all the lads mags editors phil hilton appears the least at ease with his own magazine he squirms when i open nuts
2834422 they convey a sense that women are available they make it seem as though porn is coming true and that all women are gagging for it and that any minute all their clothes are going to fall off women are reduced to 24 hour a day shag bunnies i think the way porn is creeping into the mainstream of popular culture for young men is desensitising them
2834423 you were dissembling terribly you were giving the line a very well rehearsed dinner party line theres worse things than printing a load of tits but you didnt seem comfortable with it so what was the point you only get one life
2834424 you know that there are certain values and types of behaviour that unite the asian community in britain
2834425 the mentality that our parents brought with them a hard working law abiding entrepreneurial spirit is still very much shared by my generation and its my job to tap into that if anything i feel like we second generation british asians are really finding our feet in britain and feeling positive about who we are while everyone else is all doom and gloom and credit crunch were flourishing now more than ever and our music reflects that
2834426 part of the secret of any success that we have as a network is actually not thinking about being asian all the time i always tell the production guys that we should just concentrate on being real and the rest will follow naturally sometimes you can try too hard rather than just have faith in your instincts
2834427 very white and you knew the national front were an active presence
2834428 mum insisted that we stay in yardley and bottle it through
2834429 going from listening to people like john peel and pete tong on the radio to being a dj myself came easy to me
2834430 in my early career i would constantly be thinking about what i should be saying worrying about what would happen if people didnt like me saying this or that it takes a while to develop the confidence that allows you to speak without thinking sometimes
2834431 im very conscious of how hard it is for a lot of people to get into the media i want to do as much as possible to help those who havent had the chances ive had
2834432 the key is to work hard and know your strengths
2834433 actually people out there are interested in what a british muslim with a northern accent has to say
2834434 for the first 19 years of his life johnny razor wasnt johnny razor at all he was malcolm weatherly and he was born in mile end underground station on the night of 17 september 1940
2834435 our view counter to what you might expect our industry to argue is that conspicuous consumption is not productive and should be discouraged
2834436 i believe it is in the commercial interest of the bank that we should continue
2834437 its a rip off of that crappy seventies england shirt
2834438 mustve taken them about 10 minutes to think that one up thanks for nothing
2834439 its the biggest thing since jack charlton and italia 90
2834440 investigators believe umg is the conduit for lawson to reward nighbert for his assistance while serving as ktc secretary
2834441 business records correspondence and documentation may reveal that leonard lawson is the true owner or otherwise has control of umg
2834442 on some occasions rummage delivered the engineers estimates to nighbert but on others he gave them directly to lawson on four of these times lawson gave rummage 5 000 cash for a total of 20 000
2834443 given that lawson paid rummage for information that nighbert directed rummage to obtain and give to lawson investigators believe that lawson and nighbert had some arrangement whereby nighbert would be compensated when he left state government
2834444 through his political connections could assist in developing additional business
2834445 an advance for nighbert to purchase a car because the company did not want to purchase the car for liability reasons
2834446 marr admitted that nighbert had done no work for umg
2834447 it is simply not true that mr nighbert performed no work
2834448 mr nighbert has not done anything wrong and is guilty of nothing but trying to work and earn a living
2834449 investigators believe the agreement was generated after this investigation became known to officials
2834450 revealed no performance done by nighbert under the terms of this agreement
2834451 is in fact legitimate and prepared contemporaneous with lawful business discussions
2834452 nighbert introduced may to williams using terms that may worked with or for lawson
2834453 known bill nighbert for over a decade i have never known him to do anything illegal or unethical judgment should be reserved until the end of the judicial process
2834454 lawson was trying to build a bridge to the new administration by urging prather to install rummage as chief state highway engineer
2834455 nighbert told him that to succeed at the job you have to be friendly with leonard lawson
2834456 care homes can be such miserable places you sit there all day staring out the window with no one to talk to
2834457 i thought it would be lovely to give a home and family life to one or two people who would otherwise be sitting around there its nice for me too because at my age its handy to have someone to live with now every book that sells will help towards making a home for someone
2834458 ive always written it seems ive been writing for a hundred years
2834459 i started asking people if they wanted to move out of their care homes and live with me and ive had dozens of offers they are queuing up
2834460 but i remember the idea of it you can play in the sun as you please and have your toys but i cant you have a house and i have none you have celebrations but i have none why cant we play together
2834461 if you go on writing such poetry ill stop your father working in the quarry
2834462 i am a poet with a particular perspective on reality
2834463 gaza has won its independence from the west bank one people now have two states two prisons who dont greet each other we are dressed in executioners clothes
2834464 do you think i deserve that if you think i do then i like the idea
2834465 a person can only be born in one place however he may die several times elsewhere in the exiles and prisons and in a homeland transformed by the occupation and oppression into a nightmare poetry is perhaps what teaches us to nurture the charming illusion how to be reborn out of ourselves over and over again and use words to construct a better world a fictitious world that enables us to sign a pact for a permanent and comprehensive peace with life
2834466 i heard sir brian say he wants to give it to the ordinary people i think he was referring to gordon brown
2834467 his colleague suggested the extra cash could go to the needy but he replied no a fuel rebate for everybody on child benefit
2834468 britain faces yet more confusion on the back of this new speculation about the governments plans
2834469 if gordon brown had acted prudently and put money aside for a rainy day during the good years as all our competitors did he wouldnt be floundering now floating all sorts of ideas that he doesnt know how to pay for
2834470 the current system is not working bail is too easily granted frequently breached and improperly enforced
2834471 public confidence is undermined when bail conditions are routinely breached offenders hold the criminal justice system in contempt and new victims of crime are created unnecessarily it is time to tighten the bail laws
2834472 you need to have the food so that the audience can experience the mayhem and people are loving the fact that they feel part of the 13th episode
2834473 he sought the secrets of the pole but sees the secrets of god
2834474 a tree is male its buds are female its leaves are neuter
2834475 horses are sexless gods are male cats are female tomcats included
2834476 any language is a supreme achievement of a uniquely human collective genius as divine and endless a mystery as a living organism
2834477 id say im a linguist but id been struggling to get a handle on welsh until i started using a software package my husband is welsh and his parents speak it as their first language so i really wanted to be able to say at least a few words in their native tongue
2834478 id tried various books but was finding welsh a nightmare until a friend recommended rosetta stones software i was worried at first because im not very computer savvy but it uses pictures and sounds to guide you through various levels of the language without having to translate anything
2834479 its idiot proof when im in the study with the door shut the language just comes alive and i become totally immersed its totally different from teaching or learning a language in a classroom the programme also gives me the benefits of having a welsh speaker in the room without it being my husband who just takes the mickey
2834480 dyn dan awyren is the first welsh expression i used on my husband when he was standing outside looking at a low flying plane it means man under aeroplane perhaps you had to be there but it was so funny
2834481 before i met my partner isabelle two years ago my french was really very basic but since then its improved dramatically
2834482 my number one goal is being able to sit down with isabelles parents at christmas and have a proper conversation its nerve racking enough to meet your partners parents without having to worry about the language
2834483 svp parlez vous anglais which as everyone knows means please do you speak english i always find that it gets me out of trouble
2834484 i went to china in 2003 after id graduated to teach english at a university in ningbo a big city near shanghai
2834485 learning written mandarin the language spoken in most of china is as hard as it looks
2834486 speaking is a little bit easier and once you start to make an effort you pick up words quite quickly
2834487 i ended up staying for more than three years and marrying li li who is from ningbo we now live near manchester where i teach at a secondary school my year 8 class just won a british council prize for a mandarin play i taught them so i guess i ended up doing pretty well
2834488 ive been travelling to italy on holiday for five or six years but about a year ago i decided to make an effort to learn the language i found the best way for me was the michel thomas audio programme which ive now got on my ipod
2834489 ive always thought that evening classes were for people who cant decide if they want to learn pottery or basic weaving and by that i mean theyre for people who want a past time or social club classes just werent for me
2834490 id also tried lots of audio books but they can be so useless teaching pointless phases like oh look theres a donkey on the beach call me a taxi but this programme builds up structure in an unique way now my italian is pretty passable italian people gasp in surprise when i speak a little bit of italian simply because theyre so used to english people going there and just shouting loudly in english
2834491 i quite like lacqua fa ruggine which i think means water makes rust it refers to a preference for alcoholic drink rather than water
2834492 as my partner is from sweden i decided it would be a great opportunity to finally learn a second language id been learning the odd phrase here and there from my girlfriend until i heard about an evening class run by a swedish postgraduate student in the local bookshop
2834493 the classes were really relaxed with generally no more than two other students wed do exercises from textbooks and practise reading writing and speaking it was pretty much everything youd expect in a normal language course except in a more relaxed environment
2834494 the classes gave me enough basics to continue on my own and i can now hold a simple conversation in swedish later this month ill be moving there to study for a ma in politics although the course will be taught in english i hope that by the time i complete it i will have learnt a second language
2834495 we will take measures to declassify defence ministry documents that will permit free access to documentation inaccessible up to now and which has a high scientific and also of course sentimental value for many people
2834496 many of these documents are in the defence archives but we are not the only ones competent to decide what should be declassified or not
2834497 we know the solution will be complex and not particularly rapid but we are clear that we want to open up a new phase and achieve declassification for scientific historical and emotional reasons
2834498 he translated the pain of the palestinians in a magical way
2834499 he made us cry and made us happy and shook our emotions apart from being the poet of the palestinian wound which is hurting all arabs and all honest people in the world he is a master poet
2834500 this great figure whose poetry which reflects nostalgia and liberty speaks to us all
2834501 mahmoud darwish knew how to express the attachment of an entire people to its land and the absolute desire for peace his message which calls for coexistence will continue to resonate and will eventually be heard
2834502 the palestinian question in mahmoud darwishs poetry was no longer a legend but the story of people made of flesh blood and feelings
2834503 the voice of palestinian civilisation with its pains sadness and ambitions
2834504 he turned the palestinian cause into songs that transcended the cause and all other arab issues
2834505 today i have come bearing an olive branch and a freedom fighters gun do not let the olive branch fall from my hand
2834506 if thaksin really doesnt come back the conflict in our country will lessen which implies that our prolonged political trouble will come to an end soon

2834508 we have not ruled out every known species but we have looked at those species known to live in that area
2834509 there are so many reports of yeti like beasts across south and central asia that i would not be surprised if there are still some pockets of these very very rare and shy creatures
2834510 we would welcome more tourists but we dont want to lie to them in the name of the mande burung
2834511 i believe 100 per cent there is something i will not say it is mande burung because we have not found it but as long as there is no proof we will keep looking
2834512 there are many stories in our myths about elves or whatever but the mande burung is not part of that folklore
2834513 the creature was on the rock he was playing with a stone hitting it against the rock it was black
2834514 it was just a few seconds that i saw it i was very scared
2834515 we are not going to give up until we find it
2834516 you darent offer these people a house which costs less than 100m or they boot you out and not very politely
2834517 from tomorrow there will be a great meeting of our peoples to continue to deepen the process of change
2834518 you can really feel the change the right wing governors wont let him govern
2834519 the government is a satellite of hugo chavez and wants to impose a constitution that centralises destroys institutions and the economy
2834520 this government has not learnt how to govern and for that reason i ask the armed forces to overthrow the president
2834521 theyll remain deadlocked and each side will use it to become more deeply entrenched in their positions
2834522 we did it it was perfect its a dream come true i came over the line and i was just so happy there were so many emotions coming out at once i made so much noise because i guess thats the person i am
2834523 when i called them after the race it sounded like they had half the village in the house
2834524 we had our fingers crossed arms crossed everything crossed our son craig is in australia and we were keeping in touch via text when she crossed the line we went mad we spoke to her after the race and she was ecstatic we are so happy for her
2834525 im very excited it is such a fantastic achievement for nicole this was the ultimate goal for her
2834526 we had a lovely celebration in the village when she won the gold at the commonwealth games in manchester a few years ago and this will probably be a bigger party because its a long time since wales had an olympic gold medallist
2834527 she was about 10 and the first thing she said to me was that she wanted to be like sally hodge the welsh cyclist who almost became olympic champion well nicole has outdone sally
2834528 nicole was always a fighter she always had a look of grit and determination on her face come rain hail or snow she used to cycle the six miles to school and back every day
2834529 when i left the basement i saw that a tank had shot right into the side of the building thank god that no one was left there
2834530 i saw a car stopped in the middle of an intersection
2834531 inside the car were a mother father and their two children they were all dead shot by a tank
2834532 we live in the 21st century after all and we shouldnt stoop so low as to wage war
2834533 there should be no hatred between athletes and people in general well leave this to the politicians to figure out
2834534 if the world were to draw any lessons from what i did there would never be any wars
2834535 when it comes to sports we will always remain friends and nothing will affect our friendship even in such a scary event as shooting
2834536 we are friends indeed weve been shooting together for a long time we dont get mixed up in political things sport is beyond politics
2834537 we have our own point of view about what is going on but we think this is a matter for the un not the beijing olympics
2834538 if we need to we are ready to go back to georgia like soldiers but after the president has asked us to stay here we have to respect this
2834539 all of us here journalists officials competitors we are very nervous i dont know why the russians hate us nobody expected what has happened it has exploded for us the olympic games are second now
2834540 a man who issued orders to commit war crimes which resulted in thousands of deaths of peaceful civilians cannot be viewed by russia as a partner
2834541 we have started operations because we saw the georgian attack on south ossetia and knew abkhazia would be next
2834542 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2834543 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2834544 its no longer possible to listen to georgia talk about a peaceful solution in south ossetia or abkhazia or offer us autonomy georgia has shown its real face
2834545 you are coming with us to tskhinvali you are not going back i promise you
2834546 why do this why do this to us we are just ordinary people we havent harmed anyone
2834547 you can see nobody wanted to help us the un and the americans they all sat there while we got bombed it was the russians who saved us one more day and this whole place would no longer exist and nor would any of us
2834548 that is human flesh the georgians had not given us time to bury our dead when they attacked
2834549 there are volunteers here from all over the caucasus and russia
2834550 stop asking your questions i havent slept for six days
2834551 look at that the georgians fired the ammunition but it was provided by the british and the americans
2834552 he may be a good man as you say but the georgians are holding many of our good people
2834553 is the goal of the russian federation to change the leadership of georgia
2834554 the reasons cited by the russian authorities do not justify military action in georgia regardless of whether the action is taken in the province of south ossetia or in other parts of georgia
2834555 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2834556 i had a very uplifting experience going to a church

2834559 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire
2834560 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
2834561 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
2834562 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
2834563 conference at the johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory apl in laurel maryland
2834564 it has never before been necessary for any organisation to define a word that has been in common every day use so i see no reason why it was necessary on this occasion astronomers use adjectives such as giant and dwarf to describe different subclasses of objects like planets stars and galaxies so why could pluto not remain as a dwarf planet just as the planets we know now are outside our solar system but under the international astronomical unions definition they cannot be classed as planets

2834608 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2834609 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2834610 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2834611 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2834612 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2834613 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2834614 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2834615 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2834635 is your governments objective regime change in georgia the overthrow of the democratically elected government of georgia
2834636 id like to say straightaway that regime change is an american expression

2834655 it was great to do something like that to raise money for an amazing cause it was really killing two birds with one stone
2834656 the money will help people in financial crisis and go to client services and staffing costs
2834657 the service is free we encourage clients to partner with us and they can pay their money in to a budget account
2834658 we negotiate with creditors and try to get their interest stopped or reduced its great because clients are paying their debts with their own money

2834888 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2834889 is the lack of objective evidence for gods existence the foundation on which atheists rely for their conclusion that god does not exist
2834890 does there exist objective evidence that disproves gods existence on which atheists rely for their conclusion that god does not exist
2834891 and from julians brother aldous huxley also a noted atheist we have this revealing admission i had motives for not wanting the world to have a meaning consequently i assumed that it had none and was able without any difficulty to find satisfying reasons for this assumption for myself as no doubt for most of my contemporaries the philosophy of meaninglessness was essentially an instrument of liberation
2834892 as the statements of the two huxleys suggest the reason many atheists are drawn to deny god and especially the christian god is to avoid having to answer in the next life for their lack of moral restraint in this one the huxleys know that christianity places human action under the shadow of divine scrutiny and accountability christianity is a religion of love and forgiveness but this love and forgiveness are temporal and in a sense conditional christian forgiveness stops at the gates of hell and hell is an essential part of the christian scheme the point here is not that atheists do more evil than others but rather that atheism provides a hiding place for those who do not want to acknowledge and repent of their sins
2834893 for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth
2834894 therefore god gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves because they exchanged the truth about god for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the creator who is blessed forever amen
2834895 the atheist cant find god for the same reason that a thief cant find a police officer
2834896 we find the most terrible form of atheism not in the militant and passionate struggle against the idea of god himself but in the practical atheism of everyday living in indifference and torpor we often encounter these forms of atheism among those who are formally christians
2834897 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like it is not the gospel you believe but yourself
2834898 wherever we find the word of god surely preached and heard and the sacraments administered according to the institution of christ there it is not to be doubted is a church of god
2834899 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
2834900 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated

2834997 if they really love the characters then i would hope that this would make sense to them because these are the true characters
2834998 this is the story the way it was always meant to be
2834999 it doesnt always work out that way sometimes you make a decision about what you want and you pay for it and you suffer for it and it doesnt work out those types of stories always leave me horribly depressed im not going to live in a world for a year at a time where thats going to be the ending if people wanted a really depressing tragic ending i gave them a lot of hints that it wasnt going to be that way they really shouldnt have been surprised
2835000 i should have known that people would feel that way

2835009 i think they knew that history was being made tonight
2835010 obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it is for ours you could feel the electricity
2835011 the excitement of it the anxiousness of it the anticipation was just crazy
2835012 im kind of glad its out of the way now this game was just over the top
2835013 he basically came up to us and said im here to support you our country supports you and so go out there and kick some butt
2835014 so i think that it will be good for us
2835015 you just had to smile because you couldnt write it any better
2835016 things go easier you have more fun things flow better when youre having success im going to continue to just ride it out
2835017 you hear it all the time youve got to keep your mind in the moment
2835018 its easier said than done but its something youve got to be conscious of if you feel yourself thinking about the past or trying to think about the eighth inning in the fourth inning youre in trouble already
2835019 did a good job moving his fastball around made some adjustments as the game wore on overall another real good day for cliff
2835020 he always makes me look like i know what im doing
2835021 i can call any pitch and he can execute it
2835022 he attacks the hitters he goes out there and works the plate hes been doing it all year its fun to watch i hope he can continue this stretch and finish strong
2835023 felt good some at bats a little tardy on other ones
2835024 only one of us could make it over the wall

2835037 my teammates my girlfriend my family its just hard it really is i had a lot of people come out to watch me tonight they dont have a lot of money but they spent what they had to come here and watch and i still didnt win so i feel bad about that
2835038 thats hard to do were just trying to pick up the slack it was a good day all the way around
2835039 we said people have to step up today is a prime example that were capable of doing it
2835040 everything i threw was right over the middle of the plate early on especially in the first inning they were sitting on my slider thats definitely not the way i wanted to come back

2835047 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2835048 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2835049 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2835050 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2835051 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2835052 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2835053 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2835054 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2835055 im playing a killer im not going to give anything else away

2835061 knowing who im dating and what kind of cereal i eat aint gonna benefit anybody else that kind of thing is not important
2835062 people have different opinions on that type of thing i told you what mine is and i think for each person you do whats right for you for me part of the reason that i have anxiety is the fact that i feel like people are always staring at me so its important for me to make sure that i have my friends and vacation and what i do at home with my family and that type of thing stays private

2835074 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hard core family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2835075 one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have
2835076 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2835077 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather
2835078 i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
2835079 a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives
2835080 his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set
2835081 bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real
2835082 that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2835083 surprise n a it was bound to happen sooner or later
2835084 yeah i went green and 26s on the hybrid smoke so much green that i cant open up my eyelids
2835085 wake up in london go to sleep on atlanta time still my paint got more candy than your valentine
2835086 trouble i dont shy away from it i annihilate suckas in their driveway in church on sunday morning praying bout what happened friday

2835088 were in the works of doing a whole lot of very creative stuff
2835089 the whole album every song is a movie thats basically how it comes down i dont even have features on the album the first single is not even featuring chris brown and sean garrett its co starring chris brown and sean garrett thats what i have on this album its all stars basically its co starring people because its a movie every song is a movie creatively and conceptually i think people are definitely going to understand that this is something that was very creatively put together it took a minute but every song is very serious
2835090 the soulsville foundation which operates the stax museum of american soul music stax music academy and the soulsville charter school is so deeply saddened by the passing of isaac hayes that we are in state of shock
2835091 we found pictures that we really loved on the computer and then we put them on the shirts and then we started designing them
2835092 it was all worth it because we got to see the jonas brothers
2835093 it was horrible when we went to the train station there was rats outside the park people were shoving each other there were a lot of fights
2835094 we wanted to get the best seats and we wanted to have fun camping out
2835095 well we go to hear their new songs too which was amazing the jonas brothers are worth camping out for any day
2835096 they really put everything they can into their music and they really love their fans so they deserve it
2835097 theyre great inspirations to kids theyre a very wholesome band and they put everything they can into it
2835098 justice obviously was a huge record for us we took the ride the lightning and master of puppets concept as far as we could take it
2835099 there was no place else to go with the progressive nutty sideways side of metallica and im so proud of the fact that in some way that album is kind of the epitome of that progressive side of us up through the 80s
2835100 theres a certain kind of specific sound to that record peculiar sound whichever adverb you want to choose thats given it a kind of life of its own and a little bit of a vibe all its own there have been a lot of great musicians we admire whove come up and talked about what a great inspiration that album has been to them and to their sound its obviously awesome to be part of that that album also sent us on this whole other merry way because when we came back from touring on that record in 1989 we were like we have nothing more to offer on this side of metallica and that set us off on some other adventures when i think of the nine records weve put out its impossible for me to think of the music without thinking of the experience and when i think of the experience i have warm and fuzzy feelings but i also have questions obviously justice is well revered especially among a lot of our peers
2835101 that album songwriting wise it was just us really showing off and trying to show what we could do
2835102 weve jammed six riffs into one song lets make it eight lets go crazy with it i listen to some of that stuff and its pretty progressive sonically it has its shortcomings but that is the one where we were able to step forward from
2835103 we mixed that record while we were on the road
2835104 thats not an excuse for the way that it sounds but our ears were beat anywhere i go whenever i ask someone what their favorite record is someones bound to say justice its pretty great that across the line someone can jump into your history and feel comfortable
2835105 id have to go song by song i was just listening to 1997s reload and there are a couple of songs on there that i think are absolutely brilliant but as an album itself and as a time justice just isnt a good memory for me but those songs are good i have to try and erase the memory of that experience somehow and let the songs take me
2835106 its always the next one i think the forthcoming is great but theres always a better something the holy grail of guitar sounds i havent got there yet but i will on the next one ill write the ultimate song on the next one the hunger is always there to do it better
2835107 i dont have an excuse i just need a little help
2835108 due to various reasons it wasnt working out with us and him
2835109 we felt his heart was no longer in it after expressing his want to leave on numerous occasions this year which showed when he played live
2835110 asked me to hold his staff so that he could jump on my old trampoline i just stood there watching him trying not to think about the fact he wasnt wearing any underoos
2835111 the leaf is yellow now again what color is this leaf
2835112 this fucking leaf is fucking yellow what color is the yellow fucking leaf
2835113 it doesnt matter what you think the color of the leaf is whether you think it or speak it the fact is it will still be green
2835114 it doesnt matter what you think about yourself the fact remains that what you see isnt always what we see just because you dont see yourself as important and beautiful in some way doesnt mean other people cant spot it
2835115 that was the first question i had when i came in for the job interview
2835116 all most people know about belmont is that it was supposedly so toxic
2835117 and that it was very costly people i meet tell me they thought it was demolished that it was never going to be
2835118 school safety is going to be a concern the gases and stuff
2835119 the names of the things on top of the lights
2835120 can the school be operated safely yes but it also has to be monitored and maintained for the life of the school without failure thats the biggest concern many people have had that over time people would become less concerned and think less about the purpose of the system
2835121 this is incredibly serious because it could have led to loss of life its chilling
2835122 people are concerned about their safety but that is not affecting their work they are going to continue doing the research
2835123 this is the first attack on animal researchers we are aware of where there were children in the home
2835124 uc santa cruz may consider themselves an institution of higher education but they are also an institution of animal torture and killing
2835125 its regrettable that certain scientists are willing to put their families at risk by choosing to do wasteful animal experiments in this day and age
2835126 said shama 22 a marine corps veteran who served in ramadi iraq and is now an intern at the jerusalem funds palestine center in washington d c hes working toward a degree in international relations with the dream of working in the u s state department office of middle eastern affairs
2835127 when it comes to the quran im sure it says youre not supposed to wage war against others of the same religion
2835128 in ramadi iraq we were fighting al qaeda and al qaeda every day in the news at the time they were blowing up a mosque killing muslims and women and children to me i wasnt fighting against muslims i was fighting against extremists who had taken the religion
2835129 there were times we were going in places where instead of it having to be an ugly situation where marines dont speak arabic telling them to move from room to room instead i could speak to them
2835130 by the end of the day we were sitting there sipping tea with the iraqis in the house everybody is relaxing talking
2835131 i can never complain about being arabic and being in the military
2835132 because of the way my leaders have treated me i have nothing to complain about if anything being arab and being muslim in the military right now benefits a unit so much if anything it helps your career
2835133 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2835134 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2835135 obviously ive never been offered a film as a leading man but then again i do understand that there is still a perception of what a leading man should be i dont think the public in general is yet ready in england on television its not an issue it shouldnt be an issue it should be about your work and how good you are at your job
2835136 i got my artist tay dizm and ive already got his single beam me up featuring me and rick ross ive also got young cash coming out right now jay lyriq ive got a lot of stuff coming on my nappy boy label

2835139 if you wouldve come to my wedding you would have heard the records at my reception everybody was going crazy its this one record we got thats called talk that its phenomenal everybody is like you rapping like that i been doing that its nothing for me
2835140 that record i wont put on my lp cause its so much of a smash
2835141 its so phenomenal you would be like well why wouldnt you put it on your record if its so much of a smash because i would give it to my sister my sister needs that record more than i would need that my sister which is missy if missy had that record shes gone shes gone

2835160 he did the drills he did most of the individual drills well see
2835161 yeah hes coming along but we dont have to rush the guy we have a long time before the opener were not going to rush this kid at all hell be fine
2835162 hes a powerful man theres no doubt about that hes got a lot to learn he has pretty good instincts on the run hes going to have to improve his pass rush but they all do when theyre young
2835163 hes done a good job hes practicing well itll be interesting to see how he practices this week against brian waters hes been good and did some good things in the game too
2835164 sure they do they both do they were fairly high ranked picks we bring in another guy dorsey that was a really high pick they have to help us in the rotation because we want to rotate those defensive linemen wed like to dress seven or eight of them depending on special teams
2835165 they both have improved and have a lot of confidence now
2835166 yeah they came back good i anticipated that now tomorrow the next three days will be pads thats good and by thursday well be back in spiders pads and be ready to play
2835167 the thing about these guys is they generally rally when you ask them to do it in practice like i said before we started camp i didnt know most of these guys i didnt know how theyd react you have to figure out if you have a tough football team or not thats why we did what we did most teams are in one a days now you have to be careful you only have 80 players and you dont want them to get hurt
2835168 we need another guy stallings we dont know where hes out were thin and we needed to get some guys in there especially in the pre season since you cant play your starters so much your young guys have to play he was here in the spring and the numbers games got him
2835169 its not so much a problem but when a couple of guys get nicked you dont have the luxury of having 85 or 86 guys like you previously did with the world league exemptions the big thing is the quarterback situation only bringing in three quarterbacks you used to bring in four and some extra legs at receiver weve been pretty good so far weve held up with nine receivers in double days going one a days is going to help
2835170 hes a pretty heady kid hes going to improve both corners we drafted we liked theyre going to have the opportunity to play a lot for us we can anticipate that

2835205 hey check out those cows they are in the shade isnt that cute no no i guess its not is it

2835211 i am not saying this because i am in need for i have learned to be content whatever the circumstances i know what it is to be in need and i know what it is to have plenty i have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation whether well fed or hungry whether living in plenty or in want

2835243 initially it was invigorating people suddenly wanted to hear my views on all manner of social problems i was up for it but it palled very soon afterwards it was not like real conversation where you listen and learn its hard to learn anything when you are talking about it you only learn doing it and if you are not learning whats the point
2835244 its really about the sense of joy you have in having worked hard to imagine and discover and one hopes to create a world an illusion of a world that other people might believe in because you believe in it yourself a form of self delusion after achieving that it seems far crazier to jump in and out of that world that youve gone to such pains to create and it wouldnt be my wish to do that because i enjoy being in there

2835251 since it came about in the 1930s as nasas rocket research lab the jet propulsion laboratory has been a part of just about every major unmanned u s space mission to date jpl also has a somewhat surprising history of running major missions out of modular trailers scattered around their pasadena hq which are packed with all of the stuff you need to oh i dont know monitor a spacecraft on its way to mars photographer richard harrington stumbled upon one of these trailers abandoned on a dusty lot somewhere between l a and las vegas which as you would expect is retro space tech dream inside

2835256 do you ever wonder how communism could last for 70 years in russia surely there was plenty of evidence for decades that the system was failing food shortages declining life expectancy increased infant mortality low standards of living primitive hospitals and sanitation facilities lagging far behind those in western europe and america not to mention pollution far worse than in the west but to diehard communists the facts did not matter all the observable negatives of collectivism were trumped by ideology the same is true of the ideology behind global warming

2835258 insects store fat like mammals do as lipid droplets accumulated in the fat body the functional equivalent of both mammalian liver and white adipose tissue
2835259 drosophila share many components of fat biosynthesis degradation and regulation with humans including many of those implicated in diabetes and obesity
2835260 the healthy human mouth is home to a tremendous variety of microbes including viruses fungi protozoa and bacteria
2835261 the bacteria are the most numerous there are 100 million in every millilitre of saliva and more than 600 different species in the mouth around half of these have yet to be named and we are trying to describe and name the new species
2835262 interestingly this species was isolated from within the oral tissues both in oral cancers and normal healthy tissue
2835263 this confirms other work showing that oral bacteria can invade both tissues and individual cells
2835264 americans are a prudently cautious lot and it speaks well of them that many are reserving final judgment

2835280 i mean its like doug no one ever heard of a rock band with a doug in it
2835281 but at least it wont be because we dont have the means
2835282 it has been pressing since the end of last season
2835283 we like to operate with four strikers and we have not been able to do that
2835284 i cant answer the question because i dont have the right answer

2835287 it creates new union jobs including major growth areas like fios it takes a big step forward on health care and it brings hundreds of verizon business employees the union rights they deserve we applaud management for agreeing to keep the best health coverage in america and for their commitment to work with us for real health care reform this settlement provides a framework for growth at verizon and a good standard of living with careers for our members
2835288 this agreement is a tribute to the solidarity and activism of ibew and cwa members working at verizon

2835291 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
2835292 at this point in time we actually have 130 people in jefferson county alone locally here that are on dialysis
2835293 i do understand that its a big thing that i did but i really just see it as helping out a friend i mean i just helped out a friend
2835294 i was on it for four and a half years on dialysis you think its going to happen overnight but it doesnt happen overnight once she came to me and told me she was a match and it was going to happen it was just a shock at first
2835295 its great that people care about someone theyve never ever met ive realized there are people who care
2835296 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
2835297 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
2835298 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
2835299 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
2835300 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
2835301 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
2835302 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
2835303 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
2835304 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
2835305 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy
2835306 volatility remained high in both the us equity and fixed income markets last week
2835307 however a less hawkish statement on policy from the fomc federal open market committee on august 5 combined with sharply declining energy prices provided a powerful lift for dow jones industrials last week despite generally weak economic reports
2835308 barring a physical disruption that may temporarily spike prices we judge that oil prices have peaked for the next few years
2835309 ive heard people say that this summer seems cooler but i crunched the numbers and it really isnt
2835310 we havent been having big heat waves and the monsoon moisture from northern mexico hasnt been that bad but temperatures are a bit higher than normal and we dont see any change coming up right now

2835314 ten years ago a strike would have been inconvenient to the customers but since they had no other place to go verizon would not have lost business
2835315 however today the customer increasingly has choice if they want todays customers can give their business to one of verizons competitors and walk away from verizon altogether
2835316 je kunt als land altijd een extreem talent hebben maar het winnen van goud op de estafette geeft aan dat we een brede top hebben dat lukt niet met geluk er zit beleid achter
2835317 hier heb ik 23 jaar en twee maanden voor gewerkt
2835318 nieuwe inzichten maken dat het oude avi systeem waarmee al sinds 1974 wordt gewerkt aan vervanging toe was
2835319 voor ouders scholen maar ook voor bijvoorbeeld bibliotheken en boekwinkels zal dit een grote omschakeling zijn een soort revolutie een verbetering dat zeker
2835320 in nederland is men vaak te haastig met het invoeren van nieuwe testen daar spelen ook andere elementen een rol bij cito is een commerci le organisatie en heeft baat bij snelle invoer
2835321 als een leerkracht twijfels heeft over hoe het lezen zich ontwikkelt dan kan hij alsnog met nieuwe avi toetskaarten individueel gaan toetsen
2835322 die teksten waren echt verouderd er is bijvoorbeeld een tekst over astronaut wubbo ockels er zijn veel kinderen die niet meer weten wie dat is
2835323 net als de groeicurve op het consultatiebureau maar dan gaat het niet over lengte maar over leesprestatie ouders kunnen dan in een oogopslag zien hoe het gaat met lezen
2835324 scholen die hardop willen blijven lezen met alle leerlingen kunnen dat doen maar wij vinden het niet nodig
2835325 we moeten met china in dialoog blijven over deze gevoelige zaken
2835326 ik heb eens een lange discussie met wen jiabao gehad over de definitie van mensenrechten hij ziet het als sociaal economische rechten ik zeg dat het ook gaat om vrijheid en hoe juridische procedures worden gevoerd we komen er vervolgens niet echt uit maar het is belangrijk om het steeds weer te benoemen
2835327 bij dit soort zaken gaat het puur om de kracht van de herhaling
2835328 ik verwachtte eigenlijk toch wel meer je leert hier vooral tools waarmee je later zelf weer kunt gaan rommelen het belangrijkste hiervan is dat je met collegas van gedachten kunt wisselen
2835329 ik had geen idee wat er allemaal speelt maar ik kwam hier wel een beetje naar toe met het idee dat er allemaal kant en klare programmas waren die we direct kunnen gebruiken dat is dus niet zo
2835330 het afval heeft een hoge restwaarde als je het op een goede manier recyclet
2835331 van een miljoen geshredderde stukjes printplaat zijn er soms maar twintig van goud en soms meer dan honderd
2835332 maar het terugwinnen van waardevolle metalen is een ingewikkeld metaalkundig proces dat kunnen wij niet zelf
2835333 het mooiste zou natuurlijk zijn als wij al het nederlandse ict afval zouden verwerken
2835334 maar je komt er natuurlijk niet achter of iedereen zijn kapotte of tweedehands spullen ook daadwerkelijk naar het milieudepot brengt
2835335 en toch is het nog geen twee procent van de nederlandse bevolking
2835336 tijd voor iets nieuws want elk moment in het nu is straks al verleden tijd dus de geschiedenis is dood leve de geschiedenis
2835337 en dat is heel onnatuurlijk kunstmatig want over het thema dat je als museum gekozen hebt wil je toch vertellen tot op de dag van gisteren
2835338 hoe verder een cultuur van je af staat hoe minder herkenning en beleving je als museum kunt realiseren bovendien is het water van de zuiderzee nog steeds hetzelfde water de mensen de dorpen en de steden en de paar overgebleven vissen zijn nog steeds verbonden met hun verwanten van voor 1932 het trekken van een streep in de tijd doet die tijd niet stilstaan
2835339 we gaan ons niet alleen meer bezighouden met het verleden van de zuiderzee maar ook met de toekomst van de polders met de ruimtelijke ordening van laag nederland met het beheer van het ijsselmeer en de waddenzee en met de recreatie we willen natuurlijk het verhaal van holland van land en water vertellen maar ook de hollandse cultuur van de strijd tegen het water laten zien alleen met zoveel mogelijk afwisseling steeds weer iets nieuws het waren altijd prachtig plaatjes en die moeten we blijven vasthouden maar niet als een platte ansichtkaart wat een museum op het eerste gezicht is maar meer als een adventskalender waarin je steeds weer een ander plaatje of deurtje kunt openmaken het moet je verrassen
2835340 via gerenommeerde kunsttijdschriften moeten we buitenlanders ervan zien te overtuigen dat ze dit museum gezien moeten hebben
2835341 er zijn nieuwe concepten nodig er moet een verbinding gelegd worden tussen de oude werkelijkheid van het traditionele museum en een nieuwe werkelijkheid van museale beleving
2835342 elke twee jaar moet er een nieuw paviljoen komen om ook een heel andere doelgroep te bereiken als directeur van een museum opereer je altijd op een snijvlak hoe behoud ik mn vaste klanten en hoe krijg ik er nieuwe bij die laatste vraag weegt nu zwaarder dan vroeger je moet vooruitzien kijk iemand van zeventig zal denken die aandacht voor de periode van 1880 tot 1930 daar is niks mis mee maar iemand van vijftien zal die geschiedenis weinig zeggen jonge mensen weten toch niet meer wat de zuiderzee voor ons land betekende zij snappen niet hoe belangrijk de aanleg van de afsluitdijk was voor de mensen de industrie en het landschap langs de zuiderzee
2835343 ik bedoel daarmee dat je de producten van toen bijvoorbeeld de bloempiramides van delfts blauw uit de 18de eeuwse ateliers van koninklijke tichelaar uit makkum verbindt met wat hedendaagse ontwerpers als antwoord daarop geven
2835344 de vaste expositie stond er soms al twintig jaar negentig procent van onze objecten ligt in depot dat is toch zonde die worden alleen mooier als je met hedendaagse voorwerpen vergelijkt zoals keramiek juwelen scheepsmodellen of kleding je wilt toch zoveel mogelijk van je collectie laten zien daarom hebben wij mode van victor en rolf aangekocht om die te kunnen vergelijken met de klederdracht van de zuiderzee als je die link tussen heden en verleden niet maakt maar je alleen focust op het verleden dan zul je de zaak op termijn moeten sluiten
2835345 zeker in het museum zelf ziet men het wel zitten onze medewerkers worden steeds jonger minister plasterk van cultuur heeft de plannen ook goedgekeurd de relatie met de stad enkhuizen wordt steeds beter voor het eerst in de geschiedenis hebben we geld van de gemeente gekregen
2835346 je hebt ons teleurgesteld je bent niet diep gegaan als jij niet kunt leiden moeten wij afzien
2835347 dit heeft niks met schaamte te maken dit is gewoon voor mijn kinderen zij heeft gewoon gezegd van joh als jij daar in je blote kont gaat lopen dan ga ik mijn naam veranderen
2835348 goed nou ga eerst even gewoon lekker zitten op je stoel
2835349 ja pesies misschien moeten jullie je even uitrekken zonder je buurman te slaan kan je even je armen omhoog doen kan jij ook h johan eventjes handjes in de lucht oe misschien hoor je wat gekraak jullie zijn natuurlijk helemaal soepel nu na al dat dansen goed dan wil ik graag dat jullie je ogen sluiten zonder in slaap te vallen en zonder te snurken gewoon even lekker zitten haha je ogen dicht doen wat zal je doen als je zes miljoen gewonnen had en als je wilt mag je nu je ogen open doen en aantekeningen maken van wat je hebt gezien
2835350 you cant be a byrd gene if you cant fly
2835351 so you want to be a rock n roll star
2835352 ah but i was so much older then im younger than that now
2835353 no song on another side distressed dylans friends in the movement more than my back pages in which he transmutes the rude incoherence of his eclc rant into the organized density of art the lilting refrain must be one of the most lyrical expressions of political apostasy ever penned it is a recantation in every sense of the word

2835358 considering the number of revisionist histories which have been published in these past few decades attempting to depict the second world war as merely a morally neutral conflict between nation states over competing self interests do you still believe that that war was indeed a battle between good and evil

2835361 meth is the scariest drug i know but information has been provided to the community that is accurate and real stating people die lose their futures and dont make good decisions
2835362 but if people want to drink and do drugs at parties to socialize and want to look good meth is not the drug theyre going to take
2835363 but addicts find an alternative which for them is cocaine and heroin
2835364 were not out of the woods yet its gotten more expensive and weve seen fewer arrests theres just less product here
2835365 meth is not seen as attractive and has horrible side effects
2835366 kids arent attracted to meth anymore because its dirty and there is a stigma about being a tweaker heroin is seen as classy and something celebrities do
2835367 when they run out of their prescriptions and cant get anymore they turn to heroin because its cheaper
2835368 were going to see a generation of heroin addicts born from pain medication addicts
2835369 the idea of quitting is terrifying for them because of the pain
2835370 and if you have a legitimate pain and need medications its simply terrifying
2835371 i was slamming injecting it so often that the veins disappeared in my arms i didnt like it but i couldnt quit it made me crazy
2835372 i had to have it in my system its got to be there or you go crazy and sick
2835373 i think it would help him connect on so many levels
2835374 plus we plan to do something fun when he does finally get married nobody goes away unhappy with the way theyve been portrayed on our show
2835375 william is a huge fan of the show if it was just up to him hed jump at the chance but the rest of the family might take some convincing
2835376 william did quite a bit of acting at school and is used to speaking in public hed be a natural
2835377 by the way were cursed so every now and then a girl cousin of yours will get married off and never be heard of again
2835378 adios mi amigo lleve su asno y no se vuelva
2835379 it saves the taxpayers money and addresses a very critical life safety issue for individuals who are out in the desert in these very dangerous months
2835380 on the next food network star adam exhibited a unique combination of quick wit passion for food and an engaging personality
2835381 he earned millions of fans across the country who have let us know that we have a second star in our midst we feel this series is a perfect fit for his talents letting him showcase his brand of humor while he works for food
2835382 in this engagement my command lost in killed wounded and missing a total of five hundred and forty two

2835389 why do some apparently strong christians fall away from the faith in college
2835390 why do some of even the strongest christians start to seem more worldly in college
2835391 why do i feel comfortable acting a certain way around college friends yet feel uncomfortable acting that way around friends from church or my family
2835392 why does that friend who never wouldve thought that way before college think that way now
2835393 therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall
2835394 this is my comfort in my affliction that your promise gives me life the insolent utterly deride me but i do not turn away from your law when i think of your rules from of old i take comfort o lord
2835395 but god being rich in mercy because of the great love with which he loved us even when we were dead in our trespasses made us alive together with christ
2835396 ok i have fought valiantly for thirty years and i want to coast and stay at that level
2835397 do not be deceived god is not mocked for whatever one sows that will he also reap for the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption but the one who sows to the spirit will from the spirit reap eternal life and let us not grow weary of doing good for in due season we will reap if we do not give up so then as we have opportunity let us do good to everyone and especially to those who are of the household of faith
2835398 blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked nor stands in the way of sinners nor sits in the seat of scoffers but his delight is in the law of the lord and on his law he meditates day and night he is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season and its leaf does not wither in all that he does he prospers the wicked are not so but are like chaff that the wind drives away therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the lord knows the way of the righteous but the way of the wicked will perish
2835399 look carefully then how you walk not as unwise but as wise making the best use of the time because the days are evil
2835400 for those of us who write about business every once in a while a book or an article comes along that seems so simple on some levels and yet communicates great wisdom
2835401 we are scared of the water especially when we dont know how to swim when somebody is out to help or rescue us trust and listen
2835402 i had used products before during pregnancy that were supposed to diminish my stretch marks and they didnt work so i put clay essentials on my thighs and upper leg area where i had stretch marks from having my last baby even with just three or four applications i noticed those lines looked like they were starting to disappear it also made my skin so much smoother i highly recommend clay essentials to all of those women out there looking for a product that really does improve the look of stretch marks
2835403 ive been in the cosmetic industry for years and im always looking for natural products i was introduced to clay essentials by my son who came over and urged me to try it i decided to give it a shot and to my amazement my skin felt so tight smooth and soft afterwards i was ready to go out on the town i was very impressed i prefer clay essentials to the product i had been using and would recommend it to anybody
2835404 after 10 years in the landscape business you get a lot of sun damage my skin felt like leather i had always thought clay masques were just for women but after trying clay essentials once wow what a difference i really love that my skin feels so soft smooth and fresh the best it has felt in a decade people are already telling me i look five years younger what more could i ask for
2835405 im 55 years old and have had problems with age spots after using clay essentials for a couple of weeks im really starting to see them fade ive used the eye amp lip masque as well and ive noticed that the wrinkles on my upper lip are softening and look like theyre disappearing over the years ive spent an awful lot of money on high priced cosmetics especially skin care products but ive found that with clay essentials it doesnt cost as much and im getting better results
2835406 im an aesthetician and i work with plastic surgeons i want to see results and thats what youll get with clay essentials its impressive to have a product where you actually see skin improvements after one application i would definitely call clay essentials a miracle clay great price great results

2835414 we basically have to our needs are not going to go away and the only solution is to add more space
2835415 were obviously disappointed but it is understandable given the current economic conditions what we are going to do is basically regroup listen to what the citizens have to say and then well come back
2835416 i really wouldnt want to speculate on that its something the board will have to talk about but i dont think that if there would be a change it would not be much at all because weve already bought it down to the minimum size to last 20 years
2835417 if we do any more cutting it wouldnt save very much money and it would end up costing more in the long run

2835451 all i saw was this car i had seen all the flashing lights but i didnt realize it was all right there
2835452 i hate to think what would have happened if that car had rolled across four lanes
2835453 the tough economic environment including high fuel prices has hit the retail sector harder since consumers have pared traveling and pared their discretionary spending
2835454 that was one big store that closed and we redeveloped that space in a more appealing manner with 15 to 20 new stores
2835455 many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name
2835456 it shall be in that day says the lord of hosts that i will cut off the names of the idols from the land and they shall no longer be remembered
2835457 this is an opportunity for everybody who wants to put two cents worth in to let the legislators know that it is time for there to be legislation in the state

2835465 n s temos que continuar buscando as nossas metas continuar buscando o gr mio acho que estamos no caminho certo temos que trabalhar mais agora teremos muitos confrontos diretos na competi o a disputa vai ser grande temos que estar preparados
2835466 complicado voc v a equipe jogando dentro de casa e marcando atr s do meio de campo tivemos algumas dificuldades para tocar a bola e a tivemos que abrir pelas laterais mas assim quando a gente joga contra equipe pequena eles querem sempre ganhar sempre crescem
2835467 i dont care about the house but i got all my babies out
2835468 it was so scary you just dont know how scary it was to not know whether or not i had my kids
2835469 human consciousness is a function of the ebb and flow of neural impulses in various regions of the brain the very substrate that drugs such as psilocybin act upon
2835470 understanding what mediates these effects is clearly within the realm of neuroscience and deserves investigation
2835471 neste momento eu n o estou perto de concluir nenhuma transfer ncia porque estou muito ocupado talvez na pr xima semana pode acontecer mas agora temos nosso foco na copa dos campe es que uma grande meta para n s
2835472 isto mostra que o basquete est crescendo em todo o mundo
2835473 o basquete era visto como um esporte menor por m todos o praticam agora a nba tem f s em volta de todo o mundo e est se tornando um jogo global
2835474 a gente n o fez um trabalho no primeiro tempo a equipe tava meio ap tica no come o a gente tem que buscar nossas metas e nossos objetivos que buscar o gr mio temos que trabalhar s rio como a gente estava trabalhando

2835476 o cruzeiro melhorou criou algumas situa es para tentar empatar mas pelo primeiro tempo n s n o mereciamos um resultado melhor
2835477 at this time were focusing on the health and welfare of the guests involved in this tragic accident
2835478 o gramado est horrivel n o parece nem campo profissional
2835479 fawn over mccain and obama but their coverage also is less cynical than their national counterparts and focuses on issues closer to home
2835480 an uncritical account of mccains appearance at the sturgis motorcycle rally
2835481 mccain joked that he noticed there was a beauty contest at the campground and he asked his wife if she would enter
2835482 were agape as they snapped photos of girls dancing on stripper poles muscular bikers strolling around and the general air of freewheeling frivolity at the campground
2835483 on stage sen john mccain pitched a summer long suspension of the 18 5 cent federal gas tax as a way to give missourians immediate cost relief at the gas pump but behind closed doors the republican presidential nominee acknowledged its very doubtful his campaign promise will ever be fulfilled much less debated in congress it would be hard to do obviously mccain told the news leader in a one on one interview
2835484 and his story described how some economists doubted the tax cut would make a significant difference
2835485 sometimes campaigns dial for dummies and end up reaching sharpies
2835486 when we talked to consumers about coke we realized they didnt know that it has no added preservatives or artificial flavors
2835487 we felt it was important to reassure coke drinkers of this fact
2835488 youll find all the ingredients in coke and all the other drinks we sell on their can or bottle
2835489 pemberton is more fact based affirming for consumers that coca cola never has had and never will have added preservatives or artificial flavors
2835490 im very skeptical about whether a campaign about no additives or preservatives is the way to go
2835491 cokes big strength has always been the lifestyle and the attitude of the brand not its health credentials
2835492 obesity and health issues in general are hot topics at the moment and they are not going to go away
2835493 are having to work out what their future looks like in this very health and diet obsessed world and it is a source of considerable anxiety
2835494 the aim of the blipverts is not to try to tell a big story
2835495 this very substantial investment reflects the governments commitment to rural and regional health services across tasmania
2835496 the rba has been disturbed by the rapidity of the economic slowdown which has been complicated by the credit crisis
2835497 we estimate that domestic demand slowed to an annualised pace of 1 6 in the june quarter down from almost 6 in december
2835498 we now expect that the bank will cut rates by 0 5 following its september 2 board meeting
2835499 a year ago less than 50 of home loans went to the big banks
2835500 now its over 70 and theres virtually only four lenders out there if theres a rate cut they are more than likely to keep half of it

2835511 one of the most important lessons of the wars in iraq and afghanistan is that military success is not sufficient to win
2835512 for the people that showed up they certainly saw not only one of the great champions of our football club but of the game of afl so it was a pretty good day for everyone
2835513 we had seven scoring shots to five in the last quarter but we just could not convert
2835514 i couldnt ask too much from our playing group i could not ask for any more than what they put on display
2835515 to come over and not play our game style we wanted to play was disappointing

2835529 quando succedono queste cose sempre dura per latleta che aspetta spiega maurizio allievi ma se poi va sempre cos la giuria pu metterci anche di pi
2835530 abbiamo deciso di togliere lendo con un giro prima delluscita continua lallenatore azzurro perch i giudici non erano univoci sullinterpretazione del movimento vista la difficolt dellattrezzo certe volte saggio eliminare qualche rischio inutile
2835531 sono contento di aver fatto il mio esercizio rispetto ad atene dove inseguivo il sogno della vita qui avevo voglia di riscattare un lungo periodo di appannamento le sensazioni dei giorni passati erano buone avevo sempre eseguito salti molto ampi ma la sbarra del campo gara leggermente diversa da quelle di allenamento e cos ho preferito tenere un po pi corte le braccia per non rischiare di perdere la presa in altri termini ho pensato pi a prenderla che alla compostezza del corpo
2835532 igor in finale pu arrivare tranquillamente a 16 2 continua allievi prima che salisse ho teso leggermente i tiranti dellattrezzo e gli ho detto di essere pi corto visto lerrore in prova ci tengo comunque ad elogiare tutta la squadra e mi dispiace tanto per angioletti che ha fatto bene il salto pi difficile ed ha sbagliato quello pi facile che poteva regalargli una finale meritata al volteggio alberto ha tirato il suo programma al cavallo ma ha perso un decimo in uscita e a questi livelli non puoi permetterti la minima sbavatura secondo me coppolino agli anelli poteva tranquillamente stare sopra al 16 00 infine pozzo ha perso di un soffio due grandi occasioni al corpo libero arrivato abbondante nellultima diagonale e alla sbarra ha sbagliato il movimento prima del salto pi difficile
2835533 ci pu stare conferma laviere di biella non ho sbagliato per paura o per stanchezza ma perch ho cercato il colpo grosso non ho rimpianti cho provato sono allolimpiade ed un dovere dare il massimo al corpo libero la storia diversa l s che ho sentito la pressione eravamo al primo attrezzo e alla fine ero affaticato pi di braccia che di gambe purtroppo i tre passetti in chiusura hanno pregiudicato una prova nel complesso buona ora spero di entrare nella finale a 24 poi sar una battaglia ad ogni modo ragazzi che colpo docchio quando siamo entrati nonostante fossero le qualificazioni il palazzetto era quasi pieno il risultato di squadra non era importante eppure ognuno di noi ha sentito il dovere di tirare fuori tutto anche negli attrezzi che non erano i nostri

2835540 that a democratically elected president of georgia and i quote must go
2835541 is your governments objective regime change in georgia the overthrow of the democratically elected government of georgia
2835542 id like to say straightaway that regime change is an american expression

2835550 i can just not imagine a better diplomatic wingman than ambassador ryan crocker we were determined to achieve unity of effort
2835551 we were determined to work together to get it done
2835552 movie programmer kirby sweetman goes on a search for the holy grail of horror cinema
2835553 i dont drink which has been a big question mark for people its like you did a movie about wine and you dont drink at all
2835554 i play a bartender in the film and the bartender is not supposed to be imbibing while on duty so i keep it under control
2835555 i did drink wine at one time but as i started to get a little older at about 19 getting that headache in the morning or that puffiness is just not very user friendly for my job
2835556 everything became a little clearer sharper and better for me when
2835557 but getting up early in the morning with a fresh face is better
2835558 the honour is double or 10 times more when you hear the names of those who have gone before you and the things they have achieved
2835559 i went to the audition pathetically in a very low cut blouse with a push up bra

2835614 my husband only ever admitted having one drink the trust was non existent
2835615 people think they are protecting the children from the drinking
2835616 my mother was heartbroken and baffled by my drinking she aged 10 years i felt guilt shame and self hatred but it only made me drink more

2835634 the past two summers have been tough for diy retailers during this highly weather sensitive time of the year
2835635 this year we all hoped for a strong summer with warm weather but no hosepipe ban to get consumers back into the garden spending money on leisure products like furniture and paddling pools
2835636 unfortunately the summer sun has been less than consistent which combined with the credit crisis means retailers are banking on the perfect august

2835638 damage to houses from the explosion across the street and we checked out those houses to make sure that there was no one in the houses injured so far we have not found anyone injured seriously injured in those houses
2835639 we have been dealing with propane tankers rail tankers and we have flames impinging on them and thats why we are having a dangerous situation
2835640 the problem with propane in large amounts is that youre actually storing huge quantities of energy
2835641 the problem is is that if a fire is underneath a vessel containing a large amount of propane the walls of the vessel can weaken and we have a phenomenon known as a bleve which stands for boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion its extremely dangerous
2835642 one of the worst occurred in feyzin france a number of years ago and the vessel exploded and it killed all the firefighters the most dangerous thing at the moment is for those firefighters really
2835643 i think people are going to be very nervous from this point onward

2835648 the fall in wealth will mean that uk household spending growth is likely to slow to just 0 5pc in 2009
2835649 however that will not be enough in itself to push the uk into recession we are sailing pretty close to recession but it will take something else to push us over the edge
2835650 there is no doubt that the mood has darkened in the past two or three months

2835666 banks freely admit that they are chasing margin rather than market share since the credit crunch hit which is making mainstream mortgages profitable again
2835667 before the onset of the credit crunch lenders complained that it was increasingly difficult to make a profit on mortgages because of the cut throat competition which meant they had to slash rates to attract business
2835668 now lenders are in the driving seat and able to improve margins and profits while borrowers struggle to adjust to higher rates
2835669 volume was king because lenders were chasing market share but that is no longer the name of the game as mortgages are no longer so freely available
2835670 as a natural consequence of that lenders have put up their rates initially to manage the amount of lending they were doing but that has resulted in business now being done at a higher margin than in the last few years
2835671 we saw the opportunity of the first half of this year to write good quality mortgages and improve market share at attractive margins
2835672 rates have changed in response to movements in the base rate our charges and rates remain among the most competitive in the market
2835673 a lot of people do not think about shorting aim stocks as there are fewer shares available to short
2835674 it may be slightly harder to follow shares on aim but people have started to look more closely at these companies
2835675 while they may find it harder to do that on aim people will try to short them
2835676 aim is not a traditional ground for shorting as it is esoteric
2835677 but as shorts get more crowded in the main market some people will look at aim people will look for ideas as will hedge funds trying to make returns

2835693 i just want to know if your athletes would listen to the uss anthem or that of the virgin islands

2835695 the uks was the first real national anthem in 1745 and it was adopted by dozens of other countries sweden germany even russia at one point the idea developed that it was only the words that were important in expressing national character the tune to god save the queen was seen as meaning national anthem and the words were what made it appropriate to each country

2835698 the conflict has caused civilian casualties and more are at risk it is essential that humanitarian agencies be able to reach the affected and the displaced
2835699 i think a certain amount of tension is very healthy and a certain amount of different views because of the bubble that a president is in and the bubble that a candidate is in sometimes you find out afterward something that oh boy i wish i had heard thus and such and so and so so i appreciate and want some of the tension i dont want too much of it obviously because we have to have certain efficiencies but i think there is a balance there

2835731 we came up with the idea of caging the live animal and creating a back story about how this was the only real live one in captivity this would then give us the opportunity to showcase our animation and film making skills and create a really big noise about it generate a real buzz

2835735 we hired in an hd camera for the day from fact and a granada cameraman pete rowland shot the lot interviews pieces to camera and voxes
2835736 the whole lot had to be filmed with nothing there but pretending it was and then the animation was masked in later the voxes were done by taking the media that was already on the web out on an iphone
2835737 finally i was given the almost finished piece which i took back to granada and worked with editor mark hoxley to put the finishing touches to it

2835769 georges st pierre obviously is impressive but i think anderson silva is the best
2835770 hes the whole package he hasnt really been challenged hes fought top notch competition and hes taken them out every one of them the guys phenomenal hes the most impressive fighter right now georges is up there no doubt
2835771 its one of those fights where you start looking at it and youre going is he too tough for his own good

2835773 me i dont fight for the fame the belt me i dont care im not the kind of fighter who fights because they have no choice if i want tomorrow i have education i can do something else i like my lifestyle and i fight for myself
2835774 that we were able to dominate so strongly just speaks to georges st pierres strength not to jon fitchs weakness

2835786 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2835787 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2835788 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2835789 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2835810 its very similar to republican presidential candidate john mccains situation where hes got to come in as an independent as a straight shooter
2835811 you could apply the same kind of thing to hulshof

2835816 but it will be easy for him to say ive been working in the field off to the side trying to do things for you like the no call list for telemarketers and i havent really been involved in the unpopular decisions that the incumbent party has made
2835817 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2835818 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2835819 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking at in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2835820 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2835821 you told me more about the process than i know
2835822 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
2835823 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
2835824 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
2835825 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
2835826 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
2835827 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands
2835828 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores

2835853 i am certainly shocked and disturbed by the revelation that the firm was retained by both the developer and the city council what happens is that when you have a lobbyist try to negotiate that bill you wonder whether theyre lobbying in the best interests of the city or in the best interests of the developer
2835854 mr keenan is certainly a stakeholder in what happens with ab1991 but hes not a partner if chop is paying half our bill he should write a check to the city and the city should write a check to california strategies
2835855 i think its pretty clear that ab1991 is in both of our interests so i dont know where the conflict is its not like the city or i am telling them how to do their job every couple weeks somebody calls from the firm and tells me whats going on
2835856 it was very informal and i decided it was in my self interest to put some horsepower behind california strategies efforts
2835857 if the assertion is that the payments arent to influence legislation or administrative action then theres no disclosure requirement
2835858 it wasnt like he was opposing us in the settlement agreement we

2835883 olympics is the ultimate dream of every sportsperson monika has been unjustly prevented from realising her dream where shall she demonstrate her talent now her career is as good as dead and so is indian sport
2835884 what is the point of writing about her we dont want anything now
2835885 ngouba a male name accorded to her for her manliness is loved by the entire village she is strong willed she had the confidence that she would bring us a medal why are they the sai officials so wicked
2835886 she had a good physique since childhood and sai chose her for weightlifting
2835887 she was forced to join the crpf as a havildar after our own state denied her a job she would still love to come back and represent manipur
2835888 after she won the 2006 commonwealth silver the crpf promised her the post of sub inspector which never happened
2835889 had the ibobi singh government acted swiftly monika would be competing in beijing
2835890 we have lost count of number of players we have produced monikas episode however has discouraged parents
2835891 we now want the centre to give a medal to monika if they had sent her she would have brought back a medal
2835892 the course of action will be decided by the people of manipur though monika is our child she now belongs to manipur
2835893 i didnt have to do anything here its been a relaxing trip

2835896 we are hopeful that the nsg will not be unreasonable in giving a clean and unconditional waiver to india in the coming weeks negotiations
2835897 either the current package of the deal or no further giving in
2835898 we dont think the nsg will be in the end unreasonable to let india move ahead
2835899 of course were looking to wrap it up wrap it up in the best manner
2835900 the left ankle pain is quite a bit im on pain killers im doing the best i can
2835901 its not a worry were back to test cricket the way it was a month ago
2835902 that means the land will continue to be available for the pilgrimage temporarily as it was used before the cabinet order of may 20 2008 there is no need to transfer the land to the board
2835903 because of its novelty this proposal attracted attention of everybody more so it was raised by an important central leader
2835904 the act gives responsibility of the pilgrimage to the shrine board and the government is kept out the high court order had given the user agency the shrine board permission to temporarily erect facilities for pilgrims during the duration of the yatra
2835905 it has to be discussed with all the parties involved
2835906 if there is such a proposal on a par with our demands we will agree when it comes to us in writing

2835913 there are aspects there where we think during our legal review it would go beyond the constitutional provisions but in the end we never looked at an agenda of term extension that is not the ultimate objective
2835914 the ultimate objective is having peace in mindanao it just so happens that during these negotiations there might be a need for us to amend the constitution toward a federal system of government
2835915 senator pimentel himself told me that he will not allow his bill to have other riders or other aspects so he will just limit it to just a federal system we are not talking of parliamentary
2835916 so why sign the ancestral domain accord if you cannot deliver there may be another motive and that motive could be charter change
2835917 i dont think we are negotiating in bad faith we know we can be able to go from the moa to congress to enable it i think congress would hear us out if there is need for enactment of laws
2835918 i would like to believe that the president has the authority she has the ability to be able to push this through there is certainly an abundant political will that would drive her to ensure that whatever is agreed upon with the milf could be enabled and implemented
2835919 its not only for mindanao itself the expanded armm or the bangsamoro juridical entity but this is something that would help solve a lingering problem that we have of disorder in mindanao the continuing armed conflict that is affecting the whole republic in terms of the economy perceptions of investors if we can have peace in mindanao everyone knows especially our legislators that we can uplift the condition not only of mindanao but of the whole country
2835920 why dont we give them more economic powers a little bit of more political authority what is wrong with that this is still within the republic of the philippines
2835921 its the people who should tell us what they want if they dont then no
2835922 when you open charter change can you say its only up to this point
2835923 you can try a law establishing greater powers in the bje after all the concept of an autonomous government is in the constitution in fact the complaint is that the law that was passed is not real autonomy
2835924 thats why im saying when people should be happy with this breakthrough it becomes so suspect because the actions of the leadership raise so many questions on her real agenda
2835925 is this peace making by improvisation or is it cha cha not for peace but for political survival
2835926 thats why people are so afraid now that the position taken by the sc before that both houses should vote separately will no longer be the decision because majority of justices are already her appointees
2835927 a lot of people are pretty angry that the propane company was actually brought into the neighbourhood
2835928 from a performance point of view rain is always helpful
2835929 but in terms of understanding the car which is really what we need to do for next year hungary was really quite useful
2835930 we were quite encouraged by the rear suspension system which is by no means properly executed for next year but it includes some of the ideas that we will use for next year and it has significantly improved the overall balance and predictability of the car so we came away not with the best results but encouraged by what weve got
2835931 it was slightly difficult because they both and jenson especially got hemmed in behind heidfeld and for the first third of the race he was stuck behind nick but couldnt go through the last two corners fast enough to get a run on nick down the straight
2835932 then what we tried to do was have a shorter middle sector but we failed to come out in front of heidfeld by one second so again he then got involved in blue flag situations so you start losing more time
2835933 with rubens he got a very good start but at the pit stop we had a problem with the fuel rig and it was as simple as not going on cleanly we spilled about half a litre of fuel which gave us a quick flash fire but the guys reacted very well and we lost time but no more than that
2835934 if you or your family have no urgent need to remain in georgia you should leave as soon as possible
2835935 it is wise to do so while some air services are still available and the border remains open

2835940 they poked us and stabbed us with the machetes and they were asking for money specifically dollars
2835941 we had a few quetzales guatemalas currency but we had no dollars with us on the boat
2835942 i said we need help i said my husband was not moving
2835943 our stance would not change with sanctions or the threat of sanctions
2835944 it is important that our country is ready to insist on its rights under any conditions

2835947 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2835948 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2835949 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2835950 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2835951 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2835952 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c
2835953 we havent fully recovered from a natural disaster and now were again being battered by a man made calamity
2835954 all peaceful avenues have been exhausted to resolve the conflict
2835955 we are now compelled to resort to the application of proportionate and justifiable force so that peace and order may be restored in north cotabato
2835956 our goal is to have vacation rental properties located along the entire coastline of oregon since the founding of oregon beach vacations in 2004 we have been approached by many homeowners along the southern oregon coast to manage their properties with the opening of our new florence office this august we will be able to give property owners and those interested in vacationing from florence to bandon and all areas in between the service they deserve and expect from our organization
2835957 we have kept a list of homeowners that have expressed interest in joining our rental program and we are just getting to the point where we can reconnect with these homeowners and offer our services to them within twelve months we are looking to have upwards of 40 properties on the south oregon coast from organic growth and we will be looking into acquisitions in this area
2835958 organising something on the scale of the lambeth conference will inevitably result in a small deficit sometimes
2835959 the archbishops council met last week to propose a solution
2835960 there is a weapons shortage and a shortage of volunteers
2835961 if they continue killing people they wont win any seats in the next election
2835962 weve been seeing a change in the position of politicians
2835963 we want to change the views of ordinary people who are against the sadr movement
2835964 i expect it will be a successful political shift for the sadr movement and a change from guns to culture
2835965 the problem is that these terrorist groups are not motivated by only one or two reasons
2835966 there are groups that say they are from the mahdi army but they are not and theyve destroyed what mahdi army has built
2835967 if sadr cant control the special groups how can he expect to disarm them his call to disarm them will disappear with the wind
2835968 the military institution says it is ok to kill and use the most horrible weapons and that killing the enemy is heroic
2835969 i respect dick for having humanity over his military obligations
2835970 the regular people and the government wanted to surrender but the military people didnt want to surrender
2835971 i believe it is the stubbornness of the military people that caused the bombing of japan
2835972 a large trend is being crystallized among the palestinian national authority pna in ramallah to call for settling the situation with the gaza strip by force
2835973 to give the last chance for the egyptian government and the arab league to convince hamas to immediately end its coup and engage in the dialogue
2835974 but the door for dialogue will not be open forever and the leadership only gave one month time for the efforts
2835975 will be a dangerous thing if it was officially made
2835976 it will boost the internal split and separate gaza from the west bank
2835977 fatah elements who dominate the plos executive committee have a plan to prevent any attempt of approach between hamas and fatah
2835978 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2835979 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2835980 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2835981 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2835982 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2835983 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country
2835984 after that the sex was more sadistic than loving it seemed to molly like ronald enjoyed when she came home with other mens semen still inside her at night while she slept he would sometimes ejaculate on her face she got pregnant again in 1987 hoping the second kid would solve the problems of the first but by then all they really felt for each other was hostility

2836002 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2836003 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations

2836005 not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armor and increased attacks on tskhinvali

2836079 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
2836080 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past

2836082 i think thats part of our civic psychology its deep in our civic dna
2836083 were trying to show off the kind of flavor of what the west has to offer
2836084 the fact is our economy now is extremely diversified resilient and contemporary

2836201 the poet inspired by music attempts to express in words the impressions evoked by the music in these words music appears as will that is the poet linguistically represents the agitations of passion creating a verbal equivalent inadequate as it necessarily is of the appearance of music once again it is a question of the example or similitude that symbolizes a universality

2836210 hay divergencia en la tradici n jud a en cuanto a permitir el aborto en caso de malformaciones fetales en estos casos el aborto no se justifica por las dificultades que deber enfrentar la criatura sino por el sufrimiento mental o emocional para la madre que resulta de continuar el embarazo el factor determinante es pues la mujer y no la condici n o futuro del feto
2836211 antes de 1869 la mayor a de los te logos ense aban que el feto se convert a en un ser humano con alma a partir de los 40 d as a veces m s tarde despu s de la concepci n
2836212 es necesario ayudar a tomar conciencia del mal intr nseco del crimen del aborto que al atentar contra la vida humana en su inicio es tambi n una agresi n contra la sociedad misma los pol ticos y legisladores como servidores del bien social tienen el deber de defender el derecho fundamental a la vida fruto del amor de dios
2836213 los problemas colectivos que tocan la conciencia de cada individuo se vuelven sumamente dif ciles de solucionar especialmente cuando existen distintas posturas al respecto y se busca establecer un margo legislativo que satisfaga a la mayor a de los ciudadanos no es f cil solucionar conflictos ticos es establecer prioridades entre ellos pero s existe un consenso con respecto a la necesidad de aceptar excepciones bien justificadas a la hora de aplicar estos principios
2836214 es por ello que para analizar ticamente el problema del aborto inducido adem s de los principios morales aplicados al campo de la salud el legislador tambi n debe tomar en cuenta los preceptos que orientan la formaci n del derecho positivo y que forman parte de la filosof a del derecho mediante un an lisis objetivo y estimando las consecuencias pr cticas de las alternativas legales que se presentan se puede llegar a conclusiones ticamente validas
2836215 sin pormenorizar las diversas teor as pol ticas al respecto la idea de democracia se apoya en que el poder pol tico debe residir en la comunidad puesto que nadie posee por derecho propio la facultad de regir sobre sus semejantes
2836216 por otra parte la idea de justicia se centra en la distribuci n equitativa de cargas y beneficios sin distinci n de g nero raza edad o nivel socioecon mico es decir todas las personas dentro de una sociedad determinada merecen igual acceso a bienes y servicios que cubran sus necesidades humanas b sicas del mismo modo el concepto de equidad jur dica implica no s lo la igualdad en los derechos fundamentales sino tambi n la ecuanimidad ante la ley
2836217 nuevamente nos vemos ante un hecho que despierta ardientes pol micas posiciones encontradas y perjuicios arraigados como es el tema del aborto curiosamente la legislaci n m s primitiva no lo consideraba como situaci n para ser sancionada aunque siempre hab a puntos de vista respetables que sosten an criterios adversos
2836218 en el derecho romano durante la poca cl sica se mantuvo la licitud del aborto
2836219 con el cristianismo aparece una nueva concepci n de la vida y es cuando el estado interviene para repudiar y sancionar tal pr ctica el derecho can nico basado en la autoridad de los santos padres y especialmente san agust n consideraba el aborto procurado como homicidio y aceptaba la distinci n aristot lica del plazo en la animaci n del feto el cual ten a lugar 40 d as despu s de la concepci n para los varones y 80 para las hembras si se efectuaba la muerte del feto con alma animado en tal caso deb a imponerse al autor la pena capital y si se efectuaba la muerte del feto no animado recib a una pena mucho menor se le castigaba en este caso con el confinamiento tal distinci n pas a las legislaciones
2836220 en general prosigue diciendo la jurista el aborto fue siempre un tema de discusi n en los diferentes pa ses por sus implicaciones morales y de salud de la madre expuesta a tal interrupci n preocreativa oscilaba entre posiciones un poco mas liberales como es el caso del c digo de carlos v que reduce el castigo al imponer la obligaci n que deb an tener los juecesde reconsultar con los peritos humanizando de alguna forma la sanci n penal
2836221 es a partir de los siglos xviii y xix cuando el hombre inicia un cambio de actitud frente a los conceptos filos ficos morales y sociales cuando surgen los argumentos abolicionistas especialmente en francia y alemania donde se propugnaba la exclusi n del aborto del catalogo de los delitos a partir de esa poca resucitaron los argumentos de que la mujer pod a disponer de si misma negando autonom a al feto
2836222 en el derecho venezolano como en casi todos los pa ses iberoamericanos el aborto esta concebido como de orden individual antes que de comunidad as vemos que este delito esta previsto dentro del c digo penal en el t tulo de los delitos contra las personas el aborto esta catalogado como una trasgresi n que lesiona intereses individuales
2836223 en los ltimos tiempos el aborto se halla ntimamente ligado a situaciones novedosas a condiciones sociales cambiantes a un reajuste de circunstancias que implican lo moral lo pol tico y lo social ante tal situaci n se impone una actitud m s ajustada a la problem tica actual que redefina la punibilidad del aborto
2836224 yo soy cat lico le dije a juan pablo ii pero tambi n soy presidente de una rep blica cuyo estado es laico
2836225 comprendo perfectamente el punto de vista de la iglesia cat lica y como cristiano lo comparto juzgo legitimo que la iglesia pida a los que practican su fe que respeten ciertas prohibiciones pero no corresponde a la ley civil imponerlas con sanciones penales al conjunto del cuerpo social
2836226 mi vida no vale menos que la de ustedes debido a la forma en la que fui concebida
2836227 baseline dopamine levels were 50 percent lower and stimulated dopamine release was significantly attenuated in the brain reward systems of obesity prone rats compared with obesity resistant rats defects in brain dopamine synthesis and release were evident in rats immediately after birth
2836228 previous research has demonstrated that food intake leads to an increase in the release of dopamine in the circuits that mediate the pleasurable aspects of eating
2836229 also chronic food deprivation resulting in decreased body weight leads to decreased dopamine levels therefore increased food intake may represent a compensatory attempt to restore baseline dopamine levels
2836230 these findings have important implications in our understanding of the obesity epidemic the notion that decreased dopamine signaling leads to increased feeding is compatible with the finding from human studies that obese individuals have reduced central dopamine receptors
2836231 we also measured regulators of dopamine synthesis and release in midbrain dopamine pathways
2836232 our molecular analysis suggests that the central dopamine deficits are most likely caused by reduced expression of the genes encoding two proteins one that is involved in dopamine synthesis and another that is a transporter responsible for packaging dopamine into vesicles from which it is later released upon stimulation
2836233 obesity has so far been approached mostly as a metabolic rather than as an addictive disorder and obesity research has primarily focused on brain systems that regulate body weight through the maintenance of energy balance the current study challenges this approach by focusing on brain pathways implicated in pleasure and reward these pathways could override energy balance and induce hyperphagia and obesity by altering the reward value of food particularly palatable high energy food very early in life
2836234 now we know why so many people stay addicted to food it fuels the mid brain pleasure machinery we eat not only for nourishment but also for pleasure this study provides the molecular link between eating and mental health

2836277 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
2836278 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
2836279 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
2836280 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
2836281 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
2836282 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2836283 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2836284 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2836285 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2836286 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2836287 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2836288 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2836289 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2836290 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2836291 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2836292 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2836293 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2836294 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2836295 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2836296 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2836297 is designed to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind
2836298 loony liberalism a kind of ideological m nage a trois between timothy leary karl marx and al gore
2836299 matriarchal environmentalist multicultural anti male anti family anti individual and public hygiene shibboleths are enforced by orwellian regulatory agencies commissions and tribunals better known as the smoke smut seat belt thought language and calorie police
2836300 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
2836301 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
2836302 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
2836303 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
2836304 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
2836305 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls
2836306 the jonah factor 13 spiritual steps to finding the job of a lifetime
2836307 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2836308 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2836309 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2836310 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2836311 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2836312 just so you all know we did set a record
2836313 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2836314 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2836315 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2836316 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2836317 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2836318 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2836319 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2836320 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2836321 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2836322 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2836323 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2836324 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2836325 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2836326 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2836327 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2836328 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2836329 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2836330 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2836331 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2836332 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2836333 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2836334 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2836335 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2836336 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2836337 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2836338 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2836339 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2836340 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2836341 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2836342 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2836343 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2836344 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2836345 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2836346 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2836347 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2836348 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2836349 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2836350 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2836351 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2836352 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2836353 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2836354 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2836355 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2836356 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2836357 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2836358 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2836359 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2836360 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2836361 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2836362 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2836363 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2836364 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2836365 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2836366 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2836367 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2836368 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2836369 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2836370 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
2836371 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
2836372 i want energy to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2836373 ive been going there as an individual businessman for 40 years to washington
2836374 the richer i got the more polite they were did i get anything done hell no
2836375 i want to get to a million people by the time congress comes back in after recess
2836376 if they see with me a million people that are gonna write to them say something to them put pressure on them theyre going to listen to us i can promise you that
2836377 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
2836378 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
2836379 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2836380 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
2836381 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
2836382 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
2836383 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
2836384 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach
2836385 he wasnt successful but he made a lot of money at it
2836386 eliminates peoples jobs and then asks the taxpayers to fund his new venture
2836387 american people are desperate for answers and if they get robbed in the process
2836388 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
2836389 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2836390 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2836391 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2836392 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
2836393 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2836394 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2836395 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
2836396 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
2836397 the one constant in republican victories in fall elections has been large margins in springfield and those surrounding counties
2836398 if you dont campaign hard in a region of the state that is growing that represents a lot of votes
2836399 a good performing republican will get 65 percent of the vote in greene and surrounding counties
2836400 this race will be fought and won in the margins
2836401 if youre a democrat and cant get north of 40 percent in greene county youre in trouble
2836402 a lot of things hes said have really turned off and angered a lot of people including greene county democrats
2836403 the threat of obama is enough to get the hard core conservatives out
2836404 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2836405 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2836406 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2836407 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2836408 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2836409 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2836410 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2836411 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2836412 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2836413 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2836414 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2836415 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2836416 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2836417 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2836418 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2836419 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2836420 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2836421 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2836422 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2836423 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2836424 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2836425 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2836426 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2836427 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2836428 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2836429 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2836430 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2836431 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2836432 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2836433 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2836434 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2836435 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2836436 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2836437 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2836438 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2836439 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2836440 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2836441 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2836442 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2836443 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2836444 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2836445 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2836446 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2836447 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2836448 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2836449 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2836450 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2836451 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2836452 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2836453 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2836454 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2836455 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2836456 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2836457 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2836458 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2836459 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2836460 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
2836461 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2836462 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2836463 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2836464 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2836465 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2836466 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2836467 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2836468 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2836469 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2836470 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2836471 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2836472 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2836473 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2836474 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2836475 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2836476 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2836477 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2836478 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2836479 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2836480 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2836481 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
2836482 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2836483 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2836484 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
2836485 are you better off now than you were four years ago
2836486 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2836487 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2836488 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2836489 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2836490 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2836491 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2836492 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2836493 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2836494 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2836495 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2836496 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2836497 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2836498 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2836499 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2836500 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2836501 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2836502 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2836503 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2836504 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2836505 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2836506 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2836507 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
2836508 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2836509 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2836510 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2836511 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2836512 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
2836513 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
2836514 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
2836515 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
2836516 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
2836517 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
2836518 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
2836519 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2836520 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
2836521 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2836522 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
2836523 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
2836524 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
2836525 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
2836526 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
2836527 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
2836528 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
2836529 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
2836530 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
2836531 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
2836532 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
2836533 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
2836534 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
2836535 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
2836536 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
2836537 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
2836538 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
2836539 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
2836540 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2836541 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2836542 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2836543 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2836544 there you go again thats exactly the politics of division that has led us to where we are in washington
2836545 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2836546 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2836547 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2836548 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2836549 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2836550 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2836551 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2836552 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2836553 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2836554 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2836555 the only issue that hit home is the war because of him
2836556 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2836557 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2836558 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2836559 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2836560 oh you cant just go on google and get them
2836561 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2836562 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2836563 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2836564 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2836565 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2836566 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2836567 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2836568 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2836569 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2836570 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2836571 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2836572 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2836573 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2836574 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2836575 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2836576 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2836577 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2836578 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2836579 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2836580 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2836581 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2836582 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
2836583 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2836584 channel 4 will not be in a hurry to commission him poor old durkin again
2836585 it is entirely appropriate that people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2836586 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2836587 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2836588 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2836589 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2836590 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
2836591 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2836592 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2836593 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2836594 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2836595 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2836596 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2836597 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2836598 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2836599 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2836600 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2836601 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2836602 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law

2836619 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2836620 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2836621 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2836622 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2836623 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2836624 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2836625 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2836626 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2836627 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2836628 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2836629 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2836630 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2836631 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2836664 we want to find out whether theres a role for messaging in the browser
2836665 the initial prototype is a primitive implementation with many bugs and subsequent versions will include changes that break functionality and delete all your messages making you start over from scratch
2836666 extensions are a great way to prototype functionality in firefox
2836667 but i want to stress that this is a labs experiment and doesnt mean were adding this in firefox
2836668 the reason why were conducting this experiment with snowl is because we dont know if messaging should be in the browser but we want to find out that and a lot of other things
2836669 we want to gather as much feedback as possible then make the decision to continue if it seems promising and adds significant value to the browser
2836670 those are the questions we need to address but its still a successful experiment even if something doesnt make it into the browser
2836671 we could add some core messaging functionality to firefox or take just a piece of snowl to put in the browser or maybe do it some other way as a more mature extension separate from firefox
2836672 i think this is a project that will run more than just months
2836673 its hard to believe that within three to six months we would add messaging to firefox this is a rough estimate but i think its a one to two year thing

2836693 it is getting increasingly difficult to separate the good news from the bad in fact they are often one and the same

2836829 he is a physical player and he had a real nice break up from a big hit he could have intercepted it as the ball hung on the tight ends back forever kind of like a spindle just sitting there spinning there on his back all he had to do was reach up there and pick it off but he made the hit and he is doing a good job at middle linebacker for us

2836846 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2836847 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2836848 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2836849 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2836850 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2836851 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2836852 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2836856 a lot of advertising companies blatantly target children without any consideration for the parents of those children
2836857 it is incredibly sad to hear how many youngsters are bullied or isolated for not having the same clothes or accessories as their classmates
2836858 advertising and marketing have made our society increasingly image conscious and our children are suffering the consequences
2836859 schools and colleges should be places where all children feel equal but it is virtually impossible for schools to protect their pupils from the harsher aspects of these commercial influences
2836860 we are worried these pressures will further intensify as schools and colleges look for more help from commercial sponsors to provide it sports and science equipment teaching materials and food
2836861 advertising and marketing are just a small part of a much wider range of influences on children in todays consumer society childrens attitudes and values are primarily formed by the culture they live in and their personal contacts their families and friends
2836862 the advertising industry in the uk takes a responsible approach and there are strong and effective advertising controls that require special care to be taken as regards children

2836909 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui
2836910 quando la carta mi tagli il dito lo alzai per esaminare il danno dalla ferita invisibile colava una minuscola goccia di sangue poi accadde tutto molto velocemente edward si lanci verso di me scagliandomi dallaltra parte del tavolo ero caduta vicino al pianoforte gettando le braccia in avanti per proteggermi in mezzo alle schegge di vetro affilate dal polso al gomito ormai il dolore minvadeva acuto e bruciante confusa e disorientata cercai di non badare al rosso vivo del sangue che mi colava dal braccio e incrociai gli sguardi eccitati di sei vampiri improvvisamente famelici
2836911 nel silenzio assoluto unintuizione improvvisa rimise ogni dettaglio al suo posto cera qualcosa di cui edward non aveva voluto parlarmi qualcosa che jacob non mi avrebbe tenuta nascosta qualcosa che aveva attirato i cullen e i lupi nella foresta e li aveva fatti avvicinare pericolosamente tuttavia stavo aspettando proprio quel momento lo temevo ed ero pronta ad affrontarlo malgrado desiderassi con tutta me stessa che non arrivasse mai ma i miei guai non potevano aver fine vero

2836976 the feedback we are hearing is that the incremental updates to the software dont merit a new product every year
2836977 given this we have decided against releasing a 2009 version of money plus
2836978 in response to our retail partners needs consumer behavior and business efficiencies microsoft is focusing distribution efforts for microsoft money plus software online via download and discontinuing traditional box sales of the software at retail
2836979 microsoft money plus will continue to be available at retail outlets while supplies last we have stopped shipping new product to retail outlets
2836980 the story of the whole series was they got guys on base and got them in and we got guys on base and didnt unless they made a mistake

2836990 these allegations are serious and if true certainly a cause for concern
2836991 just the fact that this is being widely publicized will act as an enticement for hackers to exploit the alleged weaknesses in the processors that said i believe that the author may be entering into the land of hyperbole when he says that these bugs can be exploited regardless of operating system or other security measures that certainly needs to be proven

2837048 the reasoning behind the courts decision will not be announced for a long time

2837050 if the decision was taken by consensus which was obviously the case the justification needs to be penned by consensus this requires a long time its delay will give the opportunity to make the necessary arrangements that constitutional court president ha im k l pointed to the planned amendments to the constitution should be made while taking into account the reasoning behind the courts decision moreover the decision for rejection concerns the party whereas the reason is related to the entire politics and the legal system because this reason and justification will draw the limits and borders on freedom of expression and assembly therefore the limits and quality of democracy will also be drawn
2837051 if the courts justification is compatible with the european convention on human rights and if it is based on the right to organize the court would announce this without any delay there are of course problems with regards to the method the constitutional court relied on in reaching its decision to impose a financial ban on the government party if the justification they will announce is not compatible with democracy then the later they announce it the better it will be

2837096 if the courts justification is compatible with the european convention on human rights and if it is based on the right to organize the court would announce this without any delay there are of course problems with regards to the method the constitutional court relied on in reaching its decision to impose a financial ban on the government party if the justification they will announce is not compatible with democracy then the later they announce it the better it will be
2837097 from october on important arrangements will be made depending on international conjecture we will support all issues and moves that will contribute to our interests however our estimates on the roles to be assigned to turkey are not positive it seems that our party is the only resistance to the scenario assigned to turkey we are prepared to deal with any provocations seeking to break down the resistance of the mhp

2837117 but he chose me and i agreed to marry him right away
2837118 at least 20 percent of the families on the island have been lifted out of poverty
2837119 we were angry at each other in a quiet way
2837120 a marriage that is not based on love often brings problems
2837121 how can you live happily ever after when you met your husband three weeks before the wedding
2837122 any country will do ill take anyone who will accept me
2837123 we had to work no matter how hot it was no matter how much it rained from 5 in the morning until 5 in the afternoon sometimes we could only afford rice porridge
2837124 its my destiny to be poor if i had another daughter id ask her to marry a foreigner
2837125 taiwanese women want to get married when they are much older and they are also very opinionated
2837126 no one ever came on our trip without finding their dream bride

2837164 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on us russian relations
2837165 we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side
2837166 i hereby confirm that the moskva and the smetlivy have come into the port of novorossiisk
2837167 western countries behaved strangely in the first hours of aggression towards south ossetia they were silent
2837168 this raises very serious questions about sincerity and their attitude towards our country and will of course be taken into account in the future when we hold talks and talk about global issues
2837169 our position is of course negative it will of course be expressed when our minister sergei lavrov speaks on the phone with secretary of state condoleezza rice
2837170 our stance would not change with sanctions or the threat of sanctions
2837171 it is important that our country is ready to insist on its rights under any conditions
2837172 in deciding to liberate south ossetia or as he called it yesterday morning restoring the constitutional order georgian president mikheil saakashvili has committed an enormous error perhaps the georgian president had craftily bargained that on friday the day that the olympic games began the russians would remain neutral if so he was being naive since moscow would never let such an opportunity pass it by
2837173 the conflict in ossetia is not a local brawl in some obscure corner of europe its an explosion of one of several time delayed mines that remain since the collapse of the soviet union there are quite a few places like south ossetia where most residents oppose their new governments politicians in both moscow and the west like tinkering with these mines using them against one another and over recent years have done little to disarm them the drama which began yesterday in the caucasus shows how dangerous these games are and that the time has come to stop them this morally dubious game being played on both sides could inflame additional conflicts and end badly for russia in the caucasus for the west it may destabilize ukraine where crimea where russias black sea fleet in located is as hostile to their countrys government as the south ossettians are to theirs
2837174 the sale of glendronach is making good progress and we expect to complete the sale by september
2837175 although the two brands are quite different in their story the liquid is equally wonderful
2837176 we have been on a journey with macallan we are now number two in the world by value we talk about value rather than volume we aim to be a brand that sells by the highest price point but because the spirit is absolutely worth it because we spend more making it better than anybody else
2837177 it was an innovation that cemented our luxury cachet which was quite crucial i identified lalique as making the worlds best crystal
2837178 i am charged by the business to make sure that we have wonderful branded properties that we can burnish the macallan will become the number one by value in its category but also one of the truly legendary luxury brands in the world along brands like cartier bently jaeger lecoultre
2837179 scotch in russia has much higher cachet than almost any other spirits category
2837180 it is seen as having the old world cue of classic luxury an internationally recognised symbol of an individual
2837181 the consumer in russia has huge spending power they can afford to buy the best they are incredibly demanding about specification and story and engagement in the story we are the perfect brand to work with them on that
2837182 we are very scottish and we make every pound we spend work very very hard
2837183 very often the most satisfying innovation is where you have the most intense constraint it forces you to be extra innovative
2837184 people will now think hard about what is really important to them in life and they will spend on things that really matter
2837185 people will say this is important i love this moment of contemplation you might wait a year to renew your car you might put of a big vacation but you can still go in of an evening and have the most sublime experience by pouring a bottle of macallan in a glass
2837186 every day i have a different audience and every day i have got to be better than the day before
2837187 that was very nice and that was personal thing and very kind of them really we have a wonderful and special brand that was built carefully in the 1970s
2837188 i look at myself as one of the cathedral builders hopefully as one of the architects as opposed to one of the freemasons my major concentration is looking at what the brand will be in 20 years time
2837189 at times girl talks album sounds like a cleverly programmed k tel compilation that presents catchy riffs instead of full songs and part of the fun is recognizing familiar sounds in a new context

2837222 i dont think a and b is about quality its about ability to get on to radio
2837223 the point about a single is it needs airplay so you get the album too its the commercial radio factor that decides a and b

2837270 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2837271 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2837272 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2837273 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2837274 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2837275 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2837276 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities in balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter

2837327 i was told the whale sharks skin was rough so i took a scraper along with me and scratched its back it slowed down the next day it returned and i did the same thing it obviously enjoyed it by day three it was there waiting to have its back scratched
2837328 but the demon shark still remained a mystery to me
2837329 we also had about 500 giraffe zebra impala warthog but particularly special were the leopards

2837331 the raf and british troops the kenya police and the general service units were the main forces against the mau mau however the pseudo gangs were very effective of european origin but kenya bred
2837332 we would give them a nice soft leaf to use after they had been to the toilet but under it would be a stinging nettle
2837333 i even played rugby against idi amin he was a popular second row forward in the kings african rifles
2837334 i found that they knew everything there was to know about the biology of sharks but were sadly lacking about shark behaviour and i wanted to know more about these animals that people had such a phobia about

2837337 they make the decision who makes the team and who sits on the bench we hope they exercise that power to get this problem stopped
2837338 this is so much larger a problem than the general public is aware of
2837339 our first objective is raising awareness about how big of a problem it really is and not just continuing to deny that it is not going on in my school or district second is to educate parents coaches and teachers about how dangerous this drug really is
2837340 it is not typical of what we usually run into with the coaching community nationally
2837341 the kids sometimes dont like to hear it because its hard work to do it the right way and coaches are sometimes hesitant to deal with the steroid problem because that might be their starting quarterback or whatever hopefully we left them with the message that it can be a life or death issue

2837347 the olympic rings are on display practically anywhere you look in lake placid
2837348 weve seen business boom because theres that big thing of the olympics
2837349 there are always people that come in with a big draw to lake placid because they want to see what happened in 1980 with the miracle on ice
2837350 while theyre out here they see how athletically inclined this town is and that there were locals who competed like lowell bailey and tim burke
2837351 fishing in general is not an olympic sport but you would hope that it would at least bring interest in the outdoors

2837372 the first official message ever in which he speaks english
2837373 calls for the people to support jihad in pakistan and lists a litany of grievances against the pakistani government and us involvement there
2837374 let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilize this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
2837375 also relates his own personal experiences having lived in pakistan in an apparent attempt to build a stronger connection with the pakistani people

2837379 1 examine whether a regional system to provide indigent health care should be offered throughout the region 2 examine whether there should be a mechanism for additional counties to participate in the regional health care system 3 perform a review of funding and financing options including a review of funding indigent health care in the region
2837380 the initial meeting of the committee must take place before september 30 2007 at the initial meeting the committee shall 1 adopt rules governing the committee and 2 establish a work plan and schedule for future meetings
2837381 i thought the task force had made some progress towards bringing together some of the different stakeholders in health district 3 i asked you to have your office update me on future meeting schedules and agendas
2837382 when i said that i was looking forward to the public hearing phase of the task force meetings you replied that there would be no public hearings that the purpose of the task force was to allow only
2837383 you further asserted that hb 3154 made no provision for public hearings
2837384 thank you for your email please let me clarify the issue i was the author of hb 3154 i know the intent and purpose of this legislation all meetings are open to the public however because there is no specific legislation filed there will not be outside testimony beyond the parameters of those participants as outlined in hb 3154
2837385 but the committee was working hard on getting the report done by the deadline

2837389 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2837390 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2837391 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2837392 it was an opportunity to go over to china and do something that has probably not been done in the past go to china and do some comedy
2837393 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
2837394 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
2837395 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
2837396 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely
2837397 we still did what we wanted to do but i was hurrying it up saying come on come on lets go it was a subconscious thing
2837398 jon always has a very good sense of whats in good taste and bad
2837399 and well try to stay within the bounds of what we think is good taste we didnt go in there to make fun of the chinese people at all

2837403 it was an honor for us to be in this game i thought the chinese team and our team both played extremely hard i was proud of our effort
2837404 we have great respect for the chinese team and the chinese people and i thought that was displayed in the effort that we showed it showed a great deal of respect for the level of play and the country that china is
2837405 si no hay patria para todos no habr patria para nadie
2837406 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2837407 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2837408 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2837411 advertising needs to be done regularly to be effective and is often too costly for small businesses alternatively a small company can write its own press releases to gain access to editorial space which is free and has more credibility than an advert

2837415 we have used resound training twice to deliver our diversity and equality training
2837416 resounds strengths are their preparation and tailoring to local circumstances gill is also a strong and confident facilitator and course designer important qualities when designing bespoke training and dealing with sensitive and emotive issues
2837417 thank you for all the work you and your team put into making the event informative fun and subsequently very successful the actors were all fantastic weve had extremely positive feedback from both service users and professionals
2837418 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2837419 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2837420 now its my mistress your betrayal knows no end and you will feel the repercussions of what you helped to bring about you are nothing of mine i give you to those whom you betrayed the most and they may do as they see fit with you

2837444 havendo testes r pidos que se podem fazer num minuto em qualquer lugar que n o necessitam de tecnologia muito complicada as campanhas de rastreio podiam ser muito maiores
2837445 falam de 2015 como um horizonte suficientemente bom e parecem sentir se bem ao deixar escapar o objectivo de 2010 refere a oxfan em comunicado

2837456 n s temos que apoiar esses programas eu n o acho que temos escolha mas pode se questionar se esses programas t m uma responsabilidade com as mulheres
2837457 ningu m vai estender um tapete vermelho para o envolvimento das mulheres na circuncis o masculina deixar de ser v timas s depende das mulheres

2837486 there will probably be guerilla warfare all over the country
2837487 but the russians are not letting them withdraw they are pursuing them and people are seeing this

2837597 i just got my sales license youll have to come on down to the dealership ill sell you a car
2837598 when you negotiate this sheet should be covered with numbers
2837599 it should be like a battleground and i dont want to see the price dropping five hundred dollars at a pop come down slowly slowly here ill show you how
2837600 then you just say 300 up to and theyll say well 350 now theyve just bumped themselves 50 a month thats huge
2837601 you have to break them inside make them understand that if they want our beautiful new car theyre going to have to pay for it
2837602 you say yes sir i have the jones family here with me and they have just driven a beautiful new whatever model stock number blah blah blah then you say is it still available of course you know it is but you want to create a sense of urgency so you pause then say to the customer great news the cars still available then the tower will give you the first pencil write it in each of the boxes
2837603 these numbers arent coming from you youre still the good guy theyre coming from someone on the other end of the phone the enemy
2837604 ok so when you give these numbers to the customer you say heres a pretty good deal for you but mr customer says oh man michael i told you i can only put down 3 000 so you cross out the 6 000 you wrote and put down 5 750 you say to the customer is that more what you had in mind and you nod as you say this try to get them agreeing with you
2837605 heres another thing never give the customer even numbers then it looks like you just made them up so dont say their monthly payment is going to be 400 say it will be 427 or if you want to have some fun say it will be 427 33
2837606 oh this is a good one this is how you steal the trade in
2837607 when youre getting the numbers from the desk theyll ask if the customer has a trade in say its a 95 ford taurus and say you took it to the used car manager and he evaluated it and said he would pay four grand for it if you can get the trade for only three thats a grand extra in profit
2837608 you ask the desk what did we get for the last three tauruses at auction then theyll give you some figures theyll say 1 923 2 197 and 1 309 you dont have to say anything to the customer but he sees you writing this down and hes going holy crap i thought my trade was worth 6 000 now its easy to get it for 3 000 thats a grand extra in profit and its front end money too
2837609 very important you need to get to know these cars inside and out
2837610 naw training materials stuff for companies to train the people that work there
2837611 its easy man youll do good hey ill show you around
2837612 youre walking through the lot with mr customer and hes eyeballing all these cars
2837613 he stops next to this one and bam thats the one youre gonna sell him you pull it out of the row open the doors and ask him to see how good the seats feel when he sits down you slam the door and take off
2837614 you mean you ask him if he wants to demo the car
2837615 hell no they never go for a demo if you ask them cause they know theyre weak if they drive it theyll buy it the feel of the wheel will seal the deal my friend so you got to kidnap them man just slam the door and take off come on lets go
2837616 now you got them away from the dealership you can relax a little show em how awesome this car is what you want to do is open all the doors and windows the hood and the trunk then you do your walk around you start at the drivers door and you point stuff out as you go mr customer this cars got the highest safety rating because its got front crumple zones and breakaway engine mounts its got a 170 horsepower v6 with four valves per cylinder and blah blah blah see it doesnt really matter what you say most people dont even know what the hell youre talking about but the important thing is to keep talking heres the headlights heres the gas cap heres the trunk here are the tires anything understand
2837617 yeah you be mr customer you get behind the wheel see you got to be in control on the demo because when you get back to the lot you got to get them in the box and make a deal
2837618 see the test drive route is just a bunch of right turns if you want to go a little farther go straight there

2837728 although there may be near infinite selection of all media there is still a scarcity of human attention

2837773 the essence of league tables is you take one little thing and whack it in a list and say thats all you need to know about your local school
2837774 what we want to know is very comprehensive information about who is in each school because that would tell you something about educational need
2837775 we need to know where that disadvantage lies and we need to know the best methods of addressing it
2837776 what we are better off identifying is the kind of extra value that education offers so that we measure the progress people are making not the raw results
2837777 all information other than those things of course that are subject to privacy provisions should be made open and accountable to parents to the broader community

2837796 i like to just walk around in it sit on the purple bench and marvel at how fast a vegetable garden goes from bare ground to lush growth
2837797 there were several garden bloggers who indicated they were going to shut down their blogs in the fall because without an active garden what would they have to write about what thinking about gardening is a year round activity for a gardening geek
2837798 we can have flowers nearly every month of the year
2837799 gardeners have found on the web a way to share their gardens and get gardening information that other generations of gardeners could never have imagined

2837814 theres very little government does that needs to be locked up sealed behind closed doors
2837815 understood that government must be practiced in the public square that absolute power is ripe for corruption this is why we in the d c government have mounted more data feeds than anywhere else in the world
2837816 is to have activists out there looking at our data slicing and dicing it and providing approaches and connections we may not have thought of
2837817 the more the meters run the more money we make

2837820 the best of his poems stand with the most achieved work of his generation
2837821 i was even philosophically convinced that as i liked to put it if according to aristotle poetry is more philosophical than history so is it more philosophical than philosophy the work id have had to do in philosophy would be to lay out the grounds for privileging poetry which indeed our era has been more or less doing vide heidegger rorty derrida etc
2837822 the central vision in preambles is of the mind ceaselessly an activity engaged in the suffering process of working apart all things that are joined by it
2837823 a tragedy of the mind victim to its own intent which is to make by separations
2837824 opposition between the imaginative self and reality seems as central to these poems as it was to stevens and as grandly articulated
2837825 poetry is always close kin to the impossible isnt it
2837826 the belief in a serene and generous fulfillment of natural loving desires destroys ideologies which blind maim and repress and points the way to a kind of community which would amaze moralists and transform armies of men who are fighters because they cannot be lovers
2837827 younger writers who have been associated with and in some cases influenced by the leading writers of the preceding groups but who have evolved their own original styles and new conceptions of poetry
2837828 occasionally arbitrary and for the most part more historical than actual
2837829 following the practice and precepts of ezra pound and william carlos williams the new poetry has built on their achievements and gone on to evolve new conceptions of the poem these poets have already created their own tradition an interesting feat their own press and their own public they are our avant garde the true continuers of the modern movement in american poetry
2837830 like the avant garde clusters that came after them much in fact like the impressionists the pre raphaelites were united more by what they detested than what they valued
2837831 has shown one common characteristic a total rejection of all those qualities typical of academic verse
2837832 this is the main function of being identified with a group or school to draw critical attention that individual poets not affiliated with a movement or group cannot easily attract new york school or language poetry are given brand name status commodifying and homogenizing so that critics and poets can make general identifications and totalizing critiques without having to actually contend with the specific differences among and between so called members of the group
2837833 not more say to live than what there is to live i want the poem as close to this fact as i can bring it or it me
2837834 i am put down by beat natives who say that i cannot be beat and committed at the same time
2837835 the non commitment of the artist is itself a suicidal and deluded variation of nihilism
2837836 the style of ferlinghettis poetry is virtually mainstream in its transparent use of language and narrative tendency
2837837 there is no political revolt all revolt is person and is against interior attitudes and images or against exterior bindings of society that constrict and cause pain
2837838 a political revolution is a revolt of men against a lovestructure that has gone bad
2837839 the use of a man by himself and thus by others lies in how he conceives his relation to nature that force to which he owes his somewhat small existence
2837840 the activist marxian perspective implicit in the french language mao quotations is somewhat modulated by olson throughout the kingfisher toward a more purely qualitative notion of dialectical process and change
2837841 poets dont sing about society they sing about nature even if the closest they ever get to nature is their ladys queynt class structured society is a kind of mass ego to transcend the ego is to go beyond society as well
2837842 the rhythms of my poems follow the rhythm of the physical work im doing and life im leading at any given time
2837843 at the root of where our civilization goes wrong is the mistaken belief that nature is something less than authentic that nature is not as alive as man is or as intelligent that in a sense it is dead
2837844 i dont think about fame or posterity as keats so grandly and genuinely did nor do i care about clarifying experiences for anyone or bettering other than accidentally anyones state or social relation nor am i for any particular technical development in the american language simply because i find it necessary what is happening to me allowing for lies and exaggerations which i try to avoid goes into my poems i dont think my experiences are clarified or made beautiful for myself or anyone else they are just there in whatever form i can find them
2837845 a poem does not have to be a major thing or a statement poems are my salvation alone the reader can do with them what he likes
2837846 poetry even tho it does deal with language is no more holy act than say shitting discharge
2837847 against the works of unworthy men unfeeling judgments and cruel deeds
2837848 years of our rapport were wrecked by war and the scars upon the land
2837849 duncans argument with levertov was that the poet cant serve two masters a poetry of political commitment yokes the imagination to a priori truths and concerns thus limiting the power of the imagination
2837850 opening the gates of the imagination the duncan levertov letters
2837851 i do not believe that a violent imitation of the horrors of our time is the concern of poetry horrors are taken for granted disorder is ordinary people in general take more and more in their stride hides grow thicker i long for poems of an inner harmony in utter contrast to the chaos in which they exist insofar as poetry has a social function it is to awaken sleepers by other means than shock
2837852 the intellect by itself may point out the source of suffering but the imagination illuminates it by that light it becomes more comprehensible
2837853 whereas levertov moved toward a romantic voice and a commonly understood language as the vehicles of protest poetry creeley and duncan continued to maintain that political critiques and poetic originality emerged only from experimental poetry that challenged the norms of syntax and poetic form
2837854 my poetry is angelical ravings amp has nothing to do with dull materialistic vagaries about who should shoot who the secrets of individual imagination which are transconceptual amp nonverbal i mean unconditioned spirit are not for sale to this consciousness are of no use to this world except perhaps to make it shut its trap amp listen to the music of the spheres
2837855 you can start out with an idea that you want to write about how terrible it is that president johnson is an asshole rs ah those were the days and you can come up with a good poem but it will just be by chance and will undoubtedly not just say that president johnson is an asshole and will really have a different meaning than you started with i mean if you want to write a letter to the editor then it seems to me the thing to do is write a letter to the editor it doesnt seem to me that poetry is for that
2837856 our particular grasp on say a melican speech b poetries of the world c our selves which is attitudes logics theories jumbles of our lives amp all that d and the final the totality of mind spiritual god or you name it social zeitgeist or heideggerian umwelt
2837857 that to be avant garde is a political position before it is an aesthetic one that it assumes a negative outsiders stance toward aesthetic establishments and institutions
2837858 the left has no monopoly of change there are right wing revolutionaries as well
2837859 there is no automatic link between political views and artistic talent
2837860 reasons of race and religion combine to make large numbers of free thinking jews undesirable
2837861 in society there is a revolt of revolt a hysteria often more visible though perhaps not more present than true revolt it is nihilistic and dissipative the man caught up by revolt by revolt is either weak in genetic spirit or dominated by circumstance he makes a hysterical or passionate attempt to take any other path than the one laid for him by society
2837862 schoenberg was at pains to emphasize the impossibility of distinguishing between artistic acts of spontaneous expression and deliberate construction
2837863 the seemingly paradoxical fusion of technical calculation and emotional spontaneity that gives bergs music its particular fascination
2837864 for a group of composers compelled like so many of their creative contemporaries to withdraw from the commitment to a consensual form of expression linguistic reinvention of the medium was never allowed to become the abstract end in itself that subsequent theoretical codification might suppose
2837865 you are not modern you are merely expressing yourself according to the coordinates of your time and thats not being modern thats being what you are
2837866 can i truly speak this language can this language speak through me
2837867 what happens to our reading of stevens poetry when the problem of how the mind links up with reality i e epistemology is no longer of any concern to us
2837868 questions about nature reality or the world began to be reformulated as questions about mind or spirit
2837869 there came a time when questions about language and also therefore questions about mind and reality began to be reformulated as questions about social practice
2837870 language as just another mental product just didnt have much reality for stevens
2837871 for stevens success in experience means hearing no ones voice but your own one can then enter into a new world without any loss of self possession
2837872 poetry is a poetic conception however expressed a poem is poetry expressed in words
2837873 in a poem there is a poetry of words obviously a poem may consist of several poetries
2837874 the poet is a poet insofar as he accepts the idea of a unitary and singular language and a unitary monologically sealed off utterance
2837875 the world of poetry no matter how many contradictions and insoluble conflicts the poet develops within it is always illumined by one unitary and indisputable discourse contradictions conflicts and doubts remain in the subject in thoughts in living experience in short in the subject matter but they do not enter the language itself in poetry even discourse about doubts must be cast in a discourse that cannot be doubted
2837876 s ound in such a text the ideal type of which would be the book to which mallarm s texts aspire aspires not to the illusion of someone speaking but to the formal conditions of music
2837877 plays out the drama of the fear and repression of alien voices
2837878 he is a poet troubled by the sort of poetry he is not writing and perhaps cant bring himself to think of as poetic the poetry of the other
2837879 the slippage from the otherness of what is repressed in ordinary acts of communication to the other obscures the specificity of actual social others the very generality of the other suggests a totalizing system likely to disregard differences of race gender class culture and history
2837880 we are conceived in your that is the poets conceits
2837881 highlight s notions of difference marginality and otherness in such a way that it further marginalizes actual people of difference and otherness
2837882 if you show too much emotion of whatever kind that then defines you forever and you dont have the opportunity to present yourself in any nuanced or multifaceted way
2837883 what the public wants is not passion but the appearance of passion
2837884 a sequence of poems for h d s 73rd birthday
2837885 i will not say that such a passage is an imposition on the heterosexual reader
2837886 its duncans lack of irony about his vocation as well as about the possibilities and functions of both imagination and language that makes him most vulnerable to our postmodern distrust
2837887 despite his popularity puccini creates discomfort in this hyper stylized ironic age because he deals in direct emotion and avoids ideology and moralism
2837888 too often distaste for sentiment anxiety at the limitations of the self create contempt for feeling as though feeling were what was left over after the great work of the mind was finished
2837889 poetry is not a turning loose of emotion but an escape from emotion
2837890 only those who have personality and emotions know what it means to want to escape from these things
2837891 we are suffering from too much sarcasm i feel any touch of unfeigned gusto in our smart press is accompanied by an arch word implying now to me of course this is a bit asinine blessed is the man who does not sit in the seat of the scoffer
2837892 it is all wrong my intelligence protests but it is a commanding confession of my true state
2837893 like the best of museum curators reginald shepherd has trusted his own poets eye and ear in assembling poems by twenty three of our best mostly younger poets poets not usually linked belonging as they do to different schools and movements from rosmarie waldrops ironic prose poems i gave up stress for distress to cole swensens elegant ekphrastic prose from c s giscombes minimalist geographies to susan stewarts resonant mythic landscapes the dominant impression rare today produced by this lyric assemblage is that of quality the sure hand of those who have mastered their craft and can therefore make it new this is a truly exciting and memorable anthology
2837894 all the anthologies of contemporary poetry i know are far too generous they seem incapable of excluding almost anyone who has gained any reputation and then they have to compensate for their breadth by such scanty selections there is no possibility of depth not so with reginald shepherds lyric postmodernisms shepherd had the courage to select 23 poets spanning two generations then offer them enough space to provide statements on their aesthetics display their range including selections from long poems and uncollected texts this anthology treats poets not just as makers of objects but as thinkers with visible and engaging projects who bring lyric consciousness into almost every domain of active life here lyric can have its fullest meaning only if there are many more than one postmodernism as shepherd elaborates in his brilliant and concise introduction
2837895 people who follow the arts like to talk about schools often they prefer talking about schools and trends to talking about individual poets and their poems
2837896 part of whats so interesting about the current moment is its refusal of an overtly oedipal relation to literary traditions on either the right or the left and a willingness to construct and invent not only new kinds of poetry but new ways of reading
2837897 whether a school exists or where its boundaries lie seem questions both less profound and less durable than the questions we ask about each poet and about individual poems at the same time individual poems may respond to their historical moment and invoke their stylistic formal and thematic affinities with other poems
2837898 intentionally blurs the distinction between difficulty and accessibility preferring instead to address a continuum of utterance
2837899 compositional complexity and a renewed emphasis on abstraction are the cornerstones of the new modernism it has some of the difficulty of modernism but little of its commitment to history and myth rs i would disagree with this i would say that it has a different relationship to history and myth not relying upon them as sources of authority but as fields of what foucault called the archaeology of knowledge in its love of the fragment mosaic organization broken sequences and appropriation the new modernism also resembles the old what differs is the gender and ethnicity of the poets involved
2837900 poets like ann lauterbach marjorie welish michael palmer jorie graham rosmarie waldrop nathaniel mackey donald revell and bob perelman rs this seems an odd assemblage to me at least in terms of professed and apparent poetic lineages whose work contains figured abstraction and at times sustained lyrical argument and are influenced by the romantic lineage of postmodernism including ashbery and duncan
2837901 poets like lyn hejinian susan howe bruce andrews ron silliman and charles bernstein whose origins are in gertrude stein objectivism and charles olson and employ a more discontinuous compositional program
2837902 elliptical poets are always hinting punning or swerving away from a never quite unfolded backstory they are easier to process in parts than in wholes
2837903 all elliptical poets want to convey both metaphysical challenge and recognizable seen or tasted detail ellipticism rejects poems written in order to demonstrate theories prettiness as its own end slogans mysticism straight up narrative and extended abstraction rs contrarily i would say that one distinguishing feature of post avant garde poetry is its interest and even its investment in exploring abstraction as a mode and a theme something that paul hoover touches on in the passage quoted above ellipticals are uneasy about less often hostile to inherited elites and privileges but they are not populists and wont write down to or connect the dots for their readers their difficulty conveys respect
2837904 is listing traits that have been present in various innovative writing communities for decades and attributing them to a very narrow and relatively both conservative and recent group of writers
2837905 a of relating to or marked by ellipsis or an ellipsis in turn defined as a the omission of one or more words that are obviously understood but that must be supplied to make a construction grammatically complete or b a sudden leap from one topic to another b 1 of relating to or marked by extreme economy of speech or writing 2 of or relating to deliberate obscurity as of literary or conversational style
2837906 ellipticism counts as a school of a movement in the way that metaphysical poetry or confessional poetry count as movements not in the way that language writing or the black arts movement or new formalism each of which had manifestos count as movements the so called by burt himself ellipticals like the so called metaphysicals need not have signed a manifesto or appeared in one place at one time in order to share the aesthetic goals i have described
2837907 historically a school is based is based on more than observable surface similarities sometimes in fact the members of a given group have differed widely in their works appearances approaches and other immediate aspects and have based their affinity instead on much broader aesthetic issues as well as at times shared social and political convictions and some degree of shared experience as the term has been used throughout the century a school is a spontaneous and accidental situation that laces people together as it laces art into individual lives using the term at this point in history does imply those extra textual affinities which im not sure are appropriate here
2837908 if not to construct then at least to arrange the territory before it sets out to guide us through it
2837909 a variation on the trendiest contemporary style which relies heavily on disconnected phrases abrupt syntactical shifts attention begging titles the gem is on page sixty four quirky diction orangery aigrettes flickering italics oddball openings the scent of pig is faint tonight and a tone ranging from daffy to plangent basically two scoops of john ashbery and a sprinkling of gertrude stein its not hard to write acceptable poetry in this mode
2837910 if its relatively easy to write passable poetry in the style du jour its never easy to write good poetry in any style
2837911 younger poets today i think have more of an opportunity of learning from all worlds without having to sign up amp pick sides and that in turn will itself impact how writing gets done going forward
2837912 the third way has always struck me as predicated upon the existence of the other two
2837913 one of the most passionate advocates of a return to lyric modernism in contemporary poetry
2837914 trying to figure out how to incorporate both lyric and non if not anti lyric impulses and trying to put modernist fragmentation together with romantic expectations about voice and form
2837915 the post avant seems to have very little interest in making grand claims of any kind not only does it eschew a sense of heroic poetic progress but it eschews big political or spiritual claims
2837916 any such unqualified agenda of poetic and institutional identification as donald m allen proclaimed when he pronounced that all the poets included in the new american poetry shared a total rejection of all those qualities typical of academic verse would seem inappropriate and somewhat na ve we have seen the blurring of such clear distinctions as those between academic and non academic schools of poetry between institutional structures and avant garde communities between insiders and outsiders
2837917 there are to be no next things the time for next things is past rs nice paradox it is like coming to the end of the world with no more continents to discover one must now begin to make habitable the only continents that there are
2837918 language poetry put the period on the end of the modernist sentence if youre playing an innovative game after language poetry theres no more deconstructive work to do that project has finished the next step then becomes a reconstructive project that sees language as a whole again moving information but like certain strains of postmodernism acknowledges the cracks in the newly reformed linguistic vessel
2837919 i often use william s burroughs collaborator brion gysins quote from 1959 that poetry is 50 years behind painting
2837920 the willingness of contemporary poets to use a spectrum of devices without undue prejudice
2837921 to anyone who has followed the visual arts during the past two decades or so or academic music in the decade prior to that the notion of an avant garde rs however or even whether one would define such a thing at this historical juncture without agonism will not seem very strange
2837922 we live in a time i think not of mainstream but of many streams or even if you insist upon a river of time that we have come to a delta maybe even beyond delta to an ocean which is going back to the skies
2837923 the new american mainstream retaining whatever oppositional force it still possesses only through institutional memory though it still stands strongly enough as a bulwark against the laziness and anti intellectualism of the genuine mainstream of american cultural life
2837924 current aesthetic quarrels and conversations between poets are real enough and the aesthetically abstract or non referential lyric poetry may have a different readership from poetry that announces its purposes in more narrative styles but these issues should concern poets far less than keeping poetry alive in a culture of appalling greed a culture that doesnt read much of anything a culture that does business as usual in a time of enron and retributionist wars
2837925 in much of the world today there is something like a democracy of creative expression where most everyone can say what they want about whatever even if some people are better able to have their voices heard and are more influential
2837926 theres no single way to evaluate the quality of art
2837927 the fact that theres no single way to evaluate the relative quality of works of art doesnt mean that all creative expression is the equal of every other
2837928 people often have the impression that pop culture and the arts used to be better this impression comes from the fact that in the long term we actually have good taste and this skews our memory of the past
2837929 objects of creative expression and i would include scholarly expression as much as art here that maintain the interest of many for very long though highly various tend to have objective qualities that reward repeated reflection and rumination i e theyre actually at least somewhat profound and that are not overly determined by the moment of their creation allowing them to communicate across temporal contexts
2837930 i can disown no link of this chain from my conscience
2837931 asked each of them separately what they thought of the others poetry and each of them said the same thing oh i cant read it
2837932 you do not have to choose between bishop and duncan any more than you have to choose between william blake and samuel johnson
2837933 how and why does conflict arise when gay and poetry are made to stand together in twentieth and twenty first century literary critical discourse even now the presence of gay and poetry together suggests a paradox for at its most descriptive gay is neither apolitical ahistorical nor morally neutral even as at its most politicized poetry can never not refer to specific traditions whose tropes and values are paradoxically alleged to transcend historical time even if they are bound as much to upholding cultural norms and values as they are to underwriting large historical shifts and flux even if these terms often come to represent ideological stress points within literary critical discourse their presence together still has the power to unsettle what assumptions we hold both about what it means to write and read poetry and what constitutes gay identity in fact whats most interesting about the proximity of gay to poetry is how each must shift definition to accommodate the other
2837934 very few poets have ever set out to be gay poets the dedication of poets is a large one perhaps one of the most enormous as our subject matter we aim at nothing less than everything and the idea of our initial dedication settling for anything less
2837935 why settle for part of the world when you can lay claim to the whole of it
2837936 to miss the gay elements in say marlowes or whitmans work has resulted in not only unbalanced views of them but in illegible word misreadings
2837937 to be a poet is more important than to be a gay poet
2837938 why is my impulse to write poetry so closely connected so much a part of my sexual impulse when i feel one i feel something very similar to the other i dont like this too much i mean i like it somewhat but i feel it necessary sometimes to steer my energy into nonsexual subjects almost by an act of will since i dont believe all the important parts of life are sexual and when i succeed in doing so im quite often successful yet it does even then derive from an energy that is sexual quite the same kind of concentrated excitement that lights up everything in a limited area as a flash light lights up everything in the circle it makes i wonder where this comes from i wonder how many other poets this happens to its my limitation
2837939 duncan started with little modern american precedent for speaking openly about homosexuality there is now a way of speaking about it and we may thank duncans continued example more than any other that it is not a specialized speech it is not separated from the heterosexuals tradition it is due more to duncan than to any other single poet that modern american poetry in all its inclusiveness can deal with overtly homosexual material so much as a matter of course not as something perverse or eccentric or morbid but as evidence of the many available ways in which people love or fail to love
2837940 i feel so old fashioned and embarrassed i dont mention anything but love
2837941 is it possible one wonders without rolling back advances for gays in the form of rights social cohesiveness and a greater earned sense of self esteem to push out the boundaries of our identification so they can apply less narrowly more generally the corollary for gays how to go beyond separatism without negating its advances
2837942 the tragedy of loss which has been inevitable anyway though who would have dreamed so dramatically is so great because of the essential optimism of the enterprise the possibility what is sketched out at the end of the sixties and embodied in the seventies is still alive and it is up to me to record it as well as i can
2837943 to be a poet is more important than to be a gay poet
2837944 what do we want gay rights when do we want them now
2837945 all kinds of favors fall from it some thoughts on becoming a blogger
2837946 a space for the kind of not knowingness that holds the promise of something to come
2837947 in the america of the 21st century the poet is a displaced person the queer poet doubly displaced thanks america for nothing if there can be a useful consequence of living as a second class citizen within this growing empire it is that the range of possible subjects and forms expands also
2837948 suited to engaging the themes not just suited to themes
2837949 have reflected the peculiarity of their social status by adapting correspondingly peculiar linguistic strategies
2837950 once one finds oneself to be para doxa freed from the logic of linguistic common sense and the natural urges of the syntax we have been taught all kinds of poetic dialects struggle to unfurl the tongue
2837951 no other writer of his generation defended homosexual desire as a fit subject for poetry as effectively as ginsberg
2837952 a vision of the world in which the asshole could be rather than a source of shame something deeply holy
2837953 no one sent me the memo that racism heterosexism and class struggle had ended and thus we can now put that silly business of the politics of identity behind us
2837954 society is beginning to say that being gay is not such a big deal demographer gary gates says
2837955 as the challenges associated with coming out diminish so does the primacy of the identity that that act of self discovery and self assertion once forged it means that the culture once associated with gay identity becomes less distinctive from the mainstream
2837956 orpheus in the bronx not only extols the freedom language affords us it embodies that freedom enacting poetrys greatest gift the power to recognize ourselves as something other than what we are these bracing arguments were written by a poet who sings
2837957 pounds gifts as an impresario were impressive much of the coherence of modernism as an institution derived from his canny capacity to bring together patrons journals and authors creating and then exploiting institutional opportunities
2837958 even the concept of music as bourgeois entertainment was not rejected out of hand by most avant garde composers whose belief in the rightness of their radicalism was based on the conviction that sooner or later the value of their music would be publicly culturally accepted and that such acceptance meant performance in conventional concert environments
2837959 from milk toast internationalist to brave mccain like warrior in under 24 hours
2837960 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2837961 too bad i cant get on it it would sink
2837962 there will be no working life conference this year we will be looking to hold events later in the year but the cost and lack of interest in working life conference last year means we are not going ahead this year
2837963 there was literally zero support from cchq for the entire time i was on the exec
2837964 i thought that karen allen and her team did a great job and had they had even the slightest bit of support from cchq they would have delivered but the fact is that cchq dont want to know about young professionals unless they are in donor clubs
2837965 its been 6 months since they started i am a young professional in london and this is the first time i have heard from the nme on working life and i bet im not the only one
2837966 all of you will be made to stumble this night for it is written
2837967 students would be encouraged to broaden their science education but would not be forced to do so
2837968 the choice to opt out and take double science would remain
2837969 reflect the importance of these skills to the uk economy
2837970 young people are missing out they are doing better than ever in science tests at 14 but hardly any are going on to study triple science gcse despite the opportunities and learning it offers
2837971 we need to create an environment in schools that reflects the importance of science and the value of studying it
2837972 we also need to send an unambiguous message to young people who are good at science that science as a career can be fascinating and worthwhile and will reward you well

2837975 la nota efectivamente existe pero la parte georgiana no ha cesado las operaciones militares en osetia del sur sus tropas contin an disparando
2837976 se ha visto un sentimiento del pueblo boliviano hacia la democracia y un sentimiento de profundizar este proceso de cambio
2837977 it was a rushed decision with politicians in mind i remember very well brendan nelson the then minister coming to the valley to join bob baldwin to make an announcement which i knew was not ready
2837978 and sadly now the army and the australian taxpayer are likely to be at a cost
2837979 this is another case of misadministration by this current government allowing specifications to be changed so that contracts can no longer stand
2837980 m s del 70 por ciento de las emisiones globales son generadas por las ciudades si esas emisiones no se miden no se pueden controlar

2837984 shed never achieved the kind of fame that her ambition required of her
2837985 long thwarted ambitious people tended to be suddenly much nicer when they got the attention they felt they deserved
2837986 maam excuse me can i have one of those they are my favorite
2837987 this morning well be talking with aluminium refinery workers in particular about what potential impact an emissions trading scheme will have on that industry in western australia but also how we can ensure that we dont lose any jobs in the meantime and that we are fixing up our environment
2837988 i think this week were starting to see our members saying well you know wed really like it to come to a head soon and if that means taking some more action then that means taking some more action
2837989 but certainly nothing will be put in place if we consider it has any negative affect on community but ii think certainly the community will see the effect of the bans more
2837990 people were always getting ready for tomorrow tomorrow wasnt getting ready for them it didnt even know they were there
2837991 demanding accountability is no game and theres nothing wrong with trying to understand who made mistakes who failed if no one is held accountable for their decisions for their actions all of this will happen again
2837992 there are a lot of people who love this area and are very very concerned about the way the area is heading
2837993 i think publishers have concluded that the only games that work are the surefire 500 million box office kind of games like spider man and shrek
2837994 the transformers game really surprised people how well it did but the movie was big i dont think they expected the dark knight movie to be this big
2837995 former president jimmy carter while serving as governor of georgia reported venus to the state police during world war ii a squadron of b 29 pilots mistook the planet for a japanese plane and tried to shoot it from the sky
2837996 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2837997 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2837998 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2837999 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2838000 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2838001 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2838002 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2838003 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2838004 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2838005 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2838006 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2838007 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2838008 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2838009 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2838010 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2838011 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2838012 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2838013 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2838014 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2838015 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2838016 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2838017 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2838018 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2838019 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2838020 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2838021 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2838022 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2838023 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2838024 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2838025 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2838026 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2838027 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2838028 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2838029 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2838030 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2838031 who are open to doing something on the production side
2838032 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2838033 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2838034 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2838035 lord do not let me be put to shame i trust in you
2838036 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2838037 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2838038 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2838039 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2838040 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2838041 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2838042 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2838043 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2838044 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2838045 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2838046 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2838047 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2838048 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2838049 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2838050 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2838051 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2838052 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2838053 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2838054 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2838055 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2838056 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2838057 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2838058 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2838059 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2838060 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2838061 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2838062 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2838063 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2838064 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2838065 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2838066 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2838067 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2838068 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2838069 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2838070 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2838071 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2838072 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2838073 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2838074 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2838075 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2838076 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2838077 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2838078 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2838079 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2838080 expect intel to focus even more marketing resources around that name and the core i7 products starting now
2838081 socialmedian is going to tackle the problem by offering users a volume bar i think this is freakin genius i hope it works like magic if so socialmedian will race to the top of the charts for social aggregators and it would be nice to see jason goldberg and his team be rewarded that way for their solid work
2838082 where can i get a phone that just makes calls
2838083 i think publishers have concluded that the only games that work are the surefire 500 million box office kind of games like spider man and shrek
2838084 the transformers game really surprised people how well it did but the movie was big i dont think they expected the dark knight movie to be this big
2838085 shifting the focus from social welfare to social development is about considering the wellbeing of the whole population and communities within that population rather than solely focusing on the traditional family group we must cater for the diversity we know exists by this i mean the range of relationships from single couples triples blended de facto and so on thats where were going with social policy
2838086 i think the defense had a much better go of it today
2838087 there were many more forced turnovers i was pleased with what i got out of the defensive effort today
2838088 that makes a heck of a lot of difference we were in much better position we put pressure on the quarterback all day long and those are good things
2838089 we made a decision to go with the two younger guys and daniel evans today
2838090 the word should only be used to describe shauna and nothing else

2838121 se propuso entonces tal era el objetivo deponer a las autoridades de la audiencia que obedec an a los franceses y nombrar a las autoridades criollas que gobernar an en nombre de fernando vii
2838122 el poder pol tico era sagrado y recib a de dios y no de los hombres y de su legalidad su legitimidad absoluta atentar contra l era ofender al orden natural que el creador hab a puesto en las cosas era factible s la existencia de gobernantes injustos como lo ser a fernando vii y la mayor a de los borbones pero como el estado no lo pose a todo como ahora el cabildo ejerc a un efectivo contrapeso impidiendo y contrarrestando la omnipotencia del poder pol tico

2838159 the end point is the community doesnt know whether it is getting value for money
2838160 it was an opportunity to go over to china and do something that has probably not been done in the past go to china and do some comedy
2838161 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
2838162 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
2838163 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
2838164 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely
2838165 we still did what we wanted to do but i was hurrying it up saying come on come on lets go it was a subconscious thing
2838166 jon always has a very good sense of whats in good taste and bad
2838167 and well try to stay within the bounds of what we think is good taste we didnt go in there to make fun of the chinese people at all

2838171 im a fairly approachable sort of a person and i think those are the things that you need to have
2838172 a lot of these organisations i have something to do with have a close liaison with council
2838173 im very proud of our town and i think its an exciting time to be here

2838179 weve got to encourage it because i dont think people really think about it they just dont realise its there
2838180 its just so good and its fun it doesnt cost a lot of money and you keep your money in the area instead of going out to the coast
2838181 they dont know the area so i show them some really nice bush towns west of the great divide and there are so many beautiful places to go to
2838182 theres that many little places where you can buy a bit of lunch or morning tea
2838183 theres so many things to do i just love it
2838184 and i thought it probably cost us 100 for fuel thats all 200 to 300 in total
2838185 while the decision to impose a 20 per cent reduction of water usage based on the 2005 06 year was essential during level 5 emergency restriction in 2007 it has become apparent that this is not practical for some operations
2838186 a site specific target based on industry best practice is likely to prove a more sustainable option for each site
2838187 theres been a bit of a void in the industrial area of smaller type spaces but in a good location
2838188 just drive through taminda anyone thats in there could be a candidate for it
2838189 these are in a really prime location in barnes st it offers flexibility of someone taking a small space or they can combine two spaces with parking as well
2838190 now that its getting to that point theres more interest coming in they can see whats there
2838191 its another good example where a dormant corner has become alive again because the old milk factory was standing there vacant for so long doing nothing
2838192 in the last seven to 10 years we had a number of untidy corners their use had lapsed they were looking tired and run down in tamworth

2838203 there is no escape from wood smoke pollution particularly in older wooden houses during winter temperature inversions in christchurch or anywhere else

2838235 for us to advance to the finals we simply need people to vote for our business plan now through september to put us in the top 5

2838241 obviously for those families who would benefit its very welcome news but it doesnt go far enough we are looking at energy bills on average going up 400 since the beginning of the year
2838242 i think the government has this idea it will do a bit here and a bit there without really addressing the problem what they really need to do is think quite fundamentally about some of these issues and how best to make sure people can afford the energy they need
2838243 energy like food and shelter is a basic necessity as a civilised society we must make sure that everybody can afford the basic necessities
2838244 this is blatant indiscriminate electioneering in one of the final winters before the general election
2838245 the protection of those least able to heat their homes is a priority for the government we will continue to work with energy companies amongst others on measures to help the most vulnerable to reduce the amount of energy they use and to lower their bills
2838246 with high fuel prices the coming winter will be difficult for many families and we are committed to supporting them the government is continuing to consider the best ways of meeting this challenge
2838247 as helpless in the grip of his sex drive as of his political ambitions
2838248 i would have thought if they really wanted to get away from it they wouldnt be reading history or biographies i think they would gain as much from reading imaginative fiction or historical fiction
2838249 if it materialises we would perhaps come back and live nearby
2838250 you can change anything you want but just dont touch the rates
2838251 i would immediately signal a long term desire to replace the council tax
2838252 while people are paying so much of their monthly income in council tax in comparison to their mortgage or income tax they feel as though the system is not working for them thats largely a product of the way the tax has developed over the years the way that revaluations have not taken place
2838253 i believe in a property tax but we should be open to other ideas including elements of land value tax too if they are found to be workable
2838254 these are difficult and complex issues and we must spend the time as a party to get this right
2838255 she believes there needs to be a property based tax but there is still a lot of work needing to be done
2838256 the time has come for a partnership of equals between party and government north and south of the border a more autonomous scottish labour party with real political freedom within a radically reformed union with a new relationship to uk labour makes sense in 2008
2838257 develop new constitutional futures for scotland without having to defer to westminster
2838258 an autonomous labour party in scotland or something approaching that could be better placed to offer an alternative to independence as a vision for the future as well as providing effective opposition and advocacy on the policy front
2838259 the relationship between scottish labour and the uk westminster party needs to be reviewed and rewritten to reflect the new realities
2838260 labour are fighting like ferrets in a sack on whether or not the party in scotland should be autonomous and whether or not they support a referendum on scottish independence

2838282 its being used in a political way to further a political cause and that was never the purpose of the grand jury system in kansas
2838283 this is a measure for the people to get some justice if law enforcement doesnt do its job and thats exactly what were doing
2838284 using the grand jury i believe as a tool to harass
2838285 this is an important check and to the extent that its used for political purposes as part of some sort of broader agenda it threatens the viability of the check itself
2838286 should satisfy itself that the grand jury has not engaged in an arbitrary fishing expedition and that the targets were not selected and subpoenas issued out of malice or with intent to harass
2838287 it is the feeling of this grand jury that the current statute that addresses the formation of a grand jury be evaluated as to evidence required to call the grand jury
2838288 the grand jury also feels that the statute also be re evaluated as to the percentage of the population required to convene a grand jury
2838289 he cant leave one place without calling and letting me know where hes going
2838290 its a great way to keep tabs on the kids without making them feel youre breathing down their necks
2838291 best temporary measure to extricate the country from its worst situation
2838292 with the quickness a little tale of young black love hardcore style
2838293 adjusting and constantly evolving expanding and trying to stay as young as i can
2838294 could use a little more substance like we had in the day
2838295 theyre standing on our shoulders some of them dont realize it because they sample me so much
2838296 i started to walk out i thought it was a disney thing i had never heard of this thing
2838297 toward the opening i started having trepidations oh my god what have i done ive ruined my career but when it aired the ratings went through the roof
2838298 with the quickness a little tale of young black love hardcore style
2838299 i am sick of republicans pronouncing barack obamas name like it was some sort of cuss word
2838300 my name is such a vanilla white girl american name
2838301 its one of those things that just takes off because everybody got it right away
2838302 people would not listen to what you were saying on the phone or on their doorstep because they thought he was muslim
2838303 he actually thought i was going to convert to islam
2838304 messed up is not the phrase i think you know the phrase
2838305 i fully support giving our troops the funding they need and am concerned about the plight of iraqi refugees
2838306 but we cannot neglect the most pressing emergency here at home along the gulf coast
2838307 in this bill and others the blue dogs and i are pushing for our priorities to be paid for instead of borrowing the money from china that will have to be paid back with interest by our children and grandchildren
2838308 when the katrina disaster happened we couldnt help but notice here was forced displacement in the richest country in the world
2838309 you just dont want to be in a situation where its either money for people who are disabled and really hurting in new orleans as opposed to money for people who are dislocated because of the war in iraq
2838310 our view at the risk of sounding naive is that money would be available for both
2838311 im pleading with them not to negotiate with the lives of 3 000 of our most vulnerable citizens
2838312 people have been languishing in new orleans for two and a half years
2838313 how many times have i wished i were a man when sheikh ayman al zawahri said there are no women in al qaida he saddened and hurt me
2838314 i felt that my heart was about to explode in my chest i am powerless
2838315 women were very disappointed because what al zawahri said is not whats happening today in the middle east especially in iraq or in palestinian groups
2838316 suicide operations are being carried out by women who play an important role in jihad
2838317 a lot of the girls i speak to want to carry weapons they live with this great frustration and oppression
2838318 we dont have a special militant wing for women but that doesnt mean that we strip women of the right to go to jihad
2838319 be ready for any service the mujahedeen need from her
2838320 i say to you i have tasted the bitterness of american brutality my favorite wifes chest was crushed by a concrete ceiling
2838321 i use my pen and words my honest emotions jihad is not exclusive to men
2838322 the internet gives them the ideal place to write their ideas while theyre hidden far from the world
2838323 does our sheik mean that there is no need to use women in our current jihad why can we not use them
2838324 we will stand covered by our veils and wrapped in our robes weapons in hand our children in our laps with the quran and the sunna sayings of the prophet of allah directing and guiding us
2838325 from tomorrow there will be a great meeting of our peoples to continue to deepen the process of change
2838326 you can really feel the change the right wing governors wont let him govern
2838327 the government is a satellite of hugo chavez and wants to impose a constitution that centralises destroys institutions and the economy
2838328 this government has not learnt how to govern and for that reason i ask the armed forces to overthrow the president
2838329 theyll remain deadlocked and each side will use it to become more deeply entrenched in their positions
2838330 with the quickness a little tale of young black love hardcore style
2838331 hes lived peacefully among us for years and he should be able to live out the twilight of his life with us
2838332 this is a nice family we really treasure this family
2838333 this is clearly a reflection of the political atmosphere which exists in austria and which in certain circles is extremely sympathetic to suspected nazi war criminals
2838334 has never showed any remorse for actions which affected the fates of hundreds of people
2838335 i am ready to come to face the court in croatia but im not in the best health
2838336 we suspected from the very beginning that he might have been faking it making a specific effort to appear as unfit as possible
2838337 and in no way are protecting a suspected nazi war criminal
2838338 austria is a constitutional state not guantanamo we dont toss our principles overboard for political gain
2838339 i think that austria is quite advanced in a number of areas where other countries are still struggling
2838340 i really cant think of a worse way to remember the holocaust than to not arrest a leading nazi war crimes suspect
2838341 in much of the developed world one uses racial epithets at ones legal peril one displays nazi regalia and the other trappings of ethnic hatred at significant legal risk and one urges discrimination against religious minorities under threat of fine or imprisonment
2838342 it is not clear to me that the europeans are mistaken
2838343 when they say that a liberal democracy must take affirmative responsibility for protecting the atmosphere of mutual respect against certain forms of vicious attack
2838344 freedom for the thought that we hate a biography of the first amendment
2838345 in an age when words have inspired acts of mass murder and terrorism
2838346 i think we should be able to punish speech that urges terrorist violence to an audience some of whose members are ready to act on the urging
2838347 there seems to be a tendency to say there is too much freedom
2838348 the world didnt suffer because too many people read mein kampf
2838349 sending hitler on a speaking tour of the united states would have been quite a good idea
2838350 the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market
2838351 against attempts to check the expression of opinions that we loathe and believe to be fraught with death
2838352 you are the only thing between racist hateful contemptuous islamophobic and irresponsible journalism and law abiding canadian citizens
2838353 nor is truth nor is fair comment on true facts publication in the public interest and for the public benefit is not a defense opinion expressed in good faith is not a defense responsible journalism is not a defense
2838354 canadians do not have a cast iron stomach for offensive speech
2838355 we dont subscribe to a marketplace of ideas americans as a whole are more tough minded and more prepared for verbal combat
2838356 unlawfully promoting hatred against an identifiable group by communicating anti semitic statements
2838357 crucial to the disposition of this appeal the relationship between canadian and american approaches to the constitutional protection of free expression most notably in the realm of hate propaganda
2838358 there is much to be learned from first amendment jurisprudence
2838359 the international commitment to eradicate hate propaganda and most importantly the special role given equality and multiculturalism in the canadian constitution necessitate a departure from the view reasonably prevalent in america at present that the suppression of hate propaganda is incompatible with the guarantee of free expression
2838360 it would be really hard to criticize israel austria germany and south africa given their histories
2838361 in canada the right to freedom of expression is not absolute nor should it be
2838362 by portraying muslims as all sharing the same negative characteristics including being a threat to the west this explicit expression of islamophobia further perpetuates and promotes prejudice toward muslims and others
2838363 the problem with so called hate speech laws is that theyre not about facts
2838364 what were learning here is really the bedrock difference between the united states and the countries that are in a broad sense its legal cousins
2838365 western governments are becoming increasingly comfortable with the regulation of opinion the first amendment really does distinguish the u s not just from canada but from the rest of the western world
2838366 it was an advantage to be more anxious in a dangerous environment
2838367 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety
2838368 still to identify the first candidates for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
2838369 midwives pay is not keeping pace with prices staff numbers are not keeping pace with the birthrate and investment is not keeping pace with the demands on the service
2838370 the current system is not working bail is too easily granted frequently breached and improperly enforced public confidence is undermined when bail conditions are routinely breached offenders hold the criminal justice system in contempt and new victims of crime are created unnecessarily it is time to tighten the bail laws and put public safety first
2838371 lack of diligence in verifying suggested bail conditions scant evidence of enforcement of those conditions and a failure to deal effectively with breaches when they occurred
2838372 i never thought of it as a photo of a smoking kid
2838373 it was just of a kid in romania and how his life is you can never make a serious documentary if you always have to think about what flickr will delete
2838374 we often get caught in the middle between a rock and a hard place
2838375 were obviously sensitive to the freedoms we have particularly in this country to speak our mind yet we want to be good corporate citizens and make the internet a better and safer place
2838376 sole discretion to pre screen refuse or remove any content
2838377 were pretty transparent when we make mistakes we have a record of being good about stepping up and fessing up
2838378 as we move more of our communications into social networks how are we limiting ourselves if we cant see alternative points of view if we cant see the things that offend us
2838379 vagueness does not inspire the confidence of people and leaves room for gaming the system by outside groups
2838380 when the rules are clear and the grievance procedures are clear then people know what they are working with and they at least have a starting point in urging changes in those rules
2838381 going after individuals can be difficult they can be hard to find they can be hard to sue
2838382 intermediaries still have a calculus where if a particular web site is causing a lot of trouble it may not be worth it to them
2838383 dont have the critical mass no one would see it
2838384 people know that myspace is the biggest site that contains music
2838385 what counts as name calling what counts as making fun of someone in a way thats good natured
2838386 there are sites that do employ teams of people that do that investigation but we feel thats a job we wouldnt do well
2838387 if youre knocked off one of those in a lot of ways you dont exist
2838388 if loving you is wrong i dont want to be right
2838389 if you really want to know about the mind the spirit and life itself read scientology the fundamentals of thought it will put you on the right path
2838390 let me tell you something wax enthusiastic and youll feel so a being causes his own feelings its the joy of creating uh
2838391 what did you think about when matt and trey did that episode on scientology
2838392 one thing about matt and trey they lampoon everybody and if you take that serious ill sell you the brooklyn bridge for two dollars thats what they do
2838393 guys you have it all wrong were not like that i know thats your thing but get your information correct because somebody might believe that shit you know
2838394 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
2838395 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians muslims mormons or jews
2838396 we never heard a peep out of isaac in any way until we did scientology he wants a different standard for religions other than his own and to me that is where intolerance and bigotry begin
2838397 isaac hayes did not quit south park my sources say that someone quit it for him friends in memphis tell me that hayes did not issue any statements on his own about south park they are mystified
2838398 remember chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song
2838399 be mad at that fruity little club for scrambling his brains
2838400 the forecast for gdp will in all likelihood be revised lower perhaps even to show a recession in the second half of this year at the same time we expect an upward revision to the cpi inflation forecast for 2008 the peak will probably be in the region of 5 5 per cent the bank is unlikely to endorse market expectations of rate cuts over the next 12 months
2838401 no doubt that the mood has darkened in the last two or three months
2838402 a year ago it seemed reasonable to hope that the worst would be over by now that has not turned out to be the case
2838403 most analysts are now suggesting that the economy will at best only manage to stagnate in the coming few quarters and that the growth prospects through 2009 and into 2010 look no better than anaemic
2838404 we have had about 120 calls regarding flooding in fife people have called from all over the county it has not been confined to one part of the county
2838405 there have been no major evacuations or anything like that but a lot of peoples homes have been flooded
2838406 it has just been excessive rain across the county local burns bursting their banks and things like that
2838407 the amount of rain we have had has been unbelievable and thats been the main focus
2838408 fortunately no one has been injured in any of the incidents
2838409 we saw several bands of heavy rain moving across fife throughout the evening and into the night
2838410 these were the result of a developing low pressure moving across from ireland and southern scotland within this there was a fair amount of warm moist air so there was a lot of moisture available so the rain was very heavy
2838411 there has been a lot of wet weather over the past few weeks and the ground was saturated so there were problems with flooding
2838412 the destruction flooding can cause is traumatic in terms of loss of property and devastating for the people and businesses directly affected
2838413 the scottish government is in touch with the relevant local agencies in fife and will continue to monitor the situation closely today and overnight
2838414 can i do my wekniz uncle scotty i wanna see dodo
2838415 can i see dodo i wanna do dodo there she is move your hands uncle scotty move your hands
2838416 no uncle scotty let me do it im gonna do it

2838421 cmon sweetie lets go find bubba its time to take a nap
2838422 noooooooooooooooooooooooooo i need to find alyssa noooooooooo i dont want to find bubba i dont want to take a nap
2838423 we need to be on stage we need to show our country we need to dance for our country we want to show who we are what we do and that art is something else we can talk about
2838424 the russian people and russian politicians are two different things
2838425 if we want to have a stable situation there why just russians lets bring somebody else from ukraine or europe to stay there and control the situation
2838426 if we are wrong have somebody else there to exit russians and control the situation
2838427 you cannot call it the stupid georgians doing something because its our territory we dont do one step out its inside our territory
2838428 the situation feels like russia wants again to occupy our territory everybody in the world says this is georgian territory and they just want to control of it we are ready to do anything to finish this one we want to just control our small territory that we have
2838429 the georgian tanks fired at everything they saw including women and children
2838430 today stopped firing in the south ossetian conflict zone and is ready to begin talks with russia on a ceasefire and cessation of hostilities
2838431 peacekeepers posts monitor the presence of georgian forces artillery and armour
2838432 lets state clearly that we are ready to put an end to the war that we will withdraw from south ossetia that we will sign an agreement on non use of force
2838433 sadly there have been recent foreign office cuts to vital peace and reconciliation efforts in the region
2838434 it is essential that humanitarian agencies be able to reach the affected and the displaced and that those trapped in conflict areas be granted passage to safer areas as soon as possible
2838435 buyers are buying but they are being more cautious theres more discipline and no sort of irrationality out there when it comes to buying people are more prepared to miss out
2838436 for a city the size of hamilton even in these conditions youd expect that to be closer to 280 that shows that there are parts of the city where stocks are low and people are just holding on to their homes
2838437 we are really lacking a lot of nice quality homes there are a lot of stale properties on the market that have been there for some time
2838438 there isnt that level of frenzied activity that there was last year where people were buying because they feared theyd miss out if the prices kept on going up
2838439 we used to see people look at a house that ticked five boxes and theyd buy it now people are happy to pass a house over if its not right
2838440 at this stage expectations and the general feeling is that sale prices are likely to fall a little more before levelling out as we enter the spring months
2838441 a jesuit friend and i have been struck by the similarity of the aa twelve steps and the spiritual exercises of st ignatius
2838442 the curious little man went on and on and as he did bill could feel his body relaxing his spirits rising gradually he realized that this man sitting across from him was radiating a kind of grace primarily father ed wanted to talk about the paradox of aa the regeneration he called it the strength arising out of defeat and weakness the loss of ones old life as a condition for achieving a new one and bill agreed with everything
2838443 bill had made a decision father ed reminded him to turn his life and his will over to god he was not to sit in judgment on how he or the world was proceeding he had only to keep the channels open it was not up to him to decide how fast or how slowly aa developed for whether the two of them liked it or not the world was undoubtedly proceeding as it should in gods good time
2838444 very free use of the ignatian rules for the discernment of spirits for the second week of the spiritual exercise
2838445 father ed an early and wonderful friend of aa died as this last message went to press he was the greatest and most gentle soul to walk this planet i was closer to him than to any other human being on earth
2838446 moving therapy from the expensive clinical couch to the low cost coffee bar from the inexperienced professional to the informed amateur aa has democratized sanity
2838447 my own life story gathered for years around an implacable pursuit of money fame and power anti climaxed by my near sinking in a sea of alcohol though i survived that grim misadventure i well understand that the dread neurotic germ of the power contagion has survived in me also it is only dormant and it can again multiply and rend me and aa too tens of thousands of aa members are temperamentally like me they know it fortunately and i know it hence our tradition of anonymity and hence my clear obligation to decline this honor with all the immediate satisfaction and benefit it could have yielded

2838459 a lot of film makers just dont know how to scare people anymore theres not that many genuinely scary films anymore
2838460 there was once a formula for scary films but it was deconstructed in the scary movie series as a way to reinvigorate the genre then people went to torture porn theyre not scary but theyre about how much gore an audience can take
2838461 it was an advantage to be more anxious in a dangerous environment

2838476 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2838477 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2838478 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2838479 he escaped on my watch as sheriff and the day he is captured ill be on the first plane out to personally bring him home i look forward to that day
2838480 but theres not much a martial artist is gonna do against a 45 caliber pistol
2838481 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2838482 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2838483 hey cool ive been there and not just seen it on tv
2838484 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
2838485 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
2838486 according to israeli sources former israeli brigadier general gal hirsch gave the georgian army advice on the establishment of elite units such as sayeret matkal and on rearmament and gave various courses in the fields of combat intelligence and fighting in built up areas
2838487 israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
2838488 we are now in a fight against the great russia
2838489 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own
2838490 its important that the entire world understands that what is happening in georgia now will affect the entire world order its not just georgias business but the entire worlds business
2838491 was an atmosphere of war about to break out we received basic background about tensions between georgia and russia but most of what i learned came from talking to the soldiers from my point of view the battles of the past few days were to be expected
2838492 its not the standard we know in israel but when we left them they were at a good level they took the training very seriously there is a wider age range than in israel from 18 to 35 but they function very well over the past few days ive been following the news and i think they grasped a little of how to use strategy like we taught them it looks like we did a good job
2838493 we taught them counterterror and house to house fighting but that was very basic
2838494 is furious over the foreign ministry directive to freeze israeli weapons sales to georgia when we found ourselves in a similar situation we expected the world to act differently he said
2838495 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2838496 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2838497 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2838498 im broken in my heart because the guys at haas racing were doing an awesome job strategy was perfect and we were ready to attack for the last nine laps
2838499 it was crazy i came out of the last corner someone pushed me in the back the next thing i saw was kind of a black car in the middle of the track smashed from the back to the side then my car was destroyed
2838500 i banged the steering wheel so hard i think i bent it from how upset i was we put the haas car in a position to finish for sure strong we had the right strategy we had the right fuel we were attacking i had jeff gordon right in front on me we were catching him it was a dream coming true and unfortunately we ended up in the wall but we will be back

2838529 a maior prioridade dos formuladores de pol ticas afastar a press o inflacion ria ascendente enquanto mant m em vista os riscos para o crescimento
2838530 a economia global est em um lugar dif cil apanhada entre a demanda em franca desacelera o em muitas economias avan adas e o aumento da infla o em outras notadamente nas economias emergentes e em desenvolvimento
2838531 nos pa ses emergentes e em desenvolvimento as press es inflacion rias est o crescendo mais rapidamente
2838532 the strong result for the year was driven by good sales and margin growth in pipelines and tradelink
2838533 i was pretty confident that in the end i was probably going to have to make a move with brandon
2838534 doing it at this time is partly because he has been a loyal 49er for the last six years this gives him an opportunity to get with another squad he wasnt getting as many reps as i know hed like to have
2838535 he should win the high times stoner of the year award hands down ive been the recipient of that by the way not to brag
2838536 jason mewes jay eventually cleaned up so in keeping his character and silent bob played by smith also were off the weed by the time of
2838537 i thought i was going to die the house shifted the front door its a solid wooden door its in pieces
2838538 when these letters first started coming my daughter and i both lived in a constant state of anxiety and fear
2838539 i felt as if they were trying to take advantage of me and extort money from me without any justification i knew i had to fight back
2838540 this scheme has been challenged by consumers across the country but has not been stopped either because the wrong legal theory was used and or the case was settled
2838541 this lawsuit seeks to stop this practice once and for all
2838542 these retailers some or many of them by policy encourage people to be stopped wrongfully
2838543 some employees are given incentives to detain as many people as possible
2838544 when we learned about how millions of customers were treated in the same manner by this firm and that there is an actual industry out there that makes millions of dollars by basically these one page letters without any personal review by a lawyer
2838545 depending on the dollar value of the merchandise some retailers have certain types of criteria on whether or not they are going to call the police
2838546 when an individual takes possession of the merchandise with the intention to deprive the retailer of the benefit of use or full retail value of the property they have crossed a property rights line
2838547 none of the property crimes people worry about such as convenience store theft bank robberies and household burglary even come close to these numbers
2838548 compounding the problem is that we all pay for this loss in terms of higher prices
2838549 these generic form letters are meant to harass intimidate and coerce consumers into paying a large fine by threatening civil action
2838550 its pretty serious when you get a threatening letter from a law firm
2838551 the amount that they charge varies and can be based on hourly rates and monthly retainers depending on how much time and work is done in any given month
2838552 defendant and its co conspirators on its own and as part of a common fraudulent scheme and conspiracy extorted millions of dollars from consumers
2838553 there is no requirement under the law for tort claims that demand letters be followed by lawsuits
2838554 courts generally favor out of court settlements and sometimes retailers choose not to proceed with suits if these matters are not amicably resolved through the demand process
2838555 what we are doing is proper and we are protecting the rights of retailers
2838556 in a tough economy retailers need to watch their bottom line and while they are trying to stay afloat the last thing they need is people taking merchandise
2838557 i have been training a lot with my brother to achieve this win
2838558 the main rules have not changed since the beginning of the competition ten years ago
2838559 we have six men or women sitting inside the sauna on each round and the winner is the last one to leave
2838560 there are no world records we cannot control all the factors like the temperature of the sauna or the water thrown into the stove
2838561 i opened this store about a year ago business has been ok now i dont know how im going to afford to fix it up
2838562 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2838563 if it materialises we would perhaps come back and live nearby
2838564 we were running out of fuel we either had to do it then or not for an hour because we would have had to refuel and come back
2838565 he was around 700 metres from the compound when they came in
2838566 the only way to stop them escaping is to encircle them immediately
2838567 you dont know whether the people in there are going to fight against you or try and escape
2838568 if you land on every side you land light and you risk a blue on blue friendly fire incident
2838569 its frustrating more than anything the blokes were all psyched up but they ran away when they heard us coming

2838576 a partir del jueves vamos a discutir otros temas que quedaron pendientes
2838577 la noticia que importa ahora para la comunidad es que a partir de este lunes las clases se van a dictar sin ning n inconveniente
2838578 se han perdido much simos d as de clases innecesariamente porque terminamos acordando lo mismo del 28 de julio en cuanto al monto que el ejecutivo estaba dispuesto a invertir para incrementar los salarios docentes
2838579 pero bueno lo bueno es que se pudo llevar a un acuerdo y tranquilizar a la comunidad para a partir de ahora llevar adelante el debate de otros temas que tambi n tienen que ver con los docentes y con la relaci n laboral sin tanto nivel de conflictividad
2838580 parte de lo que se acord hoy consiste en que no habr m s inconvenientes hasta el 31 de diciembre

2838588 the town and many nearby villages are too dangerous people are sleeping in the open
2838589 there are also many wounded in the villages they need help no one knows how many are dead
2838590 what is happening is not because of the separatist regions which have been a headache for georgia for over a decade now but because of democracy in georgia
2838591 russia hates democracy its always been an authoritarian state and always will be this russian aggression is a fight against democracy and the world must defend democracy
2838592 russia has always wanted to see georgia on its knees but it will never achieve that
2838593 i hope that russia will retreat i hope it will break its neck here in the caucasus
2838594 lets stand together against russian aggression and occupation and cheer our troops
2838595 weve been hearing all these years that weve got strong and powerful friends across the ocean but it turned out these stories were just a bluff
2838596 we may be stupid we may have made mistakes but will the us and europe really let russia get away with attacking another country
2838597 its five miles if you go the direct route but we didnt
2838598 we went the long way and took in a few hills
2838599 and she used to cycle along the coast road thats where she learned her sprinting she told me when she was 11 she was going to be an olympic champion
2838600 we dont have the heat theyve got in china but we do certainly have the rain and the wind i think that stood her in good stead
2838601 politicians should straighten out the situation today and if they dont well have to get involved we live in the 21st century after all we shouldnt really stoop so low to wage wars against each other
2838602 i think the blue skies will come ive got my fingers crossed
2838603 this has been one of the failures of the bush administration failing to build a strong relationship a mutually beneficial relationship with russia so wed have the kind of influence to persuade them to stop some of these very very dangerous efforts within their territory
2838604 this is a great start to the beijing olympics for team gb
2838605 and i have no doubt this medal will fire up the rest of the team to do their best in the next two weeks well done to nicole cooke she has set us on our way
2838606 we talked last week about them coming out here but they stayed at home
2838607 when i called them just after the race it sounded as though they had the whole village there
2838608 they said do whatever you want to do but make sure you do your best
2838609 i want to win races and know that ive won them because i was the strongest and because of my hard work if i was faced with a serious question about whether to take drugs i would leave the sport
2838610 we were being treated as proper racing cyclists there were jerseys flowers and commentators i came home and said ok this is what i think i really want to do
2838611 la rinascita dellantico nellarte italiana da federico ii ad andrea pisano exempla
2838612 is the goal of the russian federation to change the leadership of georgia
2838613 there are leaders who become an obstacle sometimes those leaders need to contemplate how useful they have become to their people
2838614 i came in the boot of a car georgian snipers were firing at us from the forest my brother stayed to fight our grandparents home was reduced to rubble we dont know where they are nothing is left of their village it was totally destroyed by rockets and tank fire
2838615 the town and many nearby villages are too dangerous there are many wounded no one knows how many are dead
2838616 we have decided to redeploy our troops to get a chance to resist a superior russian armed force with other methods
2838617 bush understands that its not really about georgia but in a certain sense its also an aggression against america the russians want the whole of georgia the russians need control over energy routes from central asia and the caspian sea in addition they want to get rid of us they want regime change every democratic movement in this neighbouring region must be got rid of
2838618 i do not believe this will have an impact on the olympic games
2838619 we advocate the principle of non violence and the promotion of freedom democracy and human rights through peaceful means we also sincerely hope for a peaceful olympic games
2838620 you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion

2838627 va sottolineata la differenza di ritmo che si instaura tra i versi che pure sono uguali novenari in ogni strofe i primi due novenari hanno un ritmo incalzante concitato ascendente con quellimpennata prodotta soprattutto dallaccento sulla seconda sillaba e poi sulla quinta e sullottava
2838628 nella movenza impennata dei primi due versi il pascoli ha rinvenuto il grafico limmediata significazione musicale dellaggressivit con cui la natura e la notte stringono lassedio dei loro inviti damore negli ultimi due con quel gorgo lento che la sosta centrale produce ha trasfuso un crollare smemorato e blando

2838630 e qui il segreto di questa poesia che si detto valere s per se stessa ma che ben pi ci stupisce e incanta nella rivelazione di un mirabile sfumato purissimo simbolo nel segreto di un miracolo notturno di un altro gelsomino che si apre e che come lerba silenziosa sopra le fosse va segretamente dal mistero del nulla verso la vita in quel dolce silenzio in quellombra profumata quasi dalla passione del fiore quando anche quellultimo lume spento ha cominciato a germinare una nuova vita che come dentro lurna segreta del fiore notturno su cui a mattina si chiudono i petali un poco gualciti prepara una felicit nuova la maternit e la novella vita

2838633 polizia municipale qui le entrate assammano spiega il presidente dellunione dei comuni del rubicone tiziano gasperoni a circa 2 milioni di euro mentre la spesa ha taccato quota un miliane e 798 mila euro prati camente un pareggio va precisato inoltre aggiunge il presidente che buona parte della spesa riguarda gli oneri per il persanale quantificabili per il 2008 intorno ad un milione di euro sicuramente da rive dere al rialzo visto che sono previste dieci nuove assunzioni con le farmule part time e tempo indeter minato direi che si tratta di un incremento necessa rio per un pi attenta e capillare cantrallo del ter ritorio servizio questul tima pi valte oggetta in passato di perplessit e critiche comunque molto si sta facendo a partire dalla sistemazione logistica presso la nuova caserma dellunione a savignano

2838635 personale qui la spesa si attesta al momento sui 320 mila euro soldi che girano come si dice con qualche piccola ma significativa economia dai comuni alle casse dellunione
2838636 con questo bilancio si chiude anche il percorso di costituzione del lunione quattro importanti servizi sono da considerare oggi e dopo avere superato numerose difficolt sotto la gestione del nuovo ente sovra comu nale possiamo cos affermare che da questa data lunione dei comuni del rubicone ha raggiunto una sua fisiono mia una sua struttura zione dalla quale attingere le iniziative future vorrei anche aggiungere che lunione oltre a risul tare una realt politica e amministrativa ormai con gambe proprie anche una presenza importante sul piano economico potr quindi risultare un prezioso elemento di traino per lintera area del rubicone

2838665 these life and death judgments are made behind closed doors by secretive priorities panels dominated by nhs managers

2838669 its completely surreal and we are really uneasy we dont dare any more to propose any price below 100 million for these clients anything below and they throw you out and you should see how they do it

2838671 i attended a party where the guests had fun throwing burning 500 notes into the air while everyone split their sides laughing the domestic staff were later told to collect the ashes it was sickening
2838672 two hundred people are completely destabilising it these russian oligarchs have thrown themselves into a bidding war like onassis and niarchos
2838673 what they want is to make sure theres enough water for the future that they have a safe reliable supply and the sewage system works
2838674 what they are saying strongly is that they dont want prices going up by more than inflation they are sensitive about prices because of everything else that is going up
2838675 we are looking at ways of dealing with the issue no decisions have yet been taken
2838676 britain faces yet more confusion on the back of this new speculation about the governments plans if gordon brown had acted prudently and put money aside for a rainy day during the good years as all our competitors did he wouldnt be floundering now floating all sorts of ideas that he doesnt know how to pay for clearly the government has learnt nothing from the damage done by speculation on stamp duty changes
2838677 the current system is not working bail is too easily granted frequently breached and improperly enforced
2838678 public confidence is undermined when bail conditions are routinely breached offenders hold the criminal justice system in contempt and new victims of crime are created unnecessarily it is time to tighten the bail laws and put public safety first
2838679 is the goal of the russian federation to change the leadership of georgia
2838680 there are leaders who become an obstacle sometimes those leaders need to contemplate how useful they have become to their people

2838685 young people are missing out they are doing better than ever in science tests at 14 but hardly any are going on to study triple science at gcse despite the opportunities and learning it offers
2838686 it is essential that all our children have the chance of the best possible science education if they are to enjoy the employment opportunities of the future

2838688 we advocate the principle of non violence and the promotion of freedom democracy and human rights through peaceful means we also sincerely hope for a peaceful olympic games
2838689 you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2838690 this is one of the most important things in our portfolio because if we are serious in cutting down on co2 emissions we need to exhaust our possibilities on how we can develop wind and photovoltaic but if we are serious about cutting emissions we have no other choice but to use nuclear
2838691 its pity to see that edf as a world player isnt taking this opportunity but this is not the end of the nuclear development its just the start
2838692 we have a number of tasks how we take care of the waste bring the whole site to how it was before how are we able to develop skills and talents in west cumbria and in the uk to take this success story and multiple it and implement it somewhere else in the world
2838693 the message has to be that as we want to develop nuclear skills we have a 40 year plan that engineering in nuclear is going to be wanted for the next 40 years graduates at present are getting a degree in nuclear decommissioning not nuclear development we need to have a second line in parallel to decommissioning to take us to the second level it may take us a decade or so it is not a matter of a couple of years
2838694 there has been at least a very clear message that the government is supporting the plans for nuclear this is a very important step and we shouldnt underestimate the importance of the commitment of a country to a plan
2838695 god did not give everyone oil and gas many countries would like to be sitting on some kind of resources but that isnt the case thats why you have unions and agreements but these things are very dynamic very fluid who would have thought that angola would be interesting for the us suddenly angola is supplying the us with oil which they didnt have before

2838697 and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read
2838698 and paul as his manner was went in unto them and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures
2838699 paul and his company went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and sat down
2838700 and on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side where prayer was wont to be made and we sat down and spake unto the women which resorted thither
2838701 and he paul reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded the jews and the greeks
2838702 blessed is the man that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it
2838703 also the sons of the stranger that join themselves to the lord every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it and taketh hold of my covenant even them will i bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people
2838704 and when the jews were gone out of the synagogue the gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath
2838705 and the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of god
2838706 and he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded the jews and the greeks
2838707 ye shall not add unto the word which i command you neither shall ye diminish aught from it that ye may keep the commandments of the lord your god
2838708 every word of god is pure add thou not unto his words lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liar
2838709 till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven
2838710 i like it too it shows youre a sensitive person j i bet you line the ladies up with that one

2838712 hey im a musician too want me to sing a song for you
2838713 if stella knew it was going to be used by hockley there is no way she would have lent it
2838714 it was loaned to a stylist in good faith but when stella saw the picture she was furious stella is disgusted
2838715 hockley is aware of stella mccartneys views and is respectful of them this was an unfortunate mistake and hockley would not intentionally make anyone feel uncomfortable
2838716 some situations take courageous decisions with regard to the political future
2838717 sometimes there are democratically elected or semi democratically elected leaders who do things which create grave problems for their countries
2838718 so sometimes those leaders should contemplate how useful they have become to their people
2838719 for me it confirms that what the russian federation is seeking through this military aggression and invasion is to change the democratically elected georgian government

2838764 no person of color is safe from this treatment anywhere regardless of their obedience to the law skin color has become evidence of the propensity to commit crime and police use this evidence against minority drivers
2838765 police use traffic stops as a pretext in order to fish for evidence both anecdotal and quantitative data show that nationwide the police exercise this discretionary power primarily against african americans and latinos
2838766 fighting crime is surely a high priority but it must be done without damaging other important values the freedom to go about our business without unwarranted police interference and the right to be treated equally before the law without regard to race or ethnicity and unless we address this problem all of us not just people of color stand to lose

2838835 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
2838836 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed

2838838 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honoured to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
2838839 my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man

2838848 although we would like to be on our own campus it is a great experience living on the iit delhi campus too
2838849 my class has students from both iit kharagpur and iit bhubaneswar there is no way of telling the two sets apart except through their roll numbers
2838850 it is crucial to create an atmosphere where there is no scope of distinguishing between the two groups after all why do people come to iit they come for the iit experience while they are here we want to give the students of the new iit that experience
2838851 we are absolutely ready to welcome the iit rajasthan students and help them settle in our preparations are on track

2838899 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2838900 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2838901 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2838902 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2838903 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2838904 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2838905 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2838906 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2838907 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2838908 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2838909 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2838910 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2838911 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2838912 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2838913 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2838914 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2838915 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2838916 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2838917 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2838918 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2838919 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2838920 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2838921 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2838922 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2838923 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2838924 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2838925 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2838926 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2838927 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2838928 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2838929 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2838930 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2838931 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2838932 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2838933 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2838934 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2838935 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2838936 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2838937 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2838938 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2838939 in july 1975 two manned spacecraft were launched into earth orbit one from kazakhstan the other from florida their rendezvous in orbit fulfilled a 1972 agreement between the soviet union and the united states to participate in a joint venture in space

2838942 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2838943 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2838944 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2838945 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2838946 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2838947 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2838948 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2838949 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2838950 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2838951 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2838952 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2838953 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2838954 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2838955 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2838956 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2838957 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2838958 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2838959 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2838960 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2838961 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2838962 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

2838976 a large trend is being crystallized among the palestinian national authority pna in ramallah to call for settling the situation with the gaza strip by force
2838977 to give the last chance for the egyptian government and the arab league to convince hamas to immediately end its coup and engage in the dialogue
2838978 but the door for dialogue will not be open forever and the leadership only gave one month time for the efforts
2838979 will be a dangerous thing if it was officially made
2838980 it will boost the internal split and separate gaza from the west bank

2839015 come ye blessed of my father possess you the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for i was hungry and you gave me to eat i was thirsty and you gave me to drink i was a stranger and you took me in naked and you covered me sick and you visited me i was in prison and you came to me
2839016 and behold one came and said to him good master what good shall i do that i may have life everlasting
2839017 matt 19 16 21 are the above verses not filled with good works how much more proof from scripture do we need to show that our lord commanded us to do good works for our salvation
2839018 for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels and then will he render to every man according to his works
2839019 and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor
2839020 and if i should have prophecy and should know all mysteries and all knowledge and if i should have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing
2839021 and now there remain faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is charity
2839022 do you see that by works a man is justified and not by faith only
2839023 what shall it profit my brethren if a man say he hath faith but hath not works shall faith be able to save him
2839024 so faith also if it have not works is dead in itself
2839025 but some man will say thou hast faith and i have works shew me thy faith without works and i will shew thee by works my faith
2839026 but wilt thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead was not abraham our father justified by works offering up isaac his son upon the altar james 2 20 21
2839027 for even as the body without the spirit is dead so also faith without works is dead
2839028 wherefore brethren labor the more that by good works you may make sure your calling and election
2839029 abraham believed god and it was credited to him as righteousness
2839030 stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage
2839031 that i will break the assyrian in my land and upon my mountains tread him under foot then shall his yoke depart from off them and his burden depart from off their shoulders
2839032 christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage
2839033 christ is become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law ye are fallen from grace
2839034 come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
2839035 for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it
2839036 there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god for he that is entered into his rest he also hath ceased from his own works as god did from his

2839115 the hugely expensive antidrug campaigns we are waging around the world are basically futile
2839116 even as i write these words it is virtually certain that somewhere on the streets of washington d c an eighteen year old white kid from the maryland or north virginia suburbs is buying a stash of drugs from an eighteen year old black kid the white kid is going to take that stash back to the suburbs and make some quick money by selling it to other kids

2839138 from time to time lawyers and judges have tried to define what constitutes fairness like defining an elephant it is not easy to do although fairness in practice has the elephantine quality of being easy to recognise as a result of these efforts a word in common usage has acquired the trappings of legalism acting fairly has become acting in accordance with the rules of natural justice and on occasion has been dressed up with latin tags this phrase in my opinion serves no useful purpose and in recent years it has encouraged lawyers to try to put those who hold inquiries into legal straitjackets for the purposes of my judgment i intend to ask myself this simple question did the decision maker act fairly towards the plaintiff

2839161 sesungguhnya dari sebagian dari al bayan penjelasan itu terdapat sihir
2839162 as salafi adalah sebutan bagi siapa saja yang berada di atas manhaj salaf
2839163 kemudian jika kalian berlainan pendapat tentang sesuatu maka kembalikanlah ia kepada allah al quran dan rasul sunnahnya jika kalian benar benar beriman kepada allah dan hari kemudian yang demikian itu lebih utama bagi kalian dan lebih baik akibatnya
2839164 tunjukilah kami jalan yang lurus jalannya orang orang yang telah engkau beri nikmat
2839165 mereka adalah orang orang yang mengetahui kebenaran dan berusaha untuk mengikutinya maka setiap orang yang lebih mengetahui kebenaran serta lebih konsisten dalam mengikutinya tentu ia lebih berhak untuk berada di atas jalan yang lurus dan tidak diragukan lagi bahwa para sahabat rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam mereka adalah orang orang yang lebih berhak untuk menyandang sifat gelar ini daripada orang orang rafidhah
2839166 dan barangsiapa menentang rasul setelah jelas baginya kebenaran dan mengikuti selain jalannya orang orang mukmin kami biarkan ia leluasa bergelimang dalam kesesatan dan kami masukkan ia ke dalam jahannam dan jahannam itu seburuk buruk tempat kembali
2839167 para ulama telah menjelaskan tentang makna firman allah di atas sesungguhnya yang dimaksud dengan orang orang mukmin disini adalah para sahabat rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam dan generasi pertama dari umat ini karena mereka merupakan orang orang yang menyambut syariat ini dengan jiwa yang bersih
2839168 dan sungguh keduanya menentang rasul dan mengikuti selain jalannya orang orang mukmin red adalah saling terkait maka siapa saja yang menentang rasul sesudah jelas baginya kebenaran pasti ia telah mengikuti selain jalan orang orang mukmin dan siapa saja yang mengikuti selain jalan orang orang mukmin maka ia telah menentang rasul sesudah jelas baginya kebenaran
2839169 dan orang orang yang terdahulu lagi pertama tama masuk islam dari kalangan muhajirin dan anshar serta orang orang yang mengikuti mereka dengan baik allah ridha kepada mereka dan mereka pun ridha kepada allah dan allah menyediakan bagi mereka surga surga yang mengalir di dalamnya sungai sungai mereka kekal abadi di dalamnya itulah kesuksesan yang agung
2839170 allah subhanahu wa taala mengkhabarkan tentang keridhaan nya kepada orang orang yang terdahulu dari kalangan muhajirin dan anshar serta orang orang yang mengikuti jejak mereka dengan baik dan ia juga mengkhabarkan tentang ketulusan ridha mereka kepada allah serta apa yang telah ia sediakan untuk mereka dari jannah jannah surga surga yang penuh dengan kenikmatan dan kenikmatan yang abadi
2839171 maka jika mereka beriman kepada apa yang kamu telah beriman kepadanya sungguh mereka telah mendapat petunjuk dan jika mereka berpaling sesungguhnya mereka berada dalam permusuhan dengan kamu
2839172 sesungguhnya barang siapa di antara kalian yang hidup sepeninggalku nanti maka ia akan melihat perselisihan yang banyak
2839173 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam sebagaimana yang engkau saksikan telah mengiringkan sunnah al khulafa ar rasyidin dengan sunnah beliau dan bahwasanya di antara konsekuensi mengikuti sunnah beliau adalah mengikuti sunnah mereka yang demikian itu dikarenakan apa yang mereka sunnahkan benar benar mengikuti sunnah nabi mereka atau mengikuti apa yang mereka pahami dari sunnah beliau shallallahu alaihi wasallam baik secara global maupun secara rinci yang tidak diketahui oleh selain mereka
2839174 terus menerus ada sekelompok kecil dari umatku yang senantiasa tampil di atas kebenaran tidak akan memudharatkan mereka orang orang yang menghinakan mereka sampai datang keputusan allah dan mereka dalam keadaan seperti itu
2839175 kalau bukan ahlul hadits maka aku tidak tahu siapa mereka
2839176 hadits ini merupakan tanda dari tanda tanda kenabian rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam di dalamnya beliau telah menyebutkan tentang keutamaan sekelompok kecil yang senantiasa tampil di atas kebenaran dan setiap masa dari jaman ini tidak akan lengang dari mereka beliau shallallahu alaihi wasallam mendoakan mereka dan doa itupun terkabul maka allah azza wa jalla menjadikan pada tiap masa dan jaman sekelompok dari umat ini yang memperjuangkan kebenaran tampil di atasnya dan menerangkannya kepada umat manusia dengan sebenar benarnya keterangan sekelompok kecil ini secara yakin adalah ahlul hadits insya allah sebagaimana yang telah disaksikan oleh sejumlah ulama yang tangguh baik terdahulu ataupun di masa kini
2839177 umatku akan terpecah belah menjadi 73 golongan semuanya masuk ke dalam neraka kecuali satu golongan beliau ditanya siapa dia wahai rasulullah beliau menjawab golongan yang aku dan para sahabatku mengikuti
2839178 hadits ini sebagai nash dalil red dalam perselisihan karena ia dengan tegas menjelaskan tentang tiga perkara pertama bahwa umat islam sepeninggal beliau akan berselisih dan menjadi golongan golongan yang berbeda pemahaman dan pendapat di dalam memahami agama
2839179 wajib bagimu untuk mengikuti jejak salaf walaupun banyak orang menolakmu dan hati hatilah dari pemahaman pendapat tokoh tokoh itu walaupun mereka mengemasnya untukmu dengan kata kata yang indah
2839180 wajib bagimu untuk mengikuti atsar dan jalan yang ditempuh oleh salaf dan hati hatilah dari segala yang diada adakan dalam agama karena ia adalah bidah
2839181 syiar ahlus sunnah adalah mengikuti manhaj salafush shalih dan meninggalkan segala yang diada adakan dalam agama
2839182 barangsiapa menyelisihi sahabat dan tabiin salaf maka ia sesat walaupun banyak ilmunya
2839183 segala apa yang menyelisihi manhaj salaf maka ia adalah kesesatan
2839184 tidak tercela bagi siapa saja yang menampakkan manhaj salaf berintisab dan bersandar kepadanya bahkan yang demikian itu disepakati wajib diterima karena manhaj salaf pasti benar

2839187 business leaders are increasingly finding that theyre at the sharp end of the credit crunch and need to take stock of how they run their organisations in order to get the best from their employees

2839189 our patr n highcroft acura team did a great job with the strategy all of the acuras were fast today and we raced hard with them the porsches and the audis we made the call to pit late on a yellow flag period and then everyone else pitted for fuel but our strategy kept us out and we took over the lead i had to drive flat out to the end i caught up with a gt car on the front straight and an audi and franck montagny got run on me to get by in turn one i was only a few car lengths back when franck got together with the gt car they slid off the track and we powered by for the lmp2 lead it is exciting to be a part of this team it has grown into an excellent organization after being a new team in 2007
2839190 it is a great day for patr n highcroft racing i got stuck in some pretty tough traffic in the early portion of my stint but i was fast later on in my run i was able to get close to franck and adrian before handing the car back to david rob hill team manager and duncan dayton team owner made some amazing strategy calls that worked perfectly for us they had david pit for fuel under the yellow and gave us the lead when others fueled up winning three races this year is a tremendous feat for this young team i think we have a chance to win another one before the end of the year
2839191 its a sad day for us we had a great weekend until the last 30 minutes the car was fantastic for me on my first two stints adrian did a great job qualifying yesterday and was driving the car very well in the race unfortunately the suspension gave up when we were looking pretty good for our first win it is really disappointing for all the team
2839192 it was a tough day because we were looking good when i jumped in the car i think something may have been starting to happen turning right the car was quite loose through the carousel and the kink turning left the car was actually quite good we had a great pit stop strategy and i think we had a faster car than david brabham but then the left rear suspension broke and that was it its a shame for everybody luis did a fantastic job it is just one of those days i think it could have been a good day
2839193 i really dont know what to say we should have won today the xm acura was very fast and we were leading with about ten minutes to go i just cant believe the luck we have had with this team it is a good team and we should be winning races it is very frustrating
2839194 we had some highs and lows this weekend we won the pole with franck and we were in position to win the races andretti green racing had an amazing strategy and we were in the lead unfortunately we were taken out by another car we had a very good weekend and we did everything just right we just didnt get the victory today
2839195 it was unfortunate for our team today we had a car to run with the other acuras gil had some tough luck early and the team had to change a lot of bodywork but actually our acura was pretty good i think we ran laps with the leaders times we just need a little luck we have shown the speed to race for the win we need to put everything together during the races
2839196 we had a myriad of problems with our panasonic acura today i got hit by a slower car in turn three and we got stuck in the sand we had to change both the front and rear wings then the front wing didnt fit properly so we had to pit a couple of more times we ended up having several penalties for certain things i dont know the reason for many of them well have to discuss it with the alms officials once we got everything straightened out we were able to run similar as the leaders it was a shame we had the early problems
2839197 i think we are showing that any one of our acura
2839198 i think that when its your year things just seem to go your way like they did july 12 at nashville and here tonight there was some good racing with marco andretti tonight then it was crazy at the end helio castroneves made it very hard to pass but then he slowed going into turn three it definitely was a role reversal from chicago last year when dixon ran out of fuel on the last lap and was passed by dario franchitti for the race win and championship dario called me in victory circle and i told him the passing view was definitely better this is a fantastic day for us our championship lead is pretty healthy but anything can happen in a race and there are still three to go
2839199 i really dont know what i have to do to win a race this year honestly we took a big gamble with the fuel strategy i tried everything the team tried everything but it seems like second place is our destiny this year the fuel light came on with a couple of laps to go so we came up just a little bit short of fuel but were not giving up were working really really hard and there are still three races to go lets see what happens at the next race at sonoma

2839330 obviamente despu s de cada noche sale el sol y salen las gaviotas a volar y es que cuando el sol nace nace para todos
2839331 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi

2839339 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
2839340 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
2839341 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
2839342 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
2839343 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e

2839350 in til buscar un programa de recuperaci n que sea consistente con el pago de la deuda fijada por nuestros acreedores
2839351 nuestros peque os productores agr colas son masacrados por la brutal injusticia del entorno del comercio internacional
2839352 en la globalizaci n el campesino o campesina pierde su identidad social cultural y econ mica de productor ahora un campesino es consumidor de semillas y qu micos caros que venden las poderosas corporaciones trasnacionales por medio de poderosos latifundistas y prestamistas locales
2839353 a menudo lo han hecho en unos t rminos muy desfavorables para los granjeros pobres dejando a estos con m s inseguridad alimentaria y a los gobiernos a depender de unas ayudas internacionales poco predecibles
2839354 muchas de las empresas privadas que vinieron a reemplazar a los investigadores estatales resultaron ser monopolistas en busca de dinero
2839355 no pensamos que el coste humano de esos programas seria tan grande y que las ganancias econ micas tardasen tanto en llegar
2839356 el sector paraestatal continuar a siendo un riesgo para la exitosa implementaci n del presupuesto de 2002 03 las intervenciones del gobierno en la agricultura y otros mercados alimentarios est n socavando otras inversiones m s productivas

2839360 the village elders called me to say they were going to bury their dead and ask nato not to bomb
2839361 degenerated into a plain bandit group and are considered as lost command
2839362 all peaceful avenues have been exhausted to resolve the conflict
2839363 we are now compelled to resort to the application of proportionate and justifiable force so that peace and order may be restored in north cotabato
2839364 we have mobilized all forces including the military and police to overcome the effects of the floods

2839369 if ma can declassify the documents of the chen administration can he also declassify the documents concerning late presidents chiang kai shek and chiang ching kuo
2839370 what he has done has caused grave damage to the constitutional system and order
2839371 who would want to work for the president or give him advice if they have to constantly worry about being sued or called to testify in court
2839372 being jobless is not just a problem for the unemployed worker it also affects their circle of friends and their families
2839373 now i only work low paying part time jobs but i have five kids to feed all college students
2839374 all i want is for the government to help me find a stable job
2839375 social welfare resources should be spent on taking care of those who cant work
2839376 since were still capable of working providing job opportunities for us should be the priority
2839377 the psychological pressure of being jobless is the most troubling
2839378 our employer sends patrols from time to time to see if we are doing what they ask
2839379 from 3 30pm this corner will be in the shade of the neighboring building
2839380 the high temperature is tolerable but what is really annoying is the rain
2839381 the extra money nt 800 a day helps boost my earnings especially during a time when prices are rising
2839382 i doubt that the temporary staffing agencies pay insurance for these temporary workers who are among the most underprivileged in the work force the cla should investigate the issue
2839383 for the summer months the councils soil and water conservation bureau forestry bureau and taiwan forestry research institute are joining forces to host an array of summer nature health tours
2839384 more city folk are now spending their leisure time away from urban areas with 18 forestry recreational areas eight botanical gardens and 123 farming communities around the nation taiwanese have an array of good options to choose where to spend their free time
2839385 in addition children can get up close and personal with nature and make toys that their parents played with as children like whistles made out of tree leaves or stems or boomerangs made out of twigs
2839386 from now until september 20 city people can bring a farm passport when visiting these communities and by collecting stamps from each destination they can enter a raffle hosted by the council and win prizes such as laptop computers and bicycles
2839387 the very purpose of these attacks is all about separating the region from china
2839388 the council urged the chinese government to respect sports fans rights during the olympic games
2839389 they kept going through my stuff took away my cellphone and stopped me from answering it i felt horrible
2839390 i really dont know what to say they were really ridiculous suddenly i feel it is pitiful to be taiwanese
2839391 might not be able to make it back to taiwan this time
2839392 taiwanese did not enjoy home field advantage in beijing instead they were being discriminated against

2839394 one left on saturday and another two are supposed to leave today
2839395 if he is out of the picture weapons of mass destruction capability has been set back which would make this one of the more effective strikes in recent years
2839396 i believe that al qaeda has no shortage of people adept with explosives and i know that al masri promulgated training manuals for poisons
2839397 but im not sure how skilled any of proteges may be at synthesizing chemical weapons or toxins
2839398 you need both education and hands on experience to produce decent quality chemical weapons or toxins
2839399 from the us government perspective he was seen as a major threat his potential to develop primitive weapons of mass destruction was not taken lightly by us law enforcement and intelligence agencies
2839400 i told him not to go because its during the olympic games and this period is sensitive
2839401 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through
2839402 we are a family and well get through this together as a family
2839403 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2839404 i told him not to go because its during the olympic games and this period is sensitive
2839405 but he was determined to go because he said that church was where he was baptized so i went with him hoping to protect him
2839406 one al qaeda in iraq terrorist died when he detonated a vehicle borne bomb
2839407 there are certain things that are out of bounds for public discussion even if held in a private place
2839408 we believe open discussions and dialogues on issues of religious conversions are imperative to find solutions
2839409 not allowed to hold open discussions in relation to our constitution and its laws then it makes a complete mockery of our legal system
2839410 on aug 1 1936 adolf hitler opened the olympics in berlin boosting the morale of germans the ioc hoped that letting germany hold the olympics could make germany more democratic and peace loving but the result was the opposite
2839411 during the berlin olympics germany suddenly became peace loving and removed no jews signs hitler tried to make the world believe that germany was the friend of the whole world but history showed that hitler told a big lie
2839412 during the olympics hitler preached peace while building concentration camps after the olympics germany made the decision to kill millions of jews
2839413 shops in beijing are required to report suspicious looking people to police and apartment windows facing the main street in beijing must remain shut china is using the state machine to crush dissidence so the beijing olympics is a celebration held under martial law
2839414 but the morocco of poverty backward countryside and urban slums is increasingly averse to tourism and the internationalized elite
2839415 its discrimination by wealth and tourism is highlighting the sore
2839416 the syrians said that a visit at this time was inopportune
2839417 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
2839418 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2839419 by asking the iraqis to take responsibility for their future and to invest in their own country
2839420 senator mccain talks about putting our country first but he is running for a third term of the very same policies that have set our country back
2839421 and begun to end the tyranny of oil in our time
2839422 i would be very direct with russian president sic vladimir putin that these actions will have consequences long term in terms of our relationship with russia and it is in violation of the norms of international conduct
2839423 a genuinely neutral mediator not the russian government must begin a process of negotiations immediately
2839424 even the most stirring speeches are easily forgotten when theyre short on content taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall
2839425 the ghaffur case will expose the true position in relation to the discrimination within scotland yard at the highest level it will reveal the reality of racism in the met it is a massive claim that could destroy the commissioner and his golden circle
2839426 if you were in a bad mood he would make you in a great mood
2839427 a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know

2839432 there are a number of variables that need to be solved before we can accurately project a trial date chief among them whether the judge will affirm pro se self representation for those who requested it and then management of that process if it comes to pass
2839433 constantly under pressure from consumers unlike china a socialist country where in principle you do not have to tell consumers anything or you can keep inconvenient things under wraps
2839434 it has a disproportionate influence on the space in terms of its overwhelming smell the cultural idea of it and the operational problems created by the mess it produces
2839435 after the fight police arrested mohammad and me and forced us to confess
2839436 this man had the use of specialized medical facilities and equipment to treat the leaders of farc
2839437 direct demonstrations of defense techniques gives our attendees knowledge and tools they can take home and use immediately
2839438 there are few training events that do what we do we show attacks and how to fix them our conference adds an element fun to the serious nature of security
2839439 the only thing we have to think about now is how to find food for tomorrow having enough food to eat like we had before seems to be a dream now
2839440 the vast majority of families simply dont have enough to eat
2839441 the message i want the world to know is that the government un agencies and other organizations are making good progress said ramesh shrestha a un representative in yangon
2839442 our operations are contingent on having a positive relationship with the government
2839443 so we have to work out a fine balance so that the difficult issues are dealt with but in a spirit of cooperation
2839444 what we have learned over the years is that direct confrontation with the government is not the way to solve problems
2839445 still more bureaucratic and unpredictable than in the ideal world
2839446 i think thats where the needs still are quite considerable and thats where well focus the relief efforts over the next few months
2839447 the donors arent going to give us money if they know they will lose a percentage of that
2839448 i dont expect any help from the government i just know that if i ask them for help i would have to give them something in return but i have nothing now
2839449 the only thing we have to think about now is how to find food for tomorrow having enough food to eat like we had before seems to be a dream now
2839450 by 2010 most of chinas anti access forces will be in place making it very difficult to use pacific forces to help taiwan
2839451 treat me like gum stuck to the bottom of your shoe once shame on you treat me like gum stuck to the bottom of your shoe twice shame on me
2839452 dont look too hard for mr perfect and im sure youll find mr right
2839453 stolen water is sweet so lets drink it in the darkness if you know what i mean
2839454 fueron interceptados por un grupo de hombres armados al parecer del eln que los obligaron a bajar de sus veh culos y en el suelo los acribillaron
2839455 entre los muertos hay dos o tres personas reconocidas en el comercio de sustancias il citas

2839457 any ancient deeply rooted autonomous culture especially if it is spread on a wide part of the earths surface constitutes an autonomous world full of riddles and surprises to western thinking for 1 000 years russia has belonged to such a category
2839458 an example of genuine devotion and selfless serving of the people fatherland and the ideals of freedom justice and humanism
2839459 as late as 1966 he khrushchev sent me new years greetings which astonished me because i was on the brink of arrest perhaps in his disgrace he did not know
2839460 hes a well polished opponent and i beat him by more than 10 points saunders said exuberantly
2839461 its going to be tough but i just have to stick it out and give it my all
2839462 i think that was a mature performance from a man who isnt 19 yet and against a world bronze medallist
2839463 he showed tremendous maturity billy is a bit more mature than khan to be honest with you amir was a bit quicker with his hands but billy is very good with his head and can adapt to any style
2839464 its an honor to be leading ive been training really hard for this
2839465 but were only four races into this this is a very long event were not even halfway through ill take it one day and one race at a time and just keep on moving
2839466 he had a fantastic opportunity to protest me and probably get me disqualified so i had to take a penalty turn which cost me distance
2839467 its the olympics and you try and you do anything you can to get an advantage on your opponent and most of the fleet try and give me a hard time when they can
2839468 hes sailing really well hes been in the class for three years and continually improving we will have to see if we can give him a hard time in the next couple of days
2839469 seeing tae hwan go so fast in the 400m freestyle i cant afford to relax
2839470 its not always pretty but we have the aussie spirit and a lot of heart
2839471 we believed korea was a real threat going into the game so to come out and beat them is really a feather in our cap
2839472 there was a bit of pressure since this was our first match but i was motivated when i saw so many people had come to watch the match
2839473 i am sure the fans will continue to support us in the rest of the competition we will try not to disappoint them
2839474 these girls are very fast and it was hard for our defense to adjust to them
2839475 they controlled the tempo of the game after scoring those two goals and the support from the crowd was also helping them
2839476 i am satisfied with my performance today and we are both very happy because we are on home soil in china we are very proud to have won
2839477 its so exciting having our own people cheer for us and hopefully there will be more to celebrate in the coming days
2839478 i am not thinking of life after these games everything i do is focused on winning here
2839479 we worked hard and trained hard every day for this competition we made a lot of preparations training from morning to night so although it looked easy to you we earned it we were under a lot of pressure before the competition but we just focused on making sure we did what we had to do
2839480 i am pleased with the result it was different diving here with anastasia compared to vera but i am pleased with the way it went here
2839481 congratulations to the winners they deserved it and we are just happy to have got our first medal
2839482 i think this is the child that was reported missing she was by the shoes
2839483 theyre really good characters and we get on with them despite us only speaking three words of chinese and them only speaking three words of english

2839502 last year a customer who left with 8 000 euros us 12 200 worth of purchases it was a basic sale this summer when we sell 3 000 or 4 000 euros worth were happy
2839503 we have made fewer sales but for sums that were often very considerable one customer left with items worth more than 50 000 euros
2839504 yachts of more than 40m belonging to the super rich are still there but with the 15m to 35m yachts there is a very big drop in numbers
2839505 we are easily at a third of last years business there are far fewer people coming to saint tropez just to anchor for the evening
2839506 this summer an average of 30 boats are anchored compared to some 60 in previous years
2839507 i have never seen this before our clients came here for a total break this year they are at their computers from 8am
2839508 in four years its the first time that i have received this type of message unfortunately we are far from being full unlike last summer
2839509 people who have a lot of money are ready to spend but they have become more demanding over quality
2839510 when you spend 1 500 euros a day on a private beach you expect a high level of service in saint tropez however it has not always been the case
2839511 maybe if oil prices ease the company will consider reinstating the service
2839512 should the technology advance to the extent where infrastructure costs can be lowered the company will also re evaluate the option of relaunching the service
2839513 the high operating costs of internet services would force the airline to charge passengers an additional fee
2839514 the global dram dynamic random access memory market is showing renewed signs of weakness with prices expected to fall during the third quarter due to bloated inventories
2839515 the main question now facing the industry is how much prices will decline during the third quarter we believe it will be over 10 percent from current level
2839516 a meaningful recovery in the near term is uncertain especially given the current divergence in spot and contracted memory prices
2839517 while some industry players are expecting demand to recover in september a meaningful rebound is unlikely as powerchip and rexchip electronics corp which are migrating to 65 nanometer technology may increase overall dram supply again if their yields gain maturity soon
2839518 the market share battle between hynix and elpida could delay the market recovery
2839519 elpida clearly wants to be no 2 soon while hynix will try to reduce its nand flash memory growth and to increase dram production to retain its market share
2839520 by assigning more weight to economic growth the government can take better care of disadvantaged people and the nations financial health
2839521 reform proposals that have a negative impact on the stock market have little chance of being implemented
2839522 since the committee cannot have it all members believe it should seek to take care of as many people as possible
2839523 when they choose to leave even though they are benefiting
2839524 shareholders may wonder if there is something sneaky going on
2839525 you can check out anytime you like but you can never leave
2839526 i think there is a grave risk that the advantage may be lost because of the continued chipping away at the rock
2839527 it just doesnt seem like the right time or the right place to be engaged in a serious deregulation of financial markets
2839528 we expect shipments of the top five original design notebook manufacturers to regain growth momentum in september following likely flat shipments in august on the back of the continuing resilient strength of orders
2839529 however we have to highlight that the growth momentum in the third quarter should come mainly from channel inventory building and we still need to watch sell through risk closely in the fourth quarter as visibility of end demand is still poor
2839530 non accredited persons do not fall within the iocs remit
2839531 it makes sense to have greater cooperation but i dont think were ready to have one global super regulator
2839532 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities
2839533 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2839534 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty
2839535 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2839536 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple
2839537 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2839538 it shows people are getting proficient at analyzing apple software
2839539 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised
2839540 i could force you to download child porn or send subversive material to china
2839541 the exploitation is almost limitless google has to fix it
2839542 it turns out a lot of people who develop these things arent good at security
2839543 weve been telling google about these vulnerabilities for years and they have not made corrective actions
2839544 they chose to open the doors and insomuch put a lot of consumers at risk
2839545 ypbf has become owner of shells share in transredes at a price established by the national government
2839546 ive played her before so i knew what to expect
2839547 i saw early on that he was playing way back on my first serve
2839548 im going to have to pressure him in the corners
2839549 he looks like hes 25 hes got a huge game
2839550 if you are going to tackle climate change and curb energy use you have to deal with consumer devices like pcs
2839551 there are large potential savings beyond what energy star can do
2839552 what were trying to do is raise the visibility of the power consumption problem on the pc desktop and really bring power management to the masses
2839553 this kind of energy saving technology for consumers is a key ingredient in moving toward that goal
2839554 almost perfect yesterday i finished very nice and now with this round i cant believe it i have a chance for tomorrow
2839555 i will be out there to help her to get a better score i have always said that she is going to be my biggest competitor
2839556 if the world were to draw any lessons from what i did there would never be any wars we shouldnt really stoop so low to wage wars against each other
2839557 ebays drive for growth has killed the auction format they are trying to compete with amazon and the rest of e commerce by giving you everything in the same search
2839558 not many people bid for rechargeable batteries gillette razor blades toothbrushes or even mobile phone handsets or dvds the kind of commodity items you pick up in a supermarket ebay started out for the collectors market but its been overtaken by the business market buyers have become used to instant sales on the internet and they expect ebay to be no different
2839559 ebays drive for growth has killed the auction format they are trying to compete with amazon and the rest of e commerce by giving you everything in the same search buy it now and fixed price added growth at first but theyve killed the golden goose
2839560 sellers have decided theyre not going to ebay any longer ive seen a lot saying that theyre going back to the things they did before ebay the flea markets the trade shows it means those rare items arent on ebay any more
2839561 today fixed price accounts for over 40 percent of the value of all our sales well continue to innovate to bring parity to selling in fixed price alongside auctions and choice for buyers to shop whichever way they want
2839562 the current noticeable weakening in the yuan has never happened before
2839563 previously when the dollar rebounded the yuan would either move sideways or appreciate more slowly
2839564 we attribute it to the shift in domestic policy the central bank has adjusted its policy for a slower speed in appreciation
2839565 use various monetary policy tools to create good conditions for stable relatively fast growth
2839566 we do not believe the chinese authorities will defy the law of gravity to engineer a sustained renminbi depreciation despite persistent forex inflow
2839567 it is likely that the central bank may fine tune its intervention policy to effect a slower appreciation in the short run
2839568 the economy is still in good shape with consumption spending and export growth both much stronger than almost anyone expected a few months ago
2839569 when most labels were banging their heads he got it and saw the liberating value of internet distribution to artists and thats what excited him
2839570 he has a very good sense technologically of whats going to work
2839571 he carries all the latest gadgets understands what the artistic involvement can be and is very clued up on the business model thats an extremely unusual combination and he does it in a chummy way
2839572 be it 78s 45s lps or cds it changes the shape of the music with downloading the artistic change hasnt really hit yet but its turned the economic model on its head the major record companies have some smart people looking at digital models but the question is will the people at the top be willing to turn the business upside down
2839573 today i have a different view its a way to hold onto income for creators
2839574 peter approaches business the way he approaches his music its not digital its organic
2839575 i am impressed that hes achieved so much in the business world
2839576 apprentices need to complete their training if it is to fully benefit themselves or their employer so increasing completion rates is absolutely vital to the success of apprenticeships ten years on from the minimum wage becoming law millions of low paid workers have benefited from better pay and protection from exploitation its now time for apprentices to benefit from these rights too
2839577 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2839578 we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars
2839579 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
2839580 without doubt the biggest metal event this year is going to be the release of metallicas new album
2839581 i cant believe we dont win a race in three or four weeks and were in a slump
2839582 nuestra actividad p blica y los recursos de la gente no a actividades pol ticas que dividen a los mexicanos sino a problemas que realmente afectan a la gente como es el caso de la seguridad p blica
2839583 si estuvi ramos m s unidos el gobierno federal y las autoridades estatales en este caso del distrito federal seguramente hubi ramos avanzado m s en el camino de mejorar la calidad de la polic a as que hago un llamado a las autoridades del df para que dejemos de lado de una vez las diferencias pol ticas sin claudicar en principios y convicciones y nos pongamos juntos a resolver problemas que s lo juntos podremos resolver como es el caso de la inseguridad p blica particularmente en la ciudad de m xico
2839584 i just dont know where wall streets brains are today
2839585 everyone on the street is wringing their hands over housing when in fact the average american has been out this spring buying homes and pushing the median price higher this has got to go down as one of wall street and main streets biggest disconnects in history
2839586 rising prices on expanding volume should not a crisis make on wall street
2839587 they say that there are bulls and bears on wall street but there are also pigs pigs try not just to profit from a crisis but create one to profit from today there are just so many people who have positioned themselves to profit from a crisis that they refuse to admit the reality of what is happening on main street it might hurt their positions
2839588 no one can know for sure but the hard data is clear the median price has risen four straight months the average american is out there taking advantage of bargains in their local real estate market they are not listening to wall street but following their own belief that the best time to buy is when no one else is and they are out there buying if this keeps up february may prove to have been the low in prices
2839589 at this time were focusing on the health and welfare of the guests involved in this tragic accident
2839590 o aumento dos pre os teve impacto negativo sobre o consumo as fam lias gastaram mais mas levaram menos produtos para casa devido alta da infla o
2839591 certamente a queda do consumo efeito da infla o neste momento recente em que a infla o dos principais produtos aliment cios subiu n o houve muita escapat ria as pessoas tiveram de diminuir o consumo de parte de outros produtos como bebidas
2839592 s o produtos de alt ssimo valor agregado e dispens veis
2839593 n o diria que contradit rio com o estudo da fgv a classe m dia cresceu em renda e emprego e passou a consumir mais diversos produtos s que essas classes tamb m consomem produtos caros como autom veis e im veis cujo risco de perda por conta de n o pagamento grande fica mais dif cil deixar de pagar esses produtos
2839594 mas de qualquer maneira para todas as classes de renda e produto devemos come ar a ver uma desacelera o de crescimento de consumo principalmente em 2009
2839595 i loved that all of the supplies i needed were right there in my own home flour and water for paste recycled newspapers tin foil for an armature and i loved the truly organic nature of it
2839596 people are my favorite subjects when i first began sculpting as a young woman i worked solely in paper m ch i considered myself a feminist and the female form was my favorite subject i created big fat bold naked women women dancing mostly women expressing themselves in their own beautiful way i love to distort the body big noses giant butts my aim was to accentuate flaws to express what really makes each of us unique and beautiful
2839597 its funny how life changes though im not exactly sure why my subject matter changed but it has in a drastic way gone are the big beautiful confident women and now these small anxiety ridden worried dead kids come out could it be marriage a mortgage and motherhood perhaps in 2004 we lost our home in hurricane katrina we lost everything we owned plus a fairly large body of my artwork it took about a year before our life returned to any kind of normalcy im quite sure this had a bearing on my expressive outlet i think the experience taught me not to take life so seriously and to appreciate whats really important
2839598 i dont know exactly what it is the music the culture the history the people all of this makes this such a unique and inspirational city being here brings a joy to my heart and this of course encourages ones creative spirit
2839599 once upon a time in the earliest of societies there was no such thing as marriage and people would just have sex and have babies with whoever
2839600 it hurts my feelings when i was hoping we could figure out a new way to handle the situation together
2839601 i know were close and we can share everything but id really appreciate it if youd leave the room or leave me out when you do that its not very sexy and i dont want anything that makes you less sexy to me
2839602 business leaders are increasingly finding that theyre at the sharp end of the credit crunch and need to take stock of how they run their organisations in order to get the best from their employees
2839603 in these tough financial times employers are facing a difficult challenge to keep their staff motivated with many trying to find low cost incentives to encourage and reward productivity
2839604 if you had been in president clintons place would you have resigned
2839605 if i had been in the presidents place i would not have gotten the chance to resign i would have been lying in a pool of my own blood looking up and listening to my wife ask how do you reload this damn thing
2839606 provides a framework for growth at verizon and a good standard of living with careers for our members
2839607 focused on delivering to our customers the best in broadband communications and entertainment
2839608 met our goals to protect the retirees who helped to build this company and ensure future jobs for union members
2839609 the nba is great if you are a star but if not you get moved around my friend georgi glouchkov played a year in phoenix he tells me bad stories about nba the guards did not like him they dont pass him the ball i would not like that i could not stand that
2839610 id like to see a list of these white supremacists web sites just to see if they really exist
2839611 perhaps if he had taken a look around once in a while at all the good people who were helping him up he might have realized that he didnt get where he was all alone
2839612 a resident in the south blount utility district said they got a notice of violation of safe drinking water standards indicating their drinking water was contaminated with high levels of lead
2839613 it was a touching moment and a lovely display of republican family values
2839614 the very sad thing is there are people that one wouldnt readily categorize as being racist in any other situation that do feel that obama being president would
2839615 one thing about davis he has consistently blamed democrats for all the national and regional ills and now he blames them for not being re elected
2839616 taking a stand against chinas big redemptive pr show by declining to attend wouldve been consistent and coherent
2839617 lets set aside the question of whether our expectations have sunk so low that we actually give kudos to politicians for just doing the right thing
2839618 katie allison granju signed off for the last time at knoxville talks yesterday
2839619 katies only been gone one day and look what happens
2839620 high tech companies arent going to move to an area that doesnt support education and only graduates people qualified to work in call centers
2839621 glenn greenwald along with jane hamsher of firedoglake and a variety of other pro democracy bloggers and activists is helping establish
2839622 only i would be watching judo badminton chinese women lifting weights and some dude trotting around on a horse doing half circles simultaneously live from beijing on a saturday morning
2839623 how amazing it was to watch as you turned within 48 hours from an attacking congressional candidate to a national pariah
2839624 and speaking of honesty she and her friends standing in the dark in the house chamber might want to stop claiming that off shore drilling will give us immediate relief from high gas prices
2839625 once again the gop leadership sided with oil profiteers and used their power to help keep oil prices and profits high while hurting the average american
2839626 if passion alone won elections it would be a landslide for tuke this fall should he get the nomination
2839627 this is my second funeral in three weeks of people i grew up with
2839628 if this is the chairmans take on the craziest sh t to come down the pipe since oh i dont know a member of the tndp executive committee accused the democratic presidential nominee of ties to terrorism it will be very revealing indeed when mr
2839629 thank heavens the white kids in nashvilles public schools are doing so well academically
2839630 the piece discusses the increased interest in bicycling that has accompanied higher gasoline prices
2839631 i have trouble understanding the separation between the roane alliance a county government function supported by our tax dollars and the chamber of commerce
2839632 todays message is simple all the gobs have to do is wait long enough and the voters of this county will forget whatever transgressions may have angered them in the past
2839633 to shield itself from public accountability the white house crafted rules which ignored centuries of legal precedent and tossed aside even the barest semblance of justice in favor of a system automatically tilted toward the prosecution
2839634 also please ask whomever is your choice for president why he bought 5 6 million dollars in advertising during the olympics knowing what china is doing in darfur tibet berma and other human and animal rights violations
2839635 of course the malkin tents are going to claim another victory but hey look at it this way we liberals can snicker at them for defending a holiday with communist socialist origins founded by the evil labor unions
2839636 forty five percent of volunteering in tennessean is performed in the religious sector whereas that number is 63 in utah
2839637 this this i believe explains the virulent anti mexican sentiment here in the south
2839638 the past is not dead in fact its not even past
2839639 id hate to be an incumbent republican in two years
2839640 regardless of intent the regulation certainly could functionally allow the defining of contraceptives as abortion
2839641 ive come across several blog entries recently that recount stories of women being lied to by their healthcare providers and or being lectured on the basis of their providers personal values
2839642 i think a decision is going to be made soon ive had a great time here i was fortunate enough to play on a team that made the playoffs i led the team in scoring three of the four seasons ive been here its been a good experience but we havent been able to come to any common ground its just part of the business you have to do what you have to do sometimes
2839643 thats so unfair to all that jen has so talented at both comedy and drama
2839644 where are you from that its ok to do insert hideous act or words here
2839645 their sunshine infused optimism fuelled material is made more poignant by this defiant refusal to be disheartened by a world so jaded every cut apparently only made it to tape if it made the band want to dance
2839646 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
2839647 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
2839648 me perdoe dr jigoro kano por ter inventado esse nome
2839649 se isso for um ippon eu paro com o jud
2839650 this is completely unacceptable especially from the lips of a representative of a country whose action we are aware of in iraq afghanistan and serbia
2839651 whose strollers are those how come theres a baby here crying but where is the mommy
2839652 no se que edad ten a pues era un cr o pero mi recuerdo m s antiguo lo tengo de alcal de gazules est bamos all en la plaza del pueblo jugando al escondite con mi hermano y algunos amigos cuando me di cuenta que todo el mundo empezaba a meterse con una ni a no se por que pero la pobre estaba pas ndolo muy mal no me lo pens dos veces y fui a defenderla y a enfrentarme con quien hiciera falta me sent entonces como el pr ncipe valiente no cab a dentro de m por que la gente se retir y la dejaron en paz desde aquel momento nos hicimos muy amigos
2839653 es que mi madre desde que le puse la peluquer a ya no cocina
2839654 consider the work of god for who can make that straight which he hath made crooked
2839655 we may wait till he explains because we know that jesus reigns
2839656 no better time to buy a new home no better place
2839657 if families who want to buy a new home wait for the media to tell them things are better it will be too late and the deals wont be there
2839658 there were 272 single family homes sold last month in miami dade county puny tallahassee and pensacola sold nearly as many even though the areas population and housing stock are but a fraction of dade
2839659 if you dont buy now youll never be able to afford to
2839660 it is incredibly sad to hear how many youngsters are bullied or isolated for not having the same clothes or accessories as their classmates
2839661 a lot of advertising companies blatantly target children without any consideration for the parents of those children
2839662 they need to be up to date otherwise they get left out and have low self esteem
2839663 it is often the children who you would expect to have least such as a family on benefits who have all the branded stuff and tease others
2839664 schools and colleges should be places where all children feel equal but it is virtually impossible for schools to protect their pupils from the harsher aspects of these commercial influences
2839665 ong tee keat may want to continue with personal attacks but i will continue to work i feel party members are more interested in a president who will work hard to revive our party
2839666 whether or not my apology is acceptable it is up to the mca members to decide
2839667 lone ranger who has few allies or loyal following with very few members relating to his style of leadership
2839668 the first official message ever in which he speaks english
2839669 calls for the people to support jihad in pakistan and lists a litany of grievances against the pakistani government and us involvement there
2839670 he also relates his own personal experiences having lived in pakistan in an apparent attempt to build a stronger connection with the pakistani people
2839671 wants to speaks directly to the pakistani people and chose english because he cannot speak urdu
2839672 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
2839673 good politicians like good scientists draw conclusions from facts bad politicians like bad scientists draw facts from conclusions
2839674 pyrethroids were responsible for more than 26 percent of all major and moderate human incidents involving pesticides in the united states in 2007 up from just 15 percent in 1998 a 67 percent increase
2839675 farmers will be subjected to conjecture and allegations about their use of chemicals and fertilizers
2839676 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
2839677 da noi sdraio e lettino costano meno dello stabilimento a fianco
2839678 good morning but only just are you still lying in sleepy head did i wake you
2839679 okay so where lost cities is that such a good idea
2839680 yes i want to do a kind of budget traveller thing through turkey and get to see some places not so much choked with tourists but with history
2839681 it sounds like a horrible holiday no beach bums no club drunks and no aircon
2839682 thats funny you just described my ideal one i especially want to see ephesus then maybe ill see if i can catch a bus trip or something back to england for a bit
2839683 dont tell me youve decided to cut back on air flights to help reduce carbon emissions right
2839684 why do you keep pushing yourself why do you think you constantly need reforming
2839685 now where did that tirade come from just because i want to visit out of the way destinations
2839686 you know what i mean you are on this constant mission to reform yourself to change to move cant you stay still for one summer and let me enjoy your company
2839687 id invite you to join me but you couldnt possibly live in a backpack and why do you make reformation sound like a dirty word you liked reformation well enough the other day when you said turks reformed islam
2839688 religion needs reformation to keep up with modern thinking you dont
2839689 if religion needs reformation then surely it defeats its purpose isnt the idea of organised religion there to reform you
2839690 oh dont start getting all philosophical on me so early in the day
2839691 when i said hi just now you made it sound as though morning had broken long ago
2839692 look mister do you want me to blow another raspberry in your ear
2839693 will you just promise me to keep safe there are some horrible people out there in the world it isnt a safe place
2839694 that the opposite is also true we are the only animal that often helps each other for the pleasure of it too if we understand that theres not much that can go wrong really its a sad fact that even though we set high ideals for ourselves we often fail to live to them but the point is to try regardless
2839695 you crazy silly foolish optimist i adore you im going to miss you this island wont be the same without you
2839696 riding a horse is not a gentle hobby to be picked up and laid down like a game of solitaire it is a grand passion
2839697 will i get to wear a real invisibility cloak for the next harry potter movie premier or do i have to stick with my moms old linens
2839698 theres nothing in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos
2839699 i was shooting oceans twelve i was shooting this guess who i was shooting commercials i was shooting television i hadnt had a break in 8 years i hadnt played golf in 3 i hadnt done anything social in 3 years
2839700 i was over in europe i was over in amsterdam i was over in paris flying back here then i caught pneumonia double then they gave me this medicine called methotrexate thats good for pneumonia and the doctors are really high on this medicine one of out a hundred it dont fit you and i was the one it gave me toxicity
2839701 a non muslim may not become a citizen of the maldives
2839702 this denial of citizenship to non muslims is an extraordinarily harsh measure which places the maldives among the worst countries in the world in regards to the legal foundation for freedom of religion and belief
2839703 religious freedom is a very important part of our constitution the maldivian government understands our concern that this clause contravenes international conventions it is a party to
2839704 no maldives politician would want to take the case up
2839705 it will be very difficult for maldives mentality to accept maldives citizens may belong to a different faith
2839706 the student accommodation situation has been worsened by the current credit crunch
2839707 over the last two weeks how often have you been bothered by the following problem thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way
2839708 it is worrying that despite improvements in cancer care a substantial number of patients feel they would be better off dead
2839709 we know that depression is common in patients who have cancer but it is often missed pain is also a big problem treating patients symptoms as well as their disease might improve and even save their lives
2839710 i have been training a lot with my brother to achieve this win
2839711 the main rules have not changed since the beginning of the competition ten years ago
2839712 we have six men or women sitting inside the sauna on each round and the winner is the last one to leave
2839713 there are no world records we cannot control all the factors like the temperature of the sauna or the water thrown into the stove
2839714 in the case of invisibility cloaks or shields the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river around a rock
2839715 at the moment customers have to rely on guess work if they want to make healthier choices
2839716 people are eating out more than they used to if companies are genuinely serious about wanting to offer healthy choices they need to give customers up front information
2839717 i think people are often unaware of the calorie and fat content of things like coleslaw and that information needs to be much more readily available it is not about banning burgers it is about giving people the facts to make healthy choices
2839718 in order to help our customers make informed choices we provide extensive nutritional information online as well as displaying information on our tray liners in store
2839719 subway stores provide nutritional information to customers via in store nutritional brochures and on the website in order to enable consumers to make an informed choice about the food they are buying
2839720 we have an eh postcode here in north berwick so we are still officially edinburgh and there is an entry in the festival guide
2839721 we thought it was about time we brought some of the festival magic down the coast to north berwick
2839722 the fringe has become a huge event and very crowded for both visitors and performers so we decided to give people the chance to escape the city but not miss out on seeing some shows
2839723 weve also thrown in the sun sand and fish suppers mix just to complete the fringe on the sea picture
2839724 we have received great support both from the community and sponsorship from east lothian council and the tourist board
2839725 we are just adding to the edinburgh fringe to make it even bigger
2839726 we are just a few miles from the city so we wanted to take full advantage of that
2839727 one of the best things about the fringe is that anyone can bring any show they want and stage it wherever they want different developments like this make the fringe what it is
2839728 we are making inroads into the online market with our groundbreaking licensing deals with itunes youtube and bebo with further gains anticipated in the year
2839729 the decrease of 15 per cent in cd sales was overturned by innovation and growth in licensing in other areas of the business
2839730 the impact of this on my life and my family is hard to imagine i have lost everything my job my health and i have had years of a happy retirement stolen from me
2839731 i am very shocked i cannot see if we should live in this area any more it is a tough area but convenient for the university i cannot believe this has happened
2839732 sometimes local children attack us i dont know whether it is because we come from another country
2839733 as helpless in the grip of his sex drive as of his political ambitions
2839734 i would have thought if they really wanted to get away from it they wouldnt be reading history or biographies i think they would gain as much from reading imaginative fiction or historical fiction
2839735 we were running out of fuel we either had to do it then or not for an hour because we would have had to refuel and come back
2839736 he was around 700 metres from the compound when they came in
2839737 the only way to stop them escaping is to encircle them immediately
2839738 you dont know whether the people in there are going to fight against you or try and escape
2839739 if you land on every side you land light and you risk a blue on blue friendly fire incident
2839740 its frustrating more than anything the blokes were all psyched up but they ran away when they heard us coming
2839741 you can change anything you want but just dont touch the rates
2839742 family members believe it is a medical condition that might have led to his death mr hayes was being treated for a number of medical issues
2839743 obviously for those families who would benefit its very welcome news but it doesnt go far enough we are looking at energy bills on average going up 400 since the beginning of the year
2839744 i think the government has this idea it will do a bit here and a bit there without really addressing the problem what they really need to do is think quite fundamentally about some of these issues and how best to make sure people can afford the energy they need
2839745 energy like food and shelter is a basic necessity as a civilised society we must make sure that everybody can afford the basic necessities
2839746 this is blatant indiscriminate electioneering in one of the final winters before the general election
2839747 the protection of those least able to heat their homes is a priority for the government we will continue to work with energy companies amongst others on measures to help the most vulnerable to reduce the amount of energy they use and to lower their bills
2839748 with high fuel prices the coming winter will be difficult for many families and we are committed to supporting them the government is continuing to consider the best ways of meeting this challenge
2839749 i opened this store about a year ago business has been ok now i dont know how im going to afford to fix it up
2839750 the need to belong in groups is paramount to young learners and exclusion is something they see as the end of the world
2839751 bullying of this kind can be quite insidious it can just be a look that a child is given
2839752 children feel under immense pressure to look right and having the key brands is part of that
2839753 young people are image conscious and a lot of bullying is based on appearance
2839754 targeting others for not having the right look accessory or brand is unfortunately all too common but it is precisely the sort of behaviour beatbullying can help change
2839755 i came over the line and there was so much i was just so happy and there were so many emotions that were coming out all at once i made so much noise because i guess thats just the person i am
2839756 normally im good in the rain but the problem was that it was really cold
2839757 this is a great start to the beijing olympics for team gb and i have no doubt this medal will fire up the rest of the team to do their best in the next two weeks
2839758 well done to nicole cooke she has set us on our way
2839759 since theyve been here theyve been eating sea pinks thistle heads and seeds they are not in any danger and eventually they will move on in their continual quest for food
2839760 it is a rare appearance and anything rare is exciting people have been taking photos of them and they are beginning to attract a few tourists
2839761 there appears to have been a good breeding season and normally if there were enough cones they would feed and then start to disperse in their own homeland but this year there hasnt been enough food to support the population
2839762 with so many juveniles among them this clearly follows the classic situation of a successful breeding season followed by a sudden food shortage
2839763 the birds are believed to be coming directly from norway where similar numbers have been reported recently according to the norwegian rare bird database the past week has seen a flock of 18 at fillingsnes with reports of one to three at eight other locations
2839764 here the other main location has been fair isle midway between shetland and orkney currently there is a group of nine juveniles at buness the headland near the islands world famous bird observatory
2839765 it certainly is an extraordinary influx they were clearly different to an earlier group of four an adult male and three females at malcolms head at the opposite corner of the island
2839766 the 22 recorded on shetland include three elsewhere on mainland shetland and three on the isles of fetlar unst and yell orkneys 11 include four on the isle of south ronaldsay the others on mainland orkney and the isles of north ronaldsay and stronsay
2839767 there is a strong feeling that this may be just the beginning and there are still a lot more to come
2839768 the big problem for those already here is that they are unable to find their normal food some have been seen feeding on wild plants such as umbellifers thrift and dandelions one of the orkney birds came to feed on peanuts put out for garden birds at queenmidda
2839769 this is what we call an irruption or an influx of birds due to a food shortage if this keeps happening there could be a lot more and we might even see them in the central belt
2839770 the birds on the northern isles stand out because of the lack of cover birds reaching mainland britain are liable to disappear quickly into forests until much later in the year
2839771 birds cause some considerable problems in the forms of noise and dirt not only do their droppings damage and contaminate property the birds also carry various diseases such as salmonella
2839772 food put out for the birds will also attract rats and vermin
2839773 if we establish that a nuisance or pest problem does exist we may have to reconsider further action
2839774 let them put me in jail its just crazy what do they mean by noise id hardly describe the dawn chorus as noise
2839775 we would encourage people to feed their garden birds throughout the year
2839776 this is an important time when a lot of adolescent birds are putting down fat to see them through the winter and they need to feed up
2839777 over half of adults in the uk feed birds in their garden
2839778 a lot of film makers just dont know how to scare people anymore theres not that many genuinely scary films anymore
2839779 there was once a formula for scary films but it was deconstructed in the scary movie series as a way to reinvigorate the genre then people went to torture porn theyre not scary but theyre about how much gore an audience can take
2839780 it was an advantage to be more anxious in a dangerous environment
2839781 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety still to identify the first candidates for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
2839782 i would immediately signal a long term desire to replace the council tax
2839783 while people are paying so much of their monthly income in council tax in comparison to their mortgage or income tax they feel as though the system is not working for them thats largely a product of the way the tax has developed over the years the way that revaluations have not taken place
2839784 i believe in a property tax but we should be open to other ideas including elements of land value tax too if they are found to be workable
2839785 these are difficult and complex issues and we must spend the time as a party to get this right
2839786 she believes there needs to be a property based tax but there is still a lot of work needing to be done
2839787 the time has come for a partnership of equals between party and government north and south of the border a more autonomous scottish labour party with real political freedom within a radically reformed union with a new relationship to uk labour makes sense in 2008
2839788 develop new constitutional futures for scotland without having to defer to westminster
2839789 an autonomous labour party in scotland or something approaching that could be better placed to offer an alternative to independence as a vision for the future as well as providing effective opposition and advocacy on the policy front
2839790 the relationship between scottish labour and the uk westminster party needs to be reviewed and rewritten to reflect the new realities
2839791 labour are fighting like ferrets in a sack on whether or not the party in scotland should be autonomous and whether or not they support a referendum on scottish independence
2839792 if it materialises we would perhaps come back and live nearby
2839793 i think we need to do better in general lots of people in scotland are aware of the environment but this evidence suggests there are areas that they can definitely improve
2839794 patients are diagnosed quickly and treated appropriately in childrens cancer centres
2839795 their treatment is closely supervised in the right kind of environment by the right team
2839796 there has been a huge history of research trials that have little by little chipped away and improved the prognosis all children unfortunately are not cured and until we find some other way of tackling it there will always remain a small percentage of patients who do relapse
2839797 the outlook for that unfortunately is pretty much uniformly fatal
2839798 thats a great advantage because if you do give radiotherapy to a young person they are at risk of getting a secondary cancer 20 years later within the radiation field
2839799 the outlook isnt always grim just about all patients have a chance of being cured
2839800 about 80 per cent of our patients will be alive five years after diagnosis but that does not translate to them all being cured
2839801 with lymphomas if it has not come back in five years then you are going to be cured leukaemia can come back late so can brain tumours but with every day that passes the risk of a cancer returning becomes less and less until the risk is negligible and then you can talk about a cure
2839802 its very difficult to see with the treatments we already have available how things are going to be significantly improved in the next ten years
2839803 what we are really trying to do is maintain high rates of survival and decrease the long term effects
2839804 until we find some way of turning the cancer off perhaps genetically we are not going to cure that many more patients
2839805 for the families it is a massive shock to find out a child has cancer they almost go through a grieving process
2839806 but the important message we can put out there now is that it is not a death sentence
2839807 having gone through cancer children and young people can face all sorts of other difficulties
2839808 they can have trouble getting insurance they will often have had gaps in their education because of their treatment affecting their university and employment prospects they can also have problems with anxiety constantly worrying that every ache or pain they get could be the cancer returning
2839809 it is difficult for teenagers to be treated alongside much younger children and also with much older patients
2839810 we want to make them feel more comfortable providing computers so they can do school work and try to carry on as normally as they can
2839811 survivors of childhood cancer must be given information and support about the possible late effects of their treatment including fertility issues and if these do arise they must get rapid access to specialist services
2839812 the treatment he received was fantastic and we always had faith that the care he was getting was the best he could have we are just very grateful
2839813 hes getting his energy back and is almost back to full fitness it has been great to see him getting back to his old self
2839814 i suppose it felt like your world had fallen apart
2839815 you see these things on tv but you think its never going to happen to you we were in shock and then went through lots of emotions
2839816 he was very little and initially he was in a lot of pain
2839817 he needed morphine and in some respects he didnt realise what he had or the implications
2839818 hes past the five years of treatment we were given the all clear in april 2006
2839819 to start with my mum did not want me to know about it when they thought something might be wrong in the end it was the doctor who told me what it was i just asked her what was the percentage chance of me living and she said it was 50 50
2839820 the doctor went through what my treatment would be i had to have radiotherapy every day for six weeks i also had chemotherapy i had to stay in hospital for a week every three weeks the treatment was really hard and it made me feel quite unwell
2839821 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2839822 i dont think we have to worry about invisible people walking around any time soon we are just at the beginning of doing anything like that
2839823 in naturally occurring material the index of refraction a measure of how light bends in a medium is positive
2839824 when you see a fish in the water the fish will appear to be in front of the position it really is or if you put a stick in the water the stick seems to bend away from you
2839825 instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water it would actually appear to be above the waters surface
2839826 i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this armed conflict
2839827 john mccain is going to be saying i know what i am talking about foreign policy and im tough enough to lead
2839828 barack obama is going to be saying i know what i am talking about in foreign policy and im nuanced enough that i am not going shooting from the hip the way john mccain does
2839829 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2839830 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2839831 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2839832 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2839833 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2839834 is a large amount of money but it is a modest fraction of our nations wealth
2839835 benchmark as a rough floor of how much we should spend on defense
2839836 that is what gates believes to be a reasonable price to stay free and protect our interests around the world
2839837 commit a minimum of four percent of the nations gross domestic product to the base defense budget
2839838 that american leadership is good both for america and for the world and that such leadership requires military strength diplomatic energy and commitment to moral principle
2839839 such a reaganite policy of military strength and moral clarity may not be fashionable today 1997
2839840 it is necessary if the united states is to build on the successes of this past century and to ensure our security and our greatness in the next
2839841 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2839842 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2839843 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2839844 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor
2839845 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2839846 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2839847 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2839848 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the whack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2839849 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
2839850 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of cheques with our show making fun of christians

2839865 hoe staat u tegenover de digitale revolutie het is toch een hele andere manier van fotograferen stevens je hebt tegenwoordig van die fotografen die met hun digitale camera continu vijf beelden per seconde schieten dan is de kans inderdaad groot dat je een straffe gebeurtenis op de gevoelige plaat vastlegt maar het is gewoon een slechte manier van fotograferen ik betrap mezelf er trouwens ook op dat ik betere fotos maak wanneer ik werk met film
2839866 hoe staat u tegenover de digitale revolutie het is toch een hele andere manier van fotograferen

2839868 the goal of my myp personal project is to provide not only an educational opportunity for myself and those involved in recording and my students but to show to the next generation of musicians that no matter what challenge and difficulty in life including that which our future professions will inevitably face can be overcome with determination and a passionate love for what one does as such i change the title of my compostition from requiem mass in a minor to cantata fantasique the fantasy cantata and intend to additionally provide audio samples of my work as well as computer generated audio and score using the fruits of the proceeds of my private instruction in the process i will learn the time management skills necessary for any adult artist and how to make extra income on the side while supporting a dream and still donating to the organizations i support when and if i am able to sell my project a vast majority portion of the profits will go to a charity for young aspiring musicians and the acda fmea or similar organizatioins deticated to the musical enrichment of todays youth
2839869 weve got something special and were going to sell it to you in a big ass box full of cool ass shit that you wont be able to get anywhere else
2839870 human minds are turing complete machines so any other type of mind will have similar capabilities to our own

2839872 the households that will have the greatest problem coping with higher transport and housing costs are among those with the least resources and weakest access to local infrastructure
2839873 its time to put a stop to all the crime you cant sleep at night because people are shooting and you want to know where the bullet is going to go next
2839874 to curtail some of the general mayhem weve been experiencing particularly the gun shots
2839875 nobody can walk down the street and be safe that is be free from police interference
2839876 they know exactly whos doing the shooting the robbery but it seems like were never going to get any justice around here
2839877 we got kids down here they should lock up these young folks that have been doing the shooting dont put us hostage or on lockdown
2839878 weve taken some drugs off people a couple of guns off people
2839879 they discovered the day before yesterday that hes got a hole in his lung and its getting air inside of his skin he wasnt cleared to box until 8 oclock last night so it has just been a series of things
2839880 its a hole in the lung where air seeps out and gets trapped in the skin they gave him some medication and rest he had to lay around for like two days he got the weight down last night he did the best he could i really dont think he couldve done any better
2839881 he also had whats called subcutaneous emphysema in the neck it means that there is air under the skin
2839882 occurs when air gets into tissues under the skin covering the chest wall or neck this can happen due to stabbing gun shot wounds other penetrations or blunt trauma air can also be found in between skin layers on the arms and legs during certain infections including gas gangrene
2839883 most of the conditions associated with subcutaneous emphysema are very severe and require hospitalization
2839884 i think what we saw in there was a young man with a grown man
2839885 it didnt go how i planned it to go but it was a good experience for me
2839886 it was pretty good for my first fight but i was a little rusty
2839887 i knew hed be tough i fought him before in the world championships
2839888 look for the crowd of people with ron paul shirts etc
