8890022 this year it is actually worse i have been here 54 years and i have never seen the water so low the situation so bad
8890023 i dont think the outside world realises just how dangerous the situation is not just for israel but for the whole region
8890024 there is a very real danger that this could lead to over salination the lower red line indicates the level at which the sustainability of the lake is threatened we are certainly very alarmed by the authorities willingness to go to the black line this development could well be irreversible
8890025 our cousins i say that because the bible says we are cousins have been drilling in areas they should not and this is diverting the water this is the politics of the middle east
8890026 they should be setting up manydesalination plants to get water from other sources theyre using israeli expertise in these matters all over the world but this is the one country which isnt using it enough i dont think it would be possible to deprive the farmers of their water so what is needed is alternative sources its that simple
8890027 quite big cracks are now appearing on the walls of our home that is due to the heat caused by the drought this is the hottest i can remember we desperately need some rain pretty soon maybe this is global warming

8890029 we used to say even a few years ago that one place where you couldnt go wrong fishing was kinneret hebrew name for the sea of galilee but now it is getting very very hard because the stocks are so low many fishermen fear for their livelihood and so do i but it seems no one really cares about us
8890030 of course many of the disciples of jesus were fishermen at galilee if you recall he said he would make them fishers of men well that wouldnt be possible now there are hardly any fish left around here

8890032 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8890033 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8890034 for 18 long months you have stood up one by one and said enough to the politics of the past you understand that in this election the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result you have shown what history teaches us that at defining moments like this one the change we need doesnt come from washington change comes to washington change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time

8890038 this is ludicrous why spend their time laying siege on a building in harare they should follow their own advice and concentrate on nation building we are all zimbabweans and that disgraceful display reflects badly on the whole nation those responsible should apologise to the voters of this country and fully explain their actions to the nation if necessary we will invade parliament to ensure that they come to their senses and start pulling in the same direction with everyone else for the sake of the country
8890039 the same thing happened in 2000 the mdc must realise that people elected them to represent them in parliament and ensure that their grievances are attended to they should behave professionally and create an atmosphere that is conducive for dialogue to start things moving in parliament
8890040 it was a painful experience to watch our president your president being subjected to that kind of treatment and harassment by the mdc and its supporters
8890041 they know what we are capable of doing and they should not cry foul when we deliver that blow as symbolized by the fist which is the partys symbol i cannot speak more about the things that will be done
8890042 if the president was here he would have told us what will be done and how it should be
8890043 we thank you for having been at parliament on tuesday to support your leadership
8890044 if you were not there it was going to be a bad day in the office for the president because of the behaviour of those mdc hooligans
8890045 we were pained by the way they treated the party the president and the entire leadership of this country this should never happen again what we are working on now is a strategy that can see us revenging for that episode
8890046 we have to reach a solution i hope the sadc facilitator will as a matter of urgency reconvene talks
8890047 they are being very rough and unreasonable they are threatening us with arrest and saying that our gathering is illegal

8890099 los instrumentos aztecas como los silbatos con forma de calavera poseen caracter sticas de construcci n que no se encuentran en ning n otro instrumento musical conocido
8890100 este sonido se produce a diferencia de los instrumentos tradicionales cuando dentro de las flautas se chocan dos corrientes de aire diametralmente opuestas dentro de lo que he llamado una c mara del caos

8890113 whenever youre restarting growth what i can tell you is its an imprecise process there were some parts of the business where we were probably too aggressive
8890114 it is going to cost a lot of money to expand their business

8890120 this is what weve been waiting to hear because those numbers have been going down for quite some time
8890121 an interesting contradiction is that in 2000 we ranked 15th oldest in the nation but we now are at 30th
8890122 there is not much you can do about it short of tying them up
8890123 our data seems to point toward the inherent decision that is made when the tumor is formed whether it is highly malignant or not moreover since the characteristic might be dependent on the normal cell status one might imagine that they might be different between individuals
8890124 this does suggest that cells can sit for a long time then be activated
8890125 but these cells were injected into the circulation normal breast cells are not supposed to be in the circulation
8890126 cells that did not have any oncogenes in them and do not transform spontaneously as per all published studies we could see little colonies of these cells when we inspected the lungs
8890127 at no point never did we see a solid vision that would resemble metastatic colonies but it appears that every time we looked at the animal the colonies appeared to be larger

8890146 it is a big challenge to win the competition any season but the way this teams set up and the players we have means were so unpredictable in the way we attack
8890147 for me looking on last season that was the main difference we had so many players who could change games
8890148 we have a young squad and theres no reason why we cant do it winning the league and champions league puts us into competitions like this and we have much to look forward to
8890149 our intention is always to win and to do that we have to go out and perform as a team
8890150 weve done it over the last two seasons consistently and we now have to do it this year if we continue to perform theres no reason why we cant be successful
8890151 i have looked into the eyes of my players to make sure they have retained the hunger you need to succeed
8890152 i am satisfied they are ready to go again we cannot afford to slacken the premier league has never been so competitive and the records show it is difficult to defend the champions league
8890153 im not reading too much into glenavons form so far they have added good players to their squad like tony grant and trevor molloy and it will be a very difficult game for us
8890154 but we are no different than the other teams in the sense that that we want to make our home ground a fortress and pick up as many points as we can at the showgrounds
8890155 we want teams to arrive here fearing what could happen this weeks results told me what i already know this will be a very tough league for all the teams and victories will be hard earned
8890156 i still believe the top three or four clubs will pull away from the rest but in this early stage of the league teams are finding their feet and capable of beating each other
8890157 it will be a very exciting season and i am looking forward to each test

8890174 wir gehen f r das gesamtjahr 2008 von einem umsatzwachstum von 35 bis 40 aus
8890175 wir haben bereits jetzt f r das jahr 2009 auftr ge im wert von von 106 mio eur fixiert
8890176 i was giving a team talk earlier in the season and told the players what a privilege it is to sign an international
8890177 its not too many teams that have proper international footballers on their books and to get peter kennedy as a player im delighted to get him as a person im delighted to get his experience im delighted
8890178 i think hell be the glue that will knit and link us together because i want him to play in the middle of the park i see four people playing for two places we are blessed that we have a 2 to 1 ratio in almost all places and i feel there is good quality competition
8890179 we have four quality centre backs albert watson gary haveron and gavin mcdonnell and archie aaron stewart
8890180 we have four central midfielders and theres a nice mix in there
8890181 up front we have neil teggart kevin kelbie davitt walsh and michael ward they are the four principle strikers so its getting the pairing right look at our left side we have mcclean hogan mullan king and cushley and king can play down the right
8890182 wee picky mark picking whos jinky on the right and we have michael mcginlay whos more pace power and purpose and doesnt need to beat you to get a cross in so all over its good
8890183 its a big game for both teams and im looking forward to it
8890184 we know we havent been playing well but we have shown that we are a good team and it wont take long for us to find that form again
8890185 as far as we are concerned things can only get better and i see no reason why that cant start immediately
8890186 we have got cliftonville tomorrow if we were to get a win against them it would be a massive boost for us and i think that people would then forget about the last two matches
8890187 we had a lot of very hard matches against cliftonville last season so we know what we are up against
8890188 they like us probably havent hit form just yet but they have strengthened since last year too and i know that they will give us another very hard game
8890189 they are always up for it when they come to the oval and this will be no different especially seeing as they are coming off the back of a defeat on tuesday night against distillery
8890190 we are conceding goals from cross balls and set pieces which is disappointing from our point of view because it is something that we feel we are strong at
8890191 we are working on it and well keep working on it but i wouldnt get too carried away
8890192 perhaps it is a bit of a confidence thing but that is something that can be easily sorted out
8890193 as a defender you want clean sheets roy coyle always said it was clean sheets that win championships and i feel if we get one then we will settle and go on a run where we dont concede
8890194 we have had problems with this referee in the past and now we have problems with him again
8890195 i raised concerns about stephen weatheralls appointment to our game against lisburn distillery on tuesday night when i first found out he was the referee but that fell on deaf ears
8890196 it is a while since stephen refereed one of our games and then we had him for the county antrim shield match against brantwood the league game at distillery and then he was due to be fourth official for saturdays match against glentoran
8890197 i know that he has now been taken off that game but we feel that we have been left with no alternative but to make an official complaint to the ifa
8890198 his handling of the match and some of the decisions he made left a lot to be desired
8890199 in a climate where referees have brought themselves into the public eye we need a better standard of officiating
8890200 we have incidences like our captain chris scannell asking the referee to consult his linesman over a decision and being yellow carded for it and there were other things as well
8890201 people are going to say that its sour grapes on our part because we lost the game 3 1 but thats not the issue
8890202 lisburn distillery deserved to win the game they deserve a lot of credit and paul kirk has put together a very good team
8890203 the problem was with the referee we thought we had moved on from things that happened last year but we are just back to the way we were
8890204 we arent doing this because we lost one game we are doing it for the good of football because we want better officiating than what we have at present
8890205 we have supporters who part with their hard earned cash to follow our team people who give up their time and work hard for the club and if we keep getting poor refereeing displays they will stop coming to games
8890206 we have a new league with marketing campaigns to bring more people into grounds and still we have the same referees and the same performances
8890207 obviously the players were disappointed to have conceded so late on in the cobh game when it looked as though we won the game
8890208 but on the up side we have taken four points out of six from the last two games
8890209 the fact that we have this big derby game against derry tonight means that the players have to put that behind them very quickly
8890210 theres nothing like a local derby for getting players motivated and theyll be well up for this one
8890211 derry are on the crest of a wave and we know its going to difficult game we also know that derry have already beaten us this season but we played quite well in that game
8890212 harps have a strong squad and we cant afford to be complacent were still an emerging team and so we have to improve every week and thats the way we view this
8890213 were still two points behind cork in the european places so we have to try and stay in touch with them for when we go down there next week and we need to beat finn harps in order to do that
8890214 we have scored a lot of goals in recent weeks and thats a good sign the players are playing with confidence and expressing themselves and we want that to continue this
8890215 we are struggling to get a team there was a mass exodus last season we lost six or seven of the backline and a few in the pack
8890216 well not have our new signings for five or six weeks but it gives us the opportunity to look at other guys
8890217 i was brought up to train with the first team about a year ago and it has really helped me improve my game
8890218 when you are marking peter thompson and glenn ferguson in training it is only going to help you get better and it has been really good for me
8890219 i have been waiting for my chance in the first team since last year after playing against glenavon in the cis cup and i came on against glentoran in the setanta cup at the oval
8890220 i cant really blame the manager for not giving me a chance before because of the way william murphy and noel bailie have been playing
8890221 they are quality players and have been quality players for years
8890222 people ask questions about how long they can go on for but winkie murphy is still one of the fittest players at the club and seems to be fitter this year than he has been before
8890223 getting in ahead of either of those two is going to be hard
8890224 i have been lucky to get my chance and it is usually through injuries that players get into a team
8890225 i got in because steven douglas was out and conor hagan got injured and i knew i had to do well to stay in the team
8890226 hopefully i can keep playing well and keep my place but i know how hard it is to do that
8890227 there are a couple of players who will be trying to get in ahead of me but that is all good for the team
8890228 if i score a couple more goals then maybe that will help me keep my place i will just have to wait and see what happens
8890229 we let ourselves down with the ball at lisburn they were difficult conditions and 180 was above par
8890230 im not making excuses because we can win without ryan and peter but we were without our best batsman and best bowler
8890231 that will not be easy either but when we are at full strength we are still a formidable outfit
8890232 weve had a great start four points from glentoran and cliftonville is brilliant and it could have been six had we not conceded late against the glens
8890233 now we have to put in the same kind of performance against newry
8890234 thats not going to be easy either gerry flynn has put together a good team there a young team with a lot of experience in it too and they have done ok this season as well
8890235 we just have to carry on with what we have been doing its been a great start for us and for the league as a whole
8890236 in the past you could have picked the top four but now

8890242 to our knowledge this is the first report of a direct association between childhood abuse and asthma and asthma related outcomes
8890243 we wanted to explore whether exposure to stress and violence is associated with an increased risk of asthma in urban children living in puerto rico
8890244 we already know that there is a high prevalence of asthma in puerto rican children and many studies have linked stress and exposure to violence to health problems in childhood including asthma
8890245 children with a history of abuse had higher frequencies of all outcomes of interest than those without a history of abuse
8890246 after adjusting for relevant covariates history of abuse was associated with an approximate doubling of the odds of current asthma healthcare use for asthma and allergic rhinitis
8890247 it is not simply the exposure to a particular stressor but the physiological response to that stressor that predicts physical health outcomes
8890248 latino culture places an emphasis on certain values and social supports that may buffer the effects of poverty and community violence experienced by children in puerto rico
8890249 this is a community wide effort from many individuals in many different countries who have made this happen
8890250 smoking during pregnancy is a double edged sword with respect to sids
8890251 not only does it raise a mothers likelihood of having a preterm baby who is already among the most vulnerable to sids but it increases the infants susceptibility to sids even further
8890252 preterm babies are known to have increased breathing difficulties in proportion to their prematurity and cigarette smoke is known to increase apneas in full term babies
8890253 but until now cigarette smoke exposure and preterm birth have not been investigated together with respect to their potential effects on respiratory dysfunction
8890254 our study shows that preterm infants make incomplete and or delayed recovery from interruptions in breathing
8890255 this has clear implications for their risk of sids but there is even still another reason for concern even after the risk of sids has passed inability or delayed recovery from repeated low oxygen episodes can also be detrimental to brain development there is increasing evidence that infants exposed to prenatal cigarette smoke are at high risk for developmental and behavioral disorders
8890256 we were disappointed not to find a smoking gun that would explain the common association between obesity and asthma
8890257 however this research points us to other possibilities that future research should examine
8890258 we hypothesized that the low grade systemic inflammation present in obesity would augment the inflammation of asthma a synergistic effect
8890259 or alternatively that the inflammation of obesity might affect the airways independently an additive effect perhaps resulting in mixed airway inflammation
8890260 what we found was that although inflammatory cells and other biomarkers of inflammation were increased there was no significant interaction demonstrated between obesity and asthma
8890261 this does not change the fact that there is a well established link between asthma and obesity sometimes a negative result is important and the results add to our body of knowledge regarding the obesity asthma link now we need to look in other directions for the answers
8890262 we did not look at this in our patients given that asthma is immunologically driven this is a potential avenue for further research
8890263 alternatively it may be that dynamic changes in lung function that occur with episodes of asthma are different with excess body weight
8890264 if present at all was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
8890265 while such a reduction in all cause mortality would have been impressive these mortality benefits are likely implausible previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated a healthy user benefit or frailty bias
8890266 over the last two decades in the united sates even while vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality further only about 10 percent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 percent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion
8890267 the healthy user effect is seen in what doctors often refer to as their good patients patients who are well informed about their health who exercise regularly do not smoke or have quit drink only in moderation watch what they eat come in regularly for health maintenance visits and disease screenings take their medications exactly as prescribed and quite religiously get vaccinated each year so as to stay healthy such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
8890268 but you also need to take care of yourself everyone can reduce their risk by taking simple precautions
8890269 wash your hands avoid sick kids and hospitals during flu season consider antiviral agents for prophylaxis and tell your doctor as soon as you feel unwell because there is still a chance to decrease symptoms and prevent hospitalization if you get sick because flu vaccine is not as effective as people have been thinking it is

8890334 we were just unlucky to concede two tries in the opening minutes the idea was to contain namibia for the first 20 minutes
8890335 i am not disappointed the competition has been close and we are still within our aim of improving on our sixth position from the last tournament which means we must beat cote divoire in the play off
8890336 all of them have stood out so there will be no need for me to name any player here it was never a one man show but team work
8890337 from what happened at the olympic games you will see that the players have proven that they can play at the highest level and they do not need to prove anything to any one
8890338 if any of them is given the chance i think that person may not disappoint but they must take it easy
8890339 its not like the bus that we gave them was bad because it was one of the new ones from zupco which is a good coach but they said they wanted a better one
8890340 when we were in egypt i was made to sign an undertaking that we would only house them at the rainbow towers which they still call the sheraton and that is what we have done
8890341 its true that they also wanted a limousine for their head of delegation but we have come to some sort of agreement on that issue
8890342 they have got good organisation and they are very quick and so we must respect them if we are to win this game
8890343 we will try and play our normal game the pressure is on them because with seven points i feel we are in a very comfortable position
8890344 a win will take us to 10 points and we will qualify they dynamos know that if they lose or draw they are finished
8890345 its a very big challenge for us to win our philosophy is playing to win and we will try and do our best
8890346 we want to top the group and we have to win to achieve that if we pick up a point its still good for us
8890347 the artificial turf is a big problem for us the players struggled when we went to asec and we will try and do our best
8890348 but we know it could be very difficult because dynamos are a very good side
8890349 there have been a lot of disturbing scenes at dynamos in the past weeks but i would like to urge the warring parties to set aside their differences and unite
8890350 we cant be having these squabbles in modern football and for the sake of the players who have families to feed and a nation to cheer lets have peace and support them during this big game
8890351 this is also just not about dynamos its about the country and a win against al ahly will definitely bring a lot of pride to every zimbabwean
8890352 we are urging all supporters to come in their numbers and turn rufaro into hell for al ahly
8890353 only unity will help us achieve our goals lets give peace a chance and support our team
8890354 after the disappointment that came with that loss at the hands of our rivals caps united only a win against the best team in africa can help cheer the spirits of the fans once again
8890355 the coach faces a lot of challenges with injured players and those that have not been coming to training but we are there for him and his boys and we should turn rufaro into a place where even the mighty al ahly will wilt
8890356 the match was evenly balanced and both teams had chances but we used our chance and scored
8890357 its still a long way to go and the cbz fa cup is still in its early stages and we just need to keep on doing well
8890358 we failed to convert our chances but complacency has crept into the boys and they felt they would just beat this team
8890359 we did not field our first team and the boys didnt play our normal game
8890360 it is the clubs that offer them referees bribes to influence officiating in their favour okay how many club managers have come out in the open to admit that a particular referee demanded bribe from him to favour his team
8890361 we are going to implement the recommendations of the committee to the letter allegations of corruption in the league have been giving our football a very bad image and a dent on our attempts to match up with what obtains in developed leagues around the world

8890373 every young athlete aspires to one day see their face on the cover of the wheaties box
8890374 its been a huge inspiration to see great gymnastics champions on the box like mary lou and carly plus the magnificent seven from 1996 its a privilege and an honor for me to be on the box and im very excited to be part of the wheaties tradition
8890375 i tell young athletes all the time that if you want to become a champion you need to stay focused train hard and pay attention to what you eat
8890376 im so thrilled for all of our athletes but in particular to see nastia take the gold in the all around and now get her own wheaties box
8890377 wheaties is arguably the first and still one of the foremost brand images in all of sports its an honor for any athlete to be on the box and more than anything it epitomizes what it means to be a true champion
8890378 having your picture on the wheaties box is something all athletes strive for
8890379 its a mark of distinction that says youve reached the pinnacle of your career this is a very special honor for me
8890380 eating right helps give you the edge to withstand extensive workouts provide quick muscle recovery and guard against injury
8890381 bryans performance in beijing is certainly worthy of the wheaties box
8890382 hes a great athlete and a great competitor im proud to welcome both bryan and nastia into the breakfast of champions family
8890383 there were many outstanding performances by american athletes over the past few weeks and we applaud them for their efforts
8890384 both nastia and bryan bring such dedication and commitment to their sports and were so happy to welcome them both into the wheaties family theyre both terrific role models and represent the very best of the championship ideals that have made wheaties the breakfast of champions for more than 80 years
8890385 the us authorities will be rubbing its hands together in glee at the news that they are finally going to get their hands on mckinnon they have sent a clear message that they are set on hunting down anyone who attempts to breach their computer systems and compromise their data gary mckinnon is now facing the uncomfortable prospect of an american trial
8890386 mckinnon has had tremendous support from the hacker community and even ordinary people throughout the duration of his trials but this decision will still hit hard even after the many years of appeals the message is clear if you hack into computers you have to realise that the legal consequences could be severe others should take note of mckinnons predicament and ask themselves do i want to end up in his situation id imagine the answer across the board would be a resounding no
8890387 the internet has provided immeasurable benefits to us all however like many good things there are deviants who want to misuse the internet and social networking sites to harm others
8890388 it is our job to do whatever we can to deter destructive behavior and the potentially tragic consequences that harm our children the legislation i signed protecting missourians from cyber stalking is a big step in the right direction
8890389 a security freeze is the best way for consumers to protect their credit records from identity thieves
8890390 we expect more consumers will take advantage of security freeze protection as it becomes easier to use
8890391 consumers across the country deserve the same easy ability to use the freeze to keep crooks out of their credit files and to lift it quickly when theyre applying for new credit
8890392 the credit bureaus should make it just as convenient for consumers in all 50 states to use the security freeze to protect themselves from identity thieves

8890397 with lunarquest were looking at whether we can build games consistent with learning science
8890398 our goal is to help kids be engaged in science
8890399 if this can help motivate them and help them apply what theyd learned it can support whats going on in the classroom
8890400 the exposure from the dell ad has been really exciting it was completely out of the blue and happened really fast the agency that created the spot mother new york found my song via an internet search got in touch with me and a week later the ad was on the air
8890401 everyone hoped that 2007 was a significant period of growth that would be sustained but perhaps we didnt realise just how miserable the summer was going to be weather wise
8890402 it is the lower end that is seeing the biggest drop the tourists that visit a place and stay in a limited service hotel are probably the first to be affected by the credit crunch the business traveller or those staying in a higher standard of hotel will tend to have the money to do so
8890403 guys coming for a stag weekend will probably think about staying at home
8890404 weve obviously had a miserable period of weather and there appears to be a decline in ticket volumes at the fringe so it seems likely there will be a continuation it is turning out to be the more difficult year we expected when the first effects of the credit crunch were being seen
8890405 edinburgh has a higher base to fall so that can make the drop sharper it also has more of a reliance on the corporate and banking sectors and people are drawing costs in
8890406 some holiday business from the united states and japan in particular is down but there are big companies here like rbs and hbos and both have been hit by the credit crunch and they will both be cutting costs
8890407 this 313 000 investment will replace more than two kilometres of ageing unreliable water mains in this part of edinburgh
8890408 work will be carried out away from the city centre to meet the needs of the city and its visitors
8890409 our contractor will use a blend of traditional and more modern techniques to update this section of our water infrastructure in difficult areas the open cut method will be used digging down and replacing each part of the pipeline stretch by stretch
8890410 however for the majority of the project we will use slip lining and pipe bursting this is where we dig down at intervals of a hundred yards or so and slide new durable plastic pipelines inside the old main either slipping them into place or bursting the original pipe as the names suggest
8890411 there is an incredible warmth for the building and what it has delivered for generations of people
8890412 there is a genuine will to see the kings restored to its former glory
8890413 these are exciting times for the kings theatre the council is in the process of setting up a joint project board to drive the development forward and we look forward to working with the fctt
8890414 given the significant role the kings plays during the festival and during the rest of the year we hope to be able to add to our 6m investment through external funders to take the renovations even further
8890415 our proposals for getting to grips with alcohol misuse have sparked a lively debate across scottish society
8890416 this government has taken the bull by the horns and put forward radical measures to re balance scotlands relationship with alcohol because we dont want to see future generations suffer
8890417 we believe its time for action but we want the scottish people to understand where were coming from and tell us what they think thats why i want to encourage people in edinburgh and the lothians to respond to the consultation before it closes on september 9
8890418 if someone is queuing up at the post office every week to get their benefits it implies they dont have a bank account and the same goes for bill payments
8890419 when you are going to cause a great deal of inconvenience and difficulty to the people who are the most vulnerable in society you need to think again
8890420 the very least they should do is organise some alternative facility even once a week would help
8890421 ive got emphysema and spondilitis and i have to use a walking frame
8890422 all these people are going to be descending on bonnyrigg is it going to be like wimbledon with us having to camp out in tents in the queue
8890423 further cuts to the network risk leaving many vulnerable older people socially isolated and struggling to access essential services
8890424 a lot of people use the post office to get their pension and benefits not just because its close but because its a social hub and they meet a lot of friends there
8890425 the uk government has made it quite clear we need to return the post office network back into profit and they have already made the decision that 2500 post offices across the uk have to close
8890426 post office ltd is following strict access criteria laid down by the uk government where in urban areas 99 per cent of the population should be within a mile of a post office
8890427 part of the consultation which is currently running for six weeks is to hear from customers on any issues they may have on how they will be disadvantaged in accessing alternative services
8890428 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8890429 choosing a school is very important for parents and their children when places cannot be granted at the chosen school the parent has the right of appeal
8890430 it is important that the committee has a balanced membership and parent members have an important role to play and bring a perspective which is different to that of the other two types of members
8890431 we are looking to recruit parents of children of school age the only criteria for applying is that the person must be a parent of a child of school age in education at a west lothian school
8890432 this takes no account of the residents wishes there are no good reasons for any trees to be removed in the grassmarket
8890433 poplars are not considered the tree of choice by many arboricultural experts but the people who live here like these trees and want to keep them they give the grassmarket character and should be left alone
8890434 there is a very vocal minority of people who do not want to see the trees replaced it can be a very emotive issue and people do get very attached to the trees
8890435 the problem is no one can say how much life the trees have in them they could go tomorrow or they could last another 20 years the expert opinion is they probably dont have a long time left
8890436 its a very hard decision there are potential safety issues there is money in the kitty at the moment to pay for the project but there may not be in a few years time
8890437 most of us are quite happy about it we realise its better to replace the trees now this way it will cost 6000 a piece whereas it could cost 18 000 if we wait for ten years
8890438 the trees put in in april have already grown several feet now
8890439 our biologists and independent tree surgeons have looked at the trees and found that internally they are in a state of decay theyre not going to last more than a few years and will need to be replaced anyway
8890440 the new ones will be mature trees although they will not be exactly the same
8890441 we had a chat and she said we completely understand what you are saying
8890442 the good thing is they are keen to speak to me and ask for advice in terms of facilities and making things better for sport in scotland
8890443 the idea of representing a scottish team in the olympics is not ridiculous but at the moment they cant look at the results achieved by scottish athletes and say oh scotland won these medals alone
8890444 we couldnt have done it without the support the british set up gave us
8890445 in the future if they are serious about it and serious to push scotland forward as an independent sporting nation then it is going to take a long time and a lot of investment
8890446 we were contacted by the radisson when he turned up there and we advised them to give him the rooms
8890447 it was then just a matter of picking him at the hotel because we had been alerted so early
8890448 checkin is proving a big success since it was launched in april as an early warning system
8890449 hes ashamed of himself and accepts that he has a drink problem
8890450 the partial closure of the roundabout and the favourable weather over the last two weekends has allowed a huge amount of resurfacing work to be progressed safely and efficiently
8890451 we are pleased that the third weekend closure will not be required and the works remain on programme for completion by the middle of september
8890452 this is a significant investment for the local community not just for older people but people of all ages in midlothian
8890453 this new hospital is another example of our commitment to deliver services more locally it will also deliver a range of services not currently available in midlothian
8890454 this is excellent news that i know the people of midlothian will welcome
8890455 we had to close the salon for most of day turning away customers while repairs were made and everything was cleared
8890456 usually there is absolutely nothing in the shop the till cant be seen from the window
8890457 we are committed to a greater visible police presence deterring crime and reassuring our citizens this welcome increase in the number of officers is in part the result of our direct recruitment of new officers over and above the recruitment plans of our police forces
8890458 we have set out plans to deliver a more visible policing presence on scotlands streets and make an additional 1000 officers available in our communities
8890459 we are not just delivering on this but going substantially beyond by also looking at recruitment retention and redeployment
8890460 last year as we promised 150 officers were recruited and paid for by the scottish government and are currently working in scotlands communities
8890461 this year we are directly funding the recruitment of another 450 over and above forces previous plans
8890462 we inherited the lowest recruitment since devolution with many officers due to retire weve tackled that challenge head on and although these latest figures are reassuring there remains much work to be done but we are confident the resources and policies now in place will deliver improved policing for scotland
8890463 we believe that the department for work and pensions should support adults who become carers during their working lives to combine work and care and enable those who wish to return to work when caring ends to do so
8890464 you dont really direct the fringe you just cling on to it and hope to be there at the end
8890465 i dont think we can afford to wait for a new director to be in place i would ideally like to see decisions being made about the box office before christmas and i would be surprised if we had a new director in place by then
8890466 everyone is agreed that this is one of the top priorities for the fringe we have to run a central box office and we have to get it right
8890467 the fringe office has been very self serving in recent years and i do not think it has engaged with the venues in the way it needs to
8890468 there are serious issues that need to be addressed chiefly financial the cost to the performer is going up the cost to the public is going up and yet these costs are not been met with increased revenue
8890469 from my perspective the main problem was the lack of communication the fringe is all about collaboration and open discussion but jon chose to be a more distant figure than his predecessors not returning calls and refusing to engage
8890470 the new director will have to be a real leader in order to take it forward
8890471 the cost of putting a show into the programme is one area they could look at bringing down
8890472 the council needs to start putting proper funding into the fringe in order to make this happen it brings in 75 million a year to the local economy and investing in it would make sound business sense as it could enable it to grow and bring in 80m or 90m a year
8890473 the role of director is not a creative role and they do not need a creative person they need to be a brilliant administrator and someone who can engage with the local council
8890474 like most of the festival it could no doubt make a case for more funding
8890475 all of the cities festivals have an international reputation that is the envy of the world and we want to help them go from strength to strength if that means we need review our funding then there is nothing to stop us doing that
8890476 there have been a lot of issues for the fringe to deal with this year not just the box office there has also been the impact of the weather and the olympic games and all of that needs to be taken into account
8890477 given all that i dont think it has been too bad a year for the fringe and i dont think it needs to change too much the fringe itself needs to beware of becoming too bureaucratic what makes it so special is that anarchic quality which means you are never sure what you are going to get
8890478 although the proposal contains some technical shortfalls these are acceptable in the context of maintaining and rebuilding the historic urban grain and finding a new use for the building
8890479 this is a missed opportunity as far as im concerned
8890480 what we need in leith are things to keep people here and make them want to come in the first place
8890481 the main source of income in future years for this area will be tourism with all the big liners coming in but this building is the golden egg and we risk throwing that away
8890482 pc cockburns first aid expertise almost certainly saved this mans life to all intents and purposes the man was dead when pc cockburn first saw him
8890483 they were approached by a car driven by a man whose father was unconscious in the passenger seat
8890484 the man was immediately removed from the car and it was established that there were no vital signs
8890485 pc cockburn carried out mouth to mouth resuscitation until the ambulance arrived
8890486 nhs lothian indicated that there is clinical evidence in the form of better clinical outcomes for patients for retaining the integrated colorectal surgery service at the western general hospital rather than moving it as planned to the royal infirmary of edinburgh
8890487 i understand that the boards decision was based on clinical advice that it would be beneficial to retain cancer related services together at the western general and also on the conclusion that medical staff rotas could be made compliant with the european working time directive
8890488 since it appears that retaining the integrated colorectal surgery service at the western general has no negative impact on patients and is justified by the clinical evidence i support the boards decision
8890489 i congratulate the health minister for putting clinical analysis before party political agendas retaining this service at the western will mean better patient care more lives saved and better use of nhs resources
8890490 to say we are disappointed at the decision is an understatement
8890491 the clinical delivery of this service is primary and we believe st johns should have been considered for that
8890492 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8890493 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8890494 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8890495 the problem is if they are not returned its not really working as an exchange and they end up in our streets and parks and if someone comes into contact with them they dont know what they could catch
8890496 it is a double edged sword because it is important that clean needles are being used but there has to be something in place to say to them if you dont give back all the needles we will only give you half as many next time
8890497 its important to protect both the drug user and the general public who shouldnt have to come across used needles
8890498 our needle exchange initiatives are provided by spittal street clinic community pharmacies and the needle exchange outreach network neon
8890499 neon has been extremely successful particularly in musselburgh where it has a 100 per cent return rate we actively encourage all patients to return needles in the boxes which we provide
8890500 last time it was a bit of a response to a financial crisis but this time they have looked at it very strongly in terms of educational benefit and good rationale
8890501 the reality is that pupil population moves around and we are often left with schools that are basically in the wrong place
8890502 if a school becomes too old fashioned and there are small pupil numbers then the youngsters in that school will not be getting as good an education provision as youngsters elsewhere
8890503 the council has looked at this very carefully and identified the schools against a set of criteria
8890504 once it was closed we went back and asked those who fiercely opposed closure and they said that in fact it was the right thing to do
8890505 i think theyre using sneaky tactics because they are clearly going to close more schools
8890506 i believe theyre doing it in phases so they dont cause a big outcry
8890507 they are doing a small amount at a time so were not going to get a united front like we did last year
8890508 they do seem to be trying to listen to local people probably trying to persuade people that this is in their interest which is something they should have done all along in some cases theres not many people left to fight for the schools
8890509 schools with very small rolls struggle to provide the kind of extracurricular activities that children need to help them flourish as they develop during these crucial early years
8890510 i understand the real attachment that parents feel towards a school that has been part of a community for a long time but the painful truth is that there has been a fall of nearly 6000 primary aged children over the last ten years in edinburgh
8890511 we also have the issue that within certain areas of the city the school rolls are very variable as parents vote with their feet when they choose a school for their child

8890515 this all supports our view that the ecb will eventually cut rates pretty aggressively although worries over the inflation outlook will keep the bank on hold for some months yet
8890516 richard snook economist at the center for economic and business research said hes looking for the european central bank to
8890517 we do not believe that the 25 basis point increase in interest rates in july will be reversed quickly
8890518 while we appreciate the efforts of these shareholders due to the dramatic increase in huntsmans net debt and decrease in its earnings since last july their proposal does not come close to making the combined company solvent
8890519 huntsmans shareholders lack this information because huntsman has despite our repeated requests for more than two months refused to permit its shareholders to review our delaware complaint and the duff amp phelps solvency analysis if this information were made public huntsman shareholders would understand that this proposal is inadequate
8890520 in the light of continuing weakness in the housing market and the wider economy we continue to expect arrears and repossessions to increase for the remainder of the year although we will be putting further resources into tackling the problem
8890521 in line operating performance and reconfirmation of full year guidance should reassure some investors who were concerned coming into the numbers that carrefour may warn on its profit outlook

8890523 the fact that nintendo is confident to say even before the end of the first half that overseas sales are this strong will likely help the stock ride a wave towards the christmas shopping season

8890527 deze wet is niet bedoeld om de verantwoordelijkheid voor het controleren van auteursrechten van derden af te schuiven op websites het gaat om de kwestie of veoh voldoende stappen heeft ondernomen om inbreuk op auteursrechten af te handelen
8890528 het is fantastisch te zien dat de rechtbank bevestigt dat de dmca diensten als youtube die zich aan de wet houden en het auteursrecht respecteren beschermd
8890529 i feel it will be in the interests of pakistan democracy and the pakistan peoples party that this office of president remains above controversy and i will humbly request mr zardari that he should withdraw his candidature in the supreme national interest and in interest of democratic stability
8890530 i do not want to comment on a persons mental health
8890531 but since he zardari is a public figure contesting a public office the office of supreme commander of the armed forces who has his hand on the nuclear trigger who is also chairman of the nuclear command authority it is legitimate for the people of pakistan to ask whether that story is true or not and what is his response
8890532 under the second phase of the programmes efforts will be made to reconstruct and repair embankments the turbulent kosi breached and charted out a new course and rehabilitate the flood hit people

8890545 while i was persuading mr welch not to concern himself in this disturbance i heard mrs hawkins cry out murder and walked away

8890549 a lot of things in the diary would not be seen as right for a victorian girl to mention it contained much bitterness and disappointment

8890551 i remember i used to half believe and wholly play with fairies when i was a child what heaven can be more real than to retain the spirit world of childhood tempered and balanced by knowledge and common sense to fear no longer the terror that flieth by night yet to feel truly and understand a little a very little of the story of life
8890552 an odd story of the 1964 election never published alec then prime minister was staying with john and priscilla tweedsmuir who had no room for alecs private bodyguard he went to the nearest town aberdeen and john amp priscilla left alec for a time alone in the house

8890558 it was meant to be in london but i said no
8890559 the struggle for now does not exist because a struggle is ideological and there is no ideological bent to the struggle we are seeing those who speak for us are no longer people like justice adolphus karibi whyte rtd vice president dr goodluck jonathan it is people like ateke tom that are our spokesmen does that mean that we have no graduates ateke tom does not know how to speak english so if our leaders are ateke and the rest and they speak on our behalf imagine the quality of the people that we have produced that is the indication
8890560 the first thing to say is that in baghad you know what the war is about dont you it is a religious war between the shiites and the sunnis in rivers state in bayelsa and other parts of the niger delta who is fighting who what is the war about what is the shooting about the kidnap cases that are taking place are against whom when you came into port harcourt you saw it as a graveyard this is not the old port harcourt that we use to have there are three principal economic centres in nigeria lagos abuja and port harcourt we are by ourselves killing our own economic centre in the comity of nations we cannot compete as we should because the nerve centre of our economic activities is beginning to disappear at the same time lagos is beginning to become the hub of oil activities in nigeria because we are on our asking lagos to assume the position of being the oil capital of nigeria and we call it militancy and i call it criminality
8890561 is this country fair to niger delta people have we been fairly treated as we look at the laws i have some of the law that i have some of the laws that i have indicated them which also you can find in the programme i wont dwell much on it because that is why we are here if you look at the national inland waterways act it has completely marginalized our people in such a manner that the act even makes it possible for the federal government to even control the creeks and i am told that by the military officers in rivers state that we have about 3 000 creeks in rivers state it means that the 3 000 creeks in rivers state all belong to the federal government the implication therefore is that even if the rivers man want to collect sand he has to go and get license from the federal government there is the territorial water act that one again implies before our people can go to the ocean to fish now you cannot it is again created for the rich for those who own trawlers from rivers state bayelsa state to go to the high sea fish and export and our people who use to go that way to fish can no longer fish we are marginalized in that regard
8890562 is as we are gathered here because the federal government is visiting us with injustice should we also visit ourselves with injustice should we we are we do and we are visiting ourselves with injustice and i can tell you how we are doing that
8890563 the first thing to say is that in baghad you know what the war is about dont you it is a religious war between the shiites and the sunnis in rivers state in bayelsa and other parts of the niger delta who is fighting who what is the war about what is the shooting about the kidnap cases that are taking place are against whom this is not the old port harcourt that we use to have there are three principal economic centres in nigeria lagos abuja and port harcourt we are by ourselves killing our own economic centre in the comity of nations we cannot compete as we should because the nerve centre of our economic activities is beginning to disappear at the same time lagos is beginning to become the hub of oil activities in nigeria because we are on our asking lagos to assume the position of being the oil capital of nigeria and we call it militancy and i call it criminality
8890564 to define criminality is that anybody who breaks the laws of the federal republic of nigeria is a criminal the law says we shall not bear arms and so anybody who bear arms have committed a crime and so they are all criminal who are the people being killed the niger delta people julius berger is moving out and they are moving out leaving behind 4 500 niger delta people who work with them those people will be thrown into the unemployment market michelin has left all their staff from the niger delta are all unemployed and the economy is grinding to a halt and we are saying the struggle
8890565 the struggle for now does not exist because a struggle is ideological and there is no ideological bent to the struggle we are seeing those who speak for us are no longer people like justice adolphus karibi whyte rtd vice president and dr goodluck jonathan it is people like ateke tom that are our spokesmen does that mean that we have no graduates ateke tom does not know how to speak english so if our leaders are ateke and the rest and they speak on our behalf imagine the quality of the people that we have produced that is the indication
8890566 we ask ourselves one basic question what are we voted here to do what is our responsibility
8890567 wanted to win positions and they started to accumulate weapons they began to groom these boys as protective measures to put themselves in office today they are now like the frankenstein monsters may be those politicians are afraid to come home the new homes are now abuja and lagos even our people are moving to abuja and lagos and those who are moving are not the poor the poor cannot afford houses in abuja and lagos i hope you know that it is the rich probably when i finish i move to abuja
8890568 we must demand from our leaders accountability they must account not for the funds alone they must account for what they have turned our children into they must tell us why the next mans life is not as important as their own life they must when they started it it was just simple local government area matter chairman of council that they were struggling for and to publicly say that we have won an election today those local governments are not even in their hands anymore today they cannot go home today governors are demanding for more security in their convoys today legislators are demanding for more security from their governors today commissioners are demanding for security
8890569 dont forget i was the speaker of the rivers state house of assembly i used to drive myself it was common knowledge i used to go to parties i used to visit people in their houses now i am not afraid to visit people in their houses because i come with enough security but my fear is that if i leave your house you will be kidnapped and people now accuse me of not being as accessible as i used to be when i was a speaker but they dont know i am saving them because i could come if i want to come no matter how tough it is with enough security to escort me to your house and i will sit and drink when i go i go with the same armed men you are left alone to the mercy of god and if you are not a good christian you are not praying well then too bad
8890570 i say my mind anywhere i go to worse can happen and i will tell you the truth these boys require force you know why they require force they are not ideological if the process today is ideological count me in i will bring out the resources of the rivers state government to back an ideological struggle because you cannot continue to cheat us remove our resources away and take it outside there and we are suffering and you expect me to keep quiet
8890571 i cannot back a criminal entity where people sit down and kidnap and do oil bunkering to the detriment of our economy and you say we will negotiate i am not part of the negotiation i have said to the world until we enforce the law to make it difficult for these criminals to know that they cannot kidnap anybody and get away with it the kidnapping will continue i have said to everybody that want to listen that what we are dealing with is poverty and unemployment these boys are poor these boys are poor and unemployed and no matter how much employment you bring today they are not willing to participate in any employment
8890572 you know why because kidnapping will bring 500 times the value of the money you will pay them as salary as governor i am paid n250 000 let us assume that you even pay ateke n250 000 per month will he come out because if he kidnaps one white man he will make n10 million if he kidnap 10 ten multiply by ten he is a multi millionaire so the major crisis we have is that we need value re orientation in the niger delta for the people to value one naira n250 000 is no longer money
8890573 when i was a speaker before i became governor i used to see some of them they tell me these are the people who are into this shooting and when they come they carry young girls they wear these jeans half of their buttocks and they come with jeeps and imagine if n250 000 can buy them jeeps it cannot we must enforce the law we must get the police and the security agencies to visit them where they are after that we must do value orientation
8890574 the state government has really done well with the early procurement and distribution of fertilizer and agro chemical to us very soon the entire state and nigeria as a whole will be flooded with food produce from nasarawa state
8890575 we intend to use the agricultural sector as a spring board for the setting up of small and medium scale enterprises for export promotion
8890576 by the way what became of your plan to go to the airport to welcome back the team nigeria from the olympics
8890577 dont mind me o if i want to be honest with myself the plan was dead on arrival
8890578 haba my brother why use such a morbid expression they say half bread is better than none at least the football team won the silver medal even if there was not much more to write home about
8890579 that is yesterdays glory and for how long more do we want to bask in past glories what the current performance has shown is that as far as sports are concerned we are champions in africa but not at the global level the nations female football has shown up this gross deficiency if nothing else our boxers and table tennis players also performed dismally can you imagine that half way through the games the chairman of the national sports commission was quoted as saying he was satisfied with the performance of the countrys contingent
8890580 i guess you do have a point there not even our athletes shone through our so called fastest man and medal hopeful remains an enigma only at home but i am still insisting that the root of the problem is that we do not have the right set of people administering sports development in this country the sports sector has suffered greatly in the hands of those who lack the capacity to deliver
8890581 we have lamented this over the years and there does not appear to be any willingness on the part of the government to wield the big axe look where it has got us even zimbabwe which is still being pummelled over its political leadership managed to get a gold medal and kenya which has just come through from what was more or less a civil war got a number of gold medals too
8890582 my brother dont let us fool ourselves any longer lack of planning and official laziness have dogged the nations sporting spirit for as long as i can remember you are likely to find that even the willing sportsman or woman is so frustrated with the attitude of the officials that many have taken up the nationality of other countries or simple put sports behind them and moved on do you know that the americans had booked an exclusive training area in china for their team six years ahead of the games this meant that on arrival in beijing they had their own space and did not have to compete for use of facilities with other nations now that is what i call planning
8890583 sometimes i wonder if we really went to china for the olympics we read that it has been shopping galore for both officials and the sports men and women alike i am pretty sure that the lobbies of the airports would be littered with bags and bags of stuff bound for lagos and shippers would also do brisk business on the china nigeria route as you know nigerians are known all over the world for packing grotesque amounts of luggage whenever travelling back home from abroad
8890584 my brother if you were in their shoes would you not shop until you drop
8890585 to be honest i really look forward to the day we will be amongst the top five on the medals table i would like to see the day our nation stands to receive gold medal after gold medal because we have prepared very well and have the right set of people managing the process

8890620 they are a typical northern side they fight and compete for every single ball and we have got to match that
8890621 if we match that with the quality that weve got well ask them some questions and hopefully go on to get a first home win

8890647 when we decided to build the stadium i wanted to anticipate the possibility of financial restrictions so i concentrated on youth
8890648 i also felt the best way to create an identity with the way we play football to get players integrated into our culture with our beliefs our values was to get them as young as possible and to develop them together
8890649 what amazes me is that the critics who say i dont understand the mechanisations of this practice often have not even read the book nor do they have evidence to the contrary while they may not like its content they cant deny historical fact and trying to censor this book is denying the past
8890650 this is the only book dedicated entirely to this segment of history in this country
8890651 it is not my personal perspective on history i am not creating a violent representation of maori society im retelling the stories and documenting it for preservation but the critics have responded with attacks against me not my work which is simply baffling and very disappointing
8890652 im always ready to communicate on this issue and topic but the bitterness towards me personally is surprising and wont be tolerated
8890653 of all the books ive written and there are 15 of them this one has really had the most vitriolic response its hit a real nerve
8890654 there appears to be a desire to sanitise the history and slowly these stories are being weeded out of new zealand history in a sort of deliberate collective amnesia
8890655 this book is based on integrity and will stand up to close scrutiny a study needed to be done to explore why it happened and why it finished
8890656 anyone who feels that this work is a sleight on maori society today is misapplying the science of epigenetics what happened that far back has no bearing on todays society
8890657 the violence is quite graphic even if it is not prominent
8890658 but honestly what appears is not the worst of what i found recorded

8890692 some people get married because they feel like its the expected thing to do or they dont want to be alone or because theyre ready to start a family
8890693 getting married is not the only life choice available for a happy life
8890694 the most important thing is that i continue to grow as a person i want to be the happiest person i can possibly be
8890695 if that means i end up staying single for the rest of my life because i havent found the right mate thats perfectly all right with me im fine with taking on the role of the hip spinster aunt to my siblings kids
8890696 we felt it was a sound business decision to encourage the match as it helped us to illustrate the importance of the relationship foster an attitude of business collaboration and fortify the bond between the two cities this is crucial for our enterprise and others like us in the uk or the us it means that we can do anything together sell uk made cbrn suits throughout america or play against each other in a friendly rugby match
8890697 the inaugural mayors cup challenge match was a resounding success regardless of the final score of the match we had a fabulous experience in our sister city of dundee and a very successful trip on behalf of both alexandrias rugby team and its business community we feel that remploy frontlines support of alexandria rugby and the twinned cities programme will prove to be just as beneficial to our hometown as it is for dundee we look forward to building on what weve started over the years to come
8890698 remploy frontline is very proud to have been a part of this unique twinned city event we hope that our involvement in this programme encourages more businesses and organisations in both cities to look more closely at ways they can support the business and cultural exchanges based on remploy frontlines mission it would be great if alexandria and dundee can create more opportunities for otherwise disabled people and help further enrich their lives

8890706 this finding may eventually lead to the development of new drugs to regulate appetite in people who have not had success with other treatments
8890707 these microdomains are so tiny you could fit five million on them on a full stop there are 10 000 receptors on each cell and we are able to follow how single drug molecules bind to individual receptors in these specialised microdomains
8890708 what makes this single molecule laser technique unique is that we are looking at them in real time on a living cell other techniques that investigate how drugs bind to their receptors require many millions of cells to get a big enough signal and this normally involves destroying the cells in the process
8890709 once developed this molecule will cause much less wheezing and shortness of breath and should be able to be given safely to the hundreds of thousands of patients with both heart and lung diseases furthermore because it will have so few side effects it has the potential to become the beta blocker of choice for all heart patients
8890710 we know that beta blockers save lives in patients with heart disease so making them safe for those unlucky enough to have a respiratory disorder as well is a clinical imperative i applaud jill baker for questioning why beta blockers should remain contraindicated for so many of her patients and being stirred to correct this with an incisive programme of work in the best traditions of medical research this endeavour was born out of a problem encountered at the sharp end of clinical practice

8890723 he has been elected as the leader of the liberal party to take the liberal party to the next election and to win the next election and he will have my total and utter support in doing that

8890728 what dr nelson was referring to is that he would be very happy for mr costello to stay on in parliament the spokesman said
8890729 costello is undeniably the liberal partys best political asset now that howard has gone which is why so much turns on whether he recovers the will to serve which so clearly and understandably wavered in the aftermath of the election mr abbott wrote in

8890768 it may move towards a rediscovery of the celebratory by hinting at the gratuitous mysteriousness of what theology deals with the sense of a language trying unsuccessfully to keep up with a datum that is in excess of any foresight any imagined comprehensive structure and the cycle begins again
8890769 i want to see how well i can do but thats as far as it goes
8890770 id like to win it before i retire but im only 25 ive got a lot more years of racing ahead of me
8890771 also ive never ridden the tour of spain before and that lack of experience could weigh against me
8890772 for now im just one of the contenders for the overall victory
8890773 taking part in the tour of italy and winning it was a really big achievement bigger than if id had a second victory in the tour de france
8890774 now in the tour of spain i want to enjoy myself see what happens and do as well as possible
8890775 when i was an amateur several times the race went past my house back then to me if you took part in the tour of spain you were a professional
8890776 just taking part in the tour of spain means a dream ive had since i was very young has finally come true
8890777 i need to be in good shape for the pyrenees at the end of the first week but i have to be on top of my game is for the angliru climb on stage 13

8890780 the suspicion would arise that someone in the united states created this conflict on purpose to stir up the situation and to create an advantage for one of the candidates in the competitive race for the presidency in the united states
8890781 we have serious reasons to believe that directly in the combat zone citizens of the united states were present
8890782 that united states citizens were present in the combat zone that means only one thing that they could be there only on the direct instruction of their leadership and if this is so then it means that american citizens are in the combat zone performing their duties and they can only do that following a direct order from their leader and not on their own initiative
8890783 what was the gentlemans purpose of being among the special forces and what he is doing today i so far cannot answer
8890784 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8890785 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one of the sides and push it into the murder of the other side and its over it seemed like an easy solution the thing is it turns out that its not always so

8890790 zij wisten dat onze dochter ziek was waarom hebben ze ons daar dan niet van op de hoogte gebracht als we het zouden geweten hebben hadden we tenminste nog iets kunnen doen

8890796 elliotte thought more deeply about it and realized that making the code more complex in that manner would not have been an improvement
8890797 1 adding a branch would not be a performance hit because any recent cpu has branch prediction and insturuction prefetch etc it is only a hit once when the prediction proves wrong and the loop needs to terminate still thats less instructions than executing the loop a few more times

8890806 how we think about licences is getting a bit more nuanced
8890807 eclipse is an important lively and healthy project with an enormous plug in and developer community that uses an otherwise duplicative licence they arent interested in using the bsd or other open source licences that are readily combinable with epl code
8890808 we have decided that after nearly two years of operation that it was time to add the epl and serve these open source developers
8890809 the commission will be considering this in the coming weeks
8890810 as a result over 400 million consumers across europe have benefited from significant savings of around 60 per cent when making and receiving calls during travel holiday or business

8890813 ive just watched her grow the product and blossom as a person and a businesswoman
8890814 if id had that it would have saved a lot of struggle
8890815 i was blown away by the buzz i felt competing in the gladiators arena again
8890816 it was like id never been away the audience was explosive and phenomenal and clearly wanted more of the wolfman hearing them chant my name brought back some incredible memories and it all made me realise how much i just had to come back
8890817 i had no idea now that i know that its even more special
8890818 when i was doing the apple tree on broadway producer barry fuller told me about the show and said i know olive isnt quite there yet but he told me what was going to happen it sounded like a real growth part and well i went for it now its like a glove for me he writes well for me and thats what every actor hopes and dreams
8890819 you will see her have her sound of music moment
8890820 shes going to get a love interest this year too
8890821 i had a ghost writer im not going to pretend im a writer but i worked on it for three months its not a memoir im not old enough but it is about my life my adoption
8890822 they led me to what i am today usually when people hear youre adopted the first thing they say is have you found your birth parents yet well im not interested in that i believe you connect with the people who raise you if you met my parents youd say she is so their kid but we dont look alike theyre tall and brunette and cant sing but theyre mine
8890823 i was nervous to tell my mom she was always like if you ever want to find your real parents well help you but i told her how i felt and she and my dad were thrilled there is no wrong decision some people just dont need to search
8890824 id be a liar if i said it was happy and all roses all the time but do we hate each other no we couldnt do that show if we hated each other we just have very different ways of working our processes are extremely different but there was no denying what we brought on stage and that was the most important thing
8890825 id get called into will rogers follies and theyd say are you in for the kid part no im in for the lead girl i learned very quickly
8890826 you know i played both baby june and dainty june in gypsy
8890827 i grew up in the city but my cousins grew up in the country i used to tease them for showing pigs and now theyre like ha ha ha but im not going to complain this is one of the best times of my life

8890830 the roadside safety check is an effective tool to generate voluntary compliance by the motoring public
8890831 with the summer season coming to a close there is more inclination to be involved in outside activities that frequently involve alcohol especially around the labor day holiday weekend the potential to come across these checks encourages motorists to arrange designated drivers and keep their consumption of alcohol within the allowable limits
8890832 id actually make the point that for us second hand sales is a very critical situation because people are selling multiple times intellectual property
8890833 what were trying to do is build business models that are more and more online supported with additional services and additional content that you get online so people will see the value in not just getting that physical disc to play at home alone but actually playing those games online and paying for them

8890839 it is highly regrettable and frankly astonishing that the nuj is balloting for strike action at a time when the telegraph is creating 40 new jobs for journalists even in the middle of a serious economic downturn
8890840 of course we are making essential changes to our business as well as all media organisations are and are simply asking some production journalists to work a five day week like their colleagues we recognise that this will impact on some people and were making a significant payment of 3 000 to all those affected
8890841 weve made extensive efforts to communicate with all our staff as well as with the nuj well continue to do so
8890842 multiskilled journalists who are able to do everything from write to commission to edit to produce both online and print
8890843 our members regret that they have been forced into this action by a company that is refusing to negotiate on matters that were already agreed under existing terms and conditions
8890844 bosses at the telegraph are treating their staff with a shocking level of contempt they seem to think they can simply ignore their workers employment rights and conceal this exploitation with the announcement of new jobs that will make scant difference to overall staffing levels
8890845 on top of all this they are demanding staff work extra hours without any proper consultation or improvement on their consolidated pay and are creating a two tier workforce by offering new joiners inferior conditions no wonder journalists have had enough
8890846 sadly this disregard for our members loyalty and hard work seems to be a culture that has dominated the newsroom since the barclay brothers bought the papers

8890858 i live in fear of reprisal attacks and the council wont remove the data
8890859 i needed planning permission and its proper that the public can see that but when my signature was available on the internet i thought it was very worrying it could be copied
8890860 while specific regulations may allow local authorities to make planning applications publicly available not all of the details provided by applicants have to be published
8890861 there is a strong indication that new forest district council has failed to comply with the first principle of the data protection act 1998 in this case
8890862 despite the currently high streamflows effects of the drought likely will linger as ground water levels have not returned to normal

8890874 we have completed a cursory search of the annexe part of the main building which is relatively intact following the fire

8890888 by employing the powers of genomic technology it is now possible to know with near certainty that a particular individual was at a particular location even with only trace amounts of dna and even if dozens or even hundreds of others were there too

8890899 antwoord op de zoektocht van joseph smith in 1820 naar de vraag bij welke kerk hij zich moest aansluiten ontving hij een visioen waarin hij god en jezus christus zag
8890900 in tegenstelling tot de meeste andere christelijke gemeenschappen ziet de kerk niet alleen isra l maar ook het amerikaanse continent als het beloofde land christus is hier reeds verschenen nadat hij in isra l had geleefd overigens is hij toen volgens het boek van mormon ook aan de tien verloren stammen van isra l verschenen desalniettemin wordt ook in deze kerk geloofd dat jezus zal wederkomen in isra l volgens de bijbelse profetie n
8890901 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity
8890902 as the commission finds are necessary to diminish eliminate or prevent such burden
8890903 in retrospect we could definitely have bettered it ill say that straight up
8890904 given the time we had it is what it is

8890928 we need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
8890929 to put conservative values and conservative ideas into the thick of the fight for justice and opportunity
8890930 they had their chance they have not led we will
8890931 on occasion he rambled through excessive repetition bush is most effective in personal contact not a set speech
8890932 how and what we do for all of you the people who pay the taxes bear the burdens and live the american dream
8890933 cant understand how a guy like george w bush can be leading a guy with the kind of caliber experience and know how as al gore
8890934 make sure that our prosperity enriches not just the few but all working families
8890935 i believe we must challenge a culture with too much meanness and not enough meaning
8890936 oh can you take care of her oh maybe you can spare her several moments of your consideration leading up to the final destination
8890937 oh the earth is calling out i wanna learn what its all about but everything i read global warming going green i dont know what all this means but it seems to be saying wake up america
8890938 hes a hero hes going to bring pollution down to zero
8890939 i know that you dont want to hear it especially coming from someone so young
8890940 stand up ill try if you will wake up its not a fire drill
8890941 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8890942 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8890943 in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
8890944 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8890945 i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power
8890946 ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america
8890947 ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars
8890948 and ill invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8890949 both candidates are talking about energy high prices and global warming so its important to look past the rhetoric and see what is at the heart of their plans
8890950 as this scorecard illustrates the contrast in this election could not be starker
8890951 barack obama wants to give tax relief and 1 000 energy rebates to working families while john mccain wants billions more in tax breaks for oil companies making more than 1 000 a second in profits
8890952 thats why i came here tonight to tell you why i feel so strongly that we must seize this opportunity to elect barack obama president of the united states of america
8890953 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
8890954 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve ever experienced in the history of humankind
8890955 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
8890956 many scientists predict shockingly that the entire north polar ice cap may be completely gone during summer months during the first term of the next president
8890957 sea levels are rising fires are raging storms are stronger military experts warn us our national security is threatened by massive waves of climate refugees destabilizing countries around the world and scientists tell us the very web of life is endangered by unprecedented extinctions
8890958 in spite of john mccains past record of open mindedness and leadership on the climate crisis he has now apparently allowed his party to browbeat him into abandoning his support of mandatory caps on global warming pollution
8890959 the carbon fuels industry big oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and they are drilling it for everything its worth
8890960 that america is the best country on earth and a place where everybody if they work hard can achieve great things
8890961 this country needs someone with his intelligence honesty and values
8890962 i feel strongly that this country needs to change direction
8890963 to the love of my life our next first lady and to sasha and malia i love you so much and im so proud of all of you

8890969 on november fourth we must stand up and say eight is enough
8890970 now let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect
8890971 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8890972 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8890973 barack obamas speech tonight laid out his specific bold solutions and optimistic vision for our nation and our childrens future his speech crystallized the clear choice between he and senator mccain four more years of the same failed policies or a leader who can tackle the great challenges we face revitalizing our economy and restoring our standing in the world i am proud to support senator obama our next president of the united states and joe biden our next vice president of the united states
8890974 gov crist now has an opportunity to make a lasting impact on the florida supreme court much like president bush has been able to do on the u s supreme court
8890975 hell be able to pick people who reflect his judgment and his conservative principles
8890976 theres no better way to accentuate your beliefs than with appointments to the court
8890977 this has not been a partisan court if i thought we were getting ideologues on the court id be concerned
8890978 through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well thats why i stand here tonight because for 232 years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8890979 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8890980 next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8890981 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8890982 you have shown what history teaches us that at defining moments like this one the change we need doesnt come from washington change comes to washington change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time america this is one of those moments i believe that as hard as it will be the change we need is coming because ive seen it because ive lived it
8890983 i always dreamed id be standing next to my friend former denver broncos player floyd little
8890984 one of the greatest gifts of our democracy is the opportunity it offers us every four years to change our course
8890985 its not a guarantee its an opportunity we must seize this opportunity to elect barack obama president of the united states of america
8890986 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man
8890987 why is this election so close well i know something about close elections so let me offer you my opinion
8890988 i think the forces of the status quo are afraid of the change barack obama represents
8890989 his obamas experience has taught him something that career politicians often over look that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governments
8890990 john mccain is the first candidate in history who thinks he can win by telling voters theyre not thinking for themselves
8890991 lets be honest america john mccain may pay hundreds of dollars for his shoes but were the ones that will pay for his flip flops
8890992 america faces a simple choice do we want more of the same or is it time to change america
8890993 in the light of the turbulence in the banking and housing sectors the first six months of this year have been very challenging for b amp b
8890994 in the light of continuing weakness in the housing market and the wider economy
8890995 to expect arrears and repossessions to increase for the remainder of the year
8890996 os dados do pib foram encorajadores e isso o que o investidor realmente quer ver uma melhora na economia
8890997 comment policy the owner editor admin authors and moderators of the democratic daily reserve the right to edit or delete comments as per our guidelines including comments that are offensive or inappropriate violent or abusive or off topic and ridiculous
8890998 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8890999 when he walks out onstage tonight in front of 75 000 to 80 000 people hes a very tangible symbol of whats at stake in a presidential election
8891000 anyone who looks at al gore and whats happened over the last eight years knows whats at stake
8891001 im leaning obama but im still mad its a childish mad but there it is
8891002 i wasnt going to let my disappointment stand in the way of being at what is an historic event
8891003 we need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
8891004 mccain has voted with bush 90 of the time im not willing to take a 10 chance on change
8891005 sees the fundamental cause of the worlds problems in the very expansion of homo sapiens
8891006 we need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
8891007 mccain has voted with bush 90 of the time im not willing to take a 10 chance on change
8891008 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power
8891009 i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
8891010 os temores sobre o aperto no cr dito ainda existem e a confian a continua fraca mas muitas dessas preocupa es provavelmente j foram refletidas nas perdas que vimos este m s
8891011 being in like minded company with people who support the cause
8891012 it was inspiring to see the mix of black and white old and young
8891013 once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches this transition
8891014 the question simply put is will we seize the opportunity for a change
8891015 why is the election so close its close today because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change that barack obama represents
8891016 and then let us leave here tonight and take that message of hope from denver
8891017 and do everything we can to serve our nation our world and our children and their future by electing barack obama president of the united states of america
8891018 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
8891019 involved engaged and getting briefings and working to make sure that the federal assistance is there
8891020 now is the time to prepare yourself your family and your friends
8891021 one of the most important lessons we learned after hurricane katrina was that there is no substitute for awareness and self help especially in the days before a hurricane is predicted to hit
8891022 the frenchman is set to sign a two year deal with the option for a third year with the blues for an undisclosed fee the move will be completed subject to a medical
8891023 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8891024 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive because next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight on nov 4 we must stand up and say eight is enough
8891025 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8891026 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8891027 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families
8891028 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them gore said
8891029 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8891030 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8891031 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the startups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8891032 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8891033 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8891034 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8891035 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8891036 the carbon based interests oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and theyre drilling it for everything its worth
8891037 some of the best marketers have the worst products and this is certainly true of todays republican party
8891038 the most powerful country in the world to the weakest
8891039 why do they dislike intelligence in this country in leaders
8891040 senator i knew abe lincoln abe lincoln was friend of mine senator youre no abe lincoln
8891041 we are facing a planetary emergency which is not like anything we have experienced in the history of humankind
8891042 the solutions to all three require us to end our dependence on carbon based fossil fuels
8891043 we need to invest in innovation i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out to tackle that
8891044 now apparently allowed his party to browbeat him into abandoning mandatory caps on planet warming carbon
8891045 the carbon based industries have a 50 year lease on the republican party and theyre drilling it for all its worth
8891046 taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
8891047 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving the climate crisis
8891048 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed
8891049 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8891050 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8891051 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8891052 i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8891053 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder forless
8891054 more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8891055 the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8891056 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8891057 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
8891058 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8891059 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8891060 sportsmen have been stereotyped as concerned with one issue guns but if you listen to sportsmen as i have over the years we hear a different story
8891061 democrats are all about conservation they are all about preservation i think thats a huge opportunity
8891062 with sen obama you have a lifetime record of supporting gun control voting for gun control speaking out against gun rights and voting against gun rights either as an elected official or a private citizen
8891063 in four short years bush turned that around and we now have debt for years to come
8891064 right now we need to campaign on turning virginia from a red state to a blue state
8891065 im talking to people every day who were republicans forever but are just not able to do it this year
8891066 for years and years they bought the plan to cut taxes but the middle class now is beginning to catch up with that idea and understand that a trick has been pulled on them
8891067 i want to vote for somebody who is going to deliver what he says he is going to do
8891068 forget about the wealthy think about the people and help the middle class rather than the wealthy
8891069 we have got a good start but we have our work cut out for us all across the country
8891070 we need to bring the lost to the light and reap the harvest
8891071 this election if probably one of the most important of my grandchildrens lives
8891072 i think historically we have left behind the disadvantaged and the people the policy was developed for
8891073 i think obama has done things more than any candidate to reach out to my generation
8891074 compare that to john mccain who said he barely knew how to use the internet and had to have help from his wife
8891075 the campaign of barack obama and joe biden is a very exciting one
8891076 we want a change that is going to help us all
8891077 their strength is not only how they campaign but how they govern
8891078 there are the hard core more conservative ones who will vote for him but hold their nose
8891079 the number of problems both at home and abroad are more significant and i think the desire for a change new leadership and a new vision is needed now more than ever
8891080 mit tiefer dankbarkeit und gro er demut akzeptiere ich die nominierung f r die pr sidentschaft der vereinigten staaten
8891081 amerika wir sind besser als diese letzten acht jahre wir lieben dieses land zu sehr als dass die kommenden vier jahre aussehen wie die vergangenen acht
8891082 ich werde den krieg im irak verantwortungsbewusst beenden und den kampf gegen el kaida und die taliban in afghanistan zu ende f hren
8891083 amerika braucht mehr als einen gro en pr sidenten um den traum meines vaters zu verwirklichen
8891084 we came late so we wouldnt have a line and we havent had a line yet
8891085 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8891086 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8891087 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8891088 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8891089 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8891090 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8891091 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8891092 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8891093 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8891094 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8891095 esto ha sido un milagro si nos dan en la cabeza aqu quedamos
8891096 ca an a una velocidad terrible desde un s ptimo piso imag nese
8891097 este edificio es un peligro y tendr n que revisarlo en su totalidad
8891098 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8891099 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8891100 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8891101 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8891102 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8891103 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8891104 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8891105 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
8891106 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
8891107 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
8891108 theres nothing out there man you go take a picture of nothing
8891109 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8891110 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8891111 a political party that believes that it is my right as an american to varnish in an unventilated room comedy centrals stephen colbert explains in this interview
8891112 the campaign is going good about 6 percent across the country says barr a former republican congressman from georgia who left his party he says his party has gotten a spot on the ballots of 48 states
8891113 disgruntled hillary supporters who say they will vote for republican john mccain
8891114 i dont think the disgruntled hillary supporters would be big on bob barr
8891115 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8891116 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8891117 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8891118 why dont these bloody people just knock their nonsense off
8891119 as perplexed as people whod togged up for a fancy dress party and gone to the wrong address
8891120 at their age i was disdaining the opportunity of a free university education in favour of loafing and trying to scratch a living as a rock journalist theyd voyaged halfway around the world to fix a busted country
8891121 the soldiers swept their rifles back and forth up and down then gathered in a corner
8891122 this is ridiculous observed rana correctly we stopped so did the soldiers i told the one who seemed to be in charge that he was spoiling our walk youre spoiling our patrol he grinned
8891123 who arent doing smart things that they should or are doing daft things they shouldnt
8891124 point 4 the palestinians get properly organized and stop being so silly and the israelis cease acting like jerks
8891125 full of meaning and full of opportunity and if you as i believe and i know a lot of you do we did not lose the last election nor did al gore lose his last election we won it
8891126 ill screw around on my sick wife and make her lie in front of the cameras about it
8891127 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8891128 barry goldwater ran for president and he lost mo udall ran for president and he lost bruce babbit ran for president and he lost for this next election thats one arizona political tradition id like to see continue
8891129 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush more than 90 of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8891130 i will always call him governor bush because thats the last political office he was legitimately elected to
8891131 and it is now under investion they were fixed computors
8891132 there are too many republican robber barons in this nation and they exist and survive vy the use of the worst deceptive practices and tactics paying out to those whod sell their souls to put their republican puppet in the white house to enrich themselves and destroy america and its middle class and its working population these robber barons need to be crushed to a pulp to save america and its leadership in the world
8891133 fewer believe that those provided the margin of victory or that kerry was robbed of victory the way democrats think gore was robbed
8891134 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
8891135 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
8891136 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
8891137 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
8891138 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision
8891139 we would really like to see some blue at the end of the tunnel this year
8891140 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8891141 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8891142 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8891143 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8891144 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8891145 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8891146 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
8891147 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
8891148 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
8891149 the five senators alan cranston d ca dennis deconcini d az john glenn d oh john mccain r az and donald w
8891150 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 8 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
8891151 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
8891152 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
8891153 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
8891154 weve had thousands die in the first few years and mccain wants to keep it up for 100 more years
8891155 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
8891156 so long as they are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
8891157 if they asked me id say spend your time in ohio or some of these other states where its going to be very close
8891158 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8891159 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8891160 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again the last best hope for those who are called to the cause of peace
8891161 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8891162 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8891163 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me
8891164 on november 4 we must stand up and say eight years is enough
8891165 let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect
8891166 im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
8891167 i dont believe senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8891168 why else would he define middle class as someone making under us5 million a year
8891169 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8891170 hes now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8891171 the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8891172 look bro we are reaching if not already reached peak oil peak coal and peak natural gas
8891173 think of it this way the people having the most kids today are uneducated and poor so within a few years we will have a pretty dumb country
8891174 i agree with so many of you but particularly with
8891175 tell this headline to every uneducated person from a third world or
8891176 let this limited children initiative start with the third world countries and the islamic families that are currently trying to out produce the rest of us in order to take over
8891177 i wish i had know this before we had three
8891178 as usual another bible thumper that cannot offer proof to back up his beliefs
8891179 to muttonhead31 since you asked i will respond by repeating myself look around you
8891180 that mountain is not really there everyone is just imagining it
8891181 mixdown it is not a personal attack it is math
8891182 to mixdown you believe there is a god and thats what this country is all about but show me the proof that u speak of
8891183 about the argument over being frugal with resources in having more than two kids
8891184 to the jackal if you cant find proof that god exists then you are blind
8891185 wowsers this from scientists that are generally left of center politically and all in favor of the usa becoming north mexico in a few years
8891186 i recently saw a item on this on pbs and was shocked at how soon this is goign to become a global problem
8891187 i cant believe that people get so up in arms about the suggestion that they not have huge families i have chosen not to have kids and am regularly attacked for the decision by people who do choose to have them

8891189 in america we have generations of welfare recipients who beleive the more kids you have the more the government will reward you so why would they ever stop having children besides how else would the women be able to buy those new 24
8891190 i myself have only two children but i resent the premise of these arguments
8891191 it is about time someone took this thought process public in a more aggressive manner
8891192 the next six months are going to tell the story

8891197 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies

8891204 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace who yearn for a better future

8891207 we know were not perfect but were always striving to do the best for the environment
8891208 there is currently no company policy about opening or closing doors but we acknowledge the need to minimize energy use and are investigating different strategies such as using air fans which would prevent the cold air from leaving the building even with the door open
8891209 i would say something about it we are the customers and so i think they would value hearing from us
8891210 i would probably go in and say were all trying to conserve energy pasadena is a very green city so it would be best if you didnt pour your air conditioning into the outside world and i might say that im not inclined to shop in a place that hasnt caught on to the green spirit of pasadena
8891211 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8891212 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8891213 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8891214 john mccain will pay hundreds of dollars for his own shoes but were the ones who have to pay for his flip flops
8891215 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8891216 and democrats we must also admit that fulfilling americas promise will require more than just money
8891217 what does it say about your judgement when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time
8891218 the idea that were responsible for ourselves but we also rise and fall as a nation
8891219 ive been criticized for saying he inspires me to hell with my critics
8891220 he took the last 8 years of the bush administration and said enough
8891221 i thought it was riveting i thought it was stunning he really did a fine job
8891222 he did everything he was supposed to do it was really inspiring
8891223 candidate dialogue does not seem to help anyone learn during a campaign
8891224 there are not many papers that go right to the core of some of the assumptions of democratic theory the way this one does
8891225 c andidate dialogue does not seem to help anyone learn during a campaign
8891226 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
8891227 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
8891228 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
8891229 mother nature in the form of planet earth is about 4 5 billion years old way older than even madonna
8891230 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8891231 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8891232 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8891233 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8891234 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8891235 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8891236 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8891237 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8891238 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8891239 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8891240 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8891241 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8891242 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8891243 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8891244 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8891245 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8891246 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8891247 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8891248 its a very ugly syndrome in democratic politics because its a scapegoat syndrome
8891249 i dont think this country deserves a least worse choice
8891250 its decaying its lost its soul they never talk about the poor they talk about the middle class
8891251 service us in all kinds of ways while they are underpaid while they are overcharged
8891252 its our job to sweep the rascals out of the political forums who have corrupted our country
8891253 almost everything we like about our country started with minority dissenters
8891254 we will let the people of connecticut know that even though obama is likely to take it they at least have a choice to send the democrats a message that their votes are not going to be taken for granted
8891255 i saw squirming politicians and i saw free speech in action
8891256 that was a far greater civic education than anything i learned in my formal education
8891257 if only you knew the power you have at this young age
8891258 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8891259 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8891260 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8891261 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
8891262 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
8891263 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
8891264 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people
8891265 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
8891266 we cannot afford four more years of failing economics and a falling economy for the change we need to lift working families across our nation for the change we need to ensure the american dream is within reach of all of us we must send barack obama to the white house
8891267 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8891268 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8891269 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8891270 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8891271 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8891272 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8891273 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8891274 he is not in the intensive care unit he is in a reserved room
8891275 whenever news like this comes out all tibetans inside and outside tibet remain concerned it is a matter of concern for the future of tibet
8891276 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
8891277 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
8891278 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
8891279 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
8891280 when people rightly complain about higher gasoline prices we propose to give more money to the oil companies and pretend that theyre going to bring prices down
8891281 i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
8891282 the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
8891283 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
8891284 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
8891285 candidate mccain now supports the wartime tax cuts that senator mccain once denounced as immoral candidate mccain criticizes senator mccains own climate change bill candidate mccain says he would now vote against the immigration bill that senator mccain wrote are you kidding talk about being for it before youre against it
8891286 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8891287 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8891288 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8891289 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
8891290 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
8891291 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
8891292 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
8891293 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads
8891294 solar and wind along with possible tidal and geothermal will do the job
8891295 i said i was looking for a book to read laura said you ought to try camus i also read three shakespeares ive got a eck a lec tic reading list the key for me is to keep expectations low

8891311 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 per cent of the time
8891312 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8891313 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8891314 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8891315 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own
8891316 our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work
8891317 thats the promise of america the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
8891318 i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington

8891324 we are very very sad and disappointed that we thought we could pull through this very difficult situation
8891325 the investors in people standard provides a framework that helps organisations to improve performance and realise objectives through the effective management and development of their people
8891326 het britse ministerie van defensie kent uiteraard de standaard personeelszaken zoals werving en selectie maar ook behoud van medewerkers inwerkprogrammas primaire en secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden opleiding en ontwikkeling sociale voorzieningen doorgroeimogelijkheden gelijke behandeling talentmanagement etc
8891327 we in government have a responsibility to recognise the commitment and sacrifice our armed forces make for our country and in return we must look after them and their families to do this we need the entire government working together in a comprehensive and co ordinated way we also need to look at how we can make the best of the support offered by other organisations and charities who make an important and much appreciated contribution
8891328 iip recognition across the whole department is a fantastic achievement particularly as it has been attained against a backdrop of change programmes and intense operational demands the iip process is in effect an audit of what we are doing to improve our management of people and although there is much still to do recognition confirms that we are on the right track the mod recognises the importance of training and developing staff and is working hard to be an even better employer
8891329 with so many facets to the department communicating our overall goal was a true challenge investors in people is making an ongoing contribution to continuous improvements in our performance

8891340 the editor in chief of masternewmedia said while showing me some websites
8891341 he went on showing me some other articles on the web
8891342 consider this while editing someone else work have they capitalized their titles correctly have they chunked their paragraph to allow the reader scan it have they chosen the right image to associate with every paragraph
8891343 yep he was right the proper way is choosing an image which immediately matches to the message conveyed by the article just as a magnet
8891344 i mean how can he be sure i was not a douchebag and buy some crazy stuff i dont know maybe because hes such a talented teacher i think he knows whos in front of him from the very first words thats why every day i feel like im learning a lot

8891367 i think that it is wrong that a player can play for two clubs in any competition scoring a goal for one team one week and then scoring against them a few weeks later
8891368 i also think we have to look at both the summer and winter transfer windows
8891369 the season starts in many countries in july or early in august yet the transfer window does not close until the end of august
8891370 then we have another window in the middle of the season i think we need to look at the way the system works
8891371 the faxed offer from marseille yesterday was for a two day trial with the possibility of a free loan
8891372 that is completely and utterly unacceptable in fact its laughable both the chairman adam pearson and the manager paul jewell communicated this to the player directly and to marseille and made it clear that as the offer stood there would be no deal

8891399 barack obamas acceptance speech tonight wasnt what people have come to expect from a barack obama speech it wasnt filled with lofty rhetoric or grand cadences it did not induce tears or euphoria
8891400 for a speech before 80 000 people and doric columns in a football stadium barack obama might have been expected to summon winged chariots f 14s and maybe a marching band when he finished hats would be cast into the air and rent shirts would litter the floor obama didnt deliver that speech

8891413 with no proper leadership in place then the players formed an interim committee to run the affairs of golf and this had myself and simon katembenuka and ryan lang among others
8891414 we faced a lot of challenges and so did potential sponsors and corporates
8891415 at times it was myself and tongo charamba who had to sponsor the tournaments from our own pockets
8891416 we realised that it was difficult to run the executive and at the same time play in tournaments
8891417 so we agreed that we set up sort of a board of directors that will run the affairs of the association while those who want to play can focus on playing
8891418 several people with a keen interest and vast knowledge of golf were picked to sit on this board
8891419 these people who have been selected to sit on the board are of integrity and have sound administration qualities
8891420 i believe they will be able to approach the right people in business who are able to invest in golf
8891421 i am positive that with such an approach we will be able to get tournaments running and even hold the zimbabwe open by the end of next year so that we are part of the sunshine tour
8891422 at the moment i am not aware what has happened to the constitution but we had tasked masunda who is a lawyer to look into the issue
8891423 the constitution has to be agreed to by the members and approved by the sports and recreation commission
8891424 cwu tv is the first made for television venture by any uk trade union this raises the game for trade union communications and puts the cwu in the forefront of modern trade union communications

8891426 simple moms spring cleaning guide is a gem for home managers i think that the skill of cleaning well is being lost at least it has been for me and her guide is a simple and helpful primer for those of us who have a few things to learn about the subject best of all she makes a normally overwhelming task seem lighthearted and manageable im definitely planning to implement several of her tips into my own household
8891427 the forms provided are great and i am loving everything about it
8891428 an excellent spring cleaning guide that is completely realistic its about making your home a place you can enjoy living in not turning your life upside down to have a clean home
8891429 im finding out that once you start to reclaim surfaces beautiful bare dust free uncluttered wood surfaces
8891430 a place where you can connect with your friends imbee com makes it easy to share your audio video
8891431 i know what it is like to have no personal connection with lifeway

8891433 they do come round here at speed its a 30 mile an hour limit all the way through wilnecote
8891434 they tear along here like as if they havent got a minute to live some of the cars
8891435 we want some railings lights around the island to protect our property or some bollards anything to stop them going through my walls
8891436 i love manchester its got a really good feel to it
8891437 when youre john mccain theres not a lot you can do to draw your attention
8891438 the democrats have a week and then the republicans have a week and both of them will surge a little bit after their week
8891439 for broadcast news the obama campaign still had the monopoly this week
8891440 weve lost our homes weve lost our clothes weve lost everything
8891441 we are taking our children and leaving and we dont even know where we are going
8891442 my hungry children are crying and we are eating raw rice without boiling it
8891443 i know how villagers are somehow managing to keep themselves alive by eating whatever food is available to them
8891444 it is not easy to distribute food to over two million displaced villagers i know their condition
8891445 the camps are not organised yet and we are receiving reports of diseases
8891446 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in inter ethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8891447 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8891448 we have serious grounds to think that there were us citizens right in the combat zone
8891449 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8891450 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of us president
8891451 and if it didnt work out they could always put the blame on us make us look like the enemy and against the background of this surge of patriotism once more rally the country around a particular political force
8891452 it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8891453 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8891454 when i was their age this never would have happened
8891455 im not sure theyll grasp the meaning of this until later
8891456 but some day theyll look back on this and say i was there

8891461 these centres are primarily engaged in popularising science and technology through a wide range of science activities and interactive programmes these centres have become trendsetters in the field of science communication nationally as well as internationally
8891462 the proposals are under active consideration and a decision is likely to be taken by the end of 2008
8891463 biased and aimed at justifying the aggressive actions of georgia
8891464 theyve been saying loud and clear that they feel they could do whatever they want with impunity
8891465 but i think any kind of reaction they would take to the eu would be in kind like visa restrictions or a business contacts freeze i dont think the retaliation would include the kind of things like restricting oil

8891525 youre looking for an elmer the safety elephant to be scolding you from the side its organized chaos
8891526 it is plausible that when police are no longer here that people will cross when the red hand is flashing but that is a concern at every intersection across the city
8891527 at nighttime if theres no police here its a different corner man homeless people drunks i hate to say it but somebodys going to get hurt i hope it works but i think this is a publicity stunt for the city

8891590 the soul mate myth is destructive because it will keep you from forming authentic relationships that have a chance to thrive instead of fail

8891596 some people get married too quickly without really knowing each other well enough some people get married because of tax es or health insurance and other financial benefits
8891597 some people get married because they feel like its the expected thing to do or they dont want to be alone or because theyre ready to start a family
8891598 getting married is not the only life choice available for a happy life
8891599 the most important thing is that i continue to grow as a person i want to be the happiest person i can possibly be
8891600 if that means i end up staying single for the rest of my life because i havent found the right mate thats perfectly all right with me im fine with taking on the role of the hip spinster aunt to my siblings kids

8891607 en todo momento los carabineros preguntaban por armamento y el paradero de los pe i que est n requeridos por la justicia nuestros luchadores sociales mapuche se nos interroga por armas que jam s han encontrado ni jam s encontrar n porque no existen
8891608 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche

8891610 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

8891619 neruda sol a viajar desde temuco a puerto saavedra pues all un colono de apellido winter le prestaba libros en ese tiempo el poeta escribi sus primeras obras los borradores de los veinte poemas de amor pero en todos ellos no hay un solo indio neruda no los vio y eso que en puerto saavedra no hay m s que arena olas y mapuches
8891620 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
8891621 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo
8891622 esta es una vieja historia cargada de decepci n y frustraciones
8891623 no hay museo m s chic en chile que el museo de arte precolombino
8891624 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
8891625 nunca los ej rcitos chileno y argentino han demostrado mayor grado de cooperaci n y fraternidad que durante la pacificaci n de la araucan a que los argentinos conocen como
8891626 nosotros reconocemos en los mapuches a nuestros ancestros pero andar pregonando que uno ha matado al padre es feo
8891627 si ese fondo no hubiera existido acota bengoa hoy el problema ser a inmanejable
8891628 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
8891629 el primer gran desaf o que enfrent la conadi fue pronunciarse respecto del proyecto de construcci n de la central hidroel ctrica ralco que requer a aprobar la permuta de terrenos ind genas como los delegados del presidente en dicha organizaci n votaron en contra frei los cambi as la conadi perdi su legitimidad cuando se estrenaba en sociedad
8891630 el informe qued archivado en alg n escritorio en la moneda de donde no volvi a salir
8891631 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
8891632 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
8891633 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
8891634 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
8891635 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio
8891636 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas

8891641 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches
8891642 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia
8891643 estamos tratando de obtener la mayor informaci n y yo he reforzado la cantidad de funcionarios para ver si podemos detener a las personas que corresponden de acuerdo a las instrucciones de los fiscales
8891644 exigimos de la autoridad un alto a la represi n
8891645 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8891646 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8891647 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno

8891665 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui

8891746 the soul mate myth is destructive because it will keep you from forming authentic relationships that have a chance to thrive instead of fail

8891752 some people get married too quickly without really knowing each other well enough some people get married because of tax es or health insurance and other financial benefits
8891753 some people get married because they feel like its the expected thing to do or they dont want to be alone or because theyre ready to start a family

8891761 bend over that barrel and youll see the golden rivet
8891762 i discovered a paradox in the free market and it is this usually private ownership creates wealth but too much ownership has the opposite effect it creates gridlock
8891763 when too many owners control a single resource it can be a patent a copyright land when too many people control a single resource co operation breaks down and wealth disappears everybody ends up losing
8891764 imagine a drug developer walking into an auditorium and seeing 50 or 100 or several hundred patent owners each with their essential patent on their lap and the drug developer knows that unless hes able to negotiate successfully with every single one of those patent owners his drug cant come to market
8891765 a standard when it works can solve the problem of gridlock but to create the standard you need to get in the context of a dvd seven or eight hundred separate patents pooled together into a single patent pool but there are many areas that we dont have because entrepreneurs cant get the pools together or cant get the standard negotiated
8891766 there are tweaks to patent law so for example in the us the area of damages available for infringement of a patent needs to be fixed
8891767 when a patent is infringed the damages that are available now under american law are super compensatory they give much more to the patent owner than the contribution of that patent would have been to the product which means that a couple of lawsuits can sap the entire profits available from a new product

8891849 i want to pledge that the farming community especially the small scale farmers is prepared to increase maize production to levels recorded before
8891850 with the tractors ploughs harrows and other farming implements we are getting from government what can stop us from reaching the two million tonne mark that we used to produce
8891851 most of our farmers are communal and have to travel from the provinces as far as manicaland they require better prizes as incentives to exhibit again next year
8891852 we have been impressed by the produce on display and we want to encourage self sustenance as zimbabweans president mugabe did not err when he gave us land so let us go and produce on our part we will equip you and provide inputs to increase your output
8891853 iye zvino we have fuel shortages nekuda kwemasanctions iwaya the west has been lying to the whole world that the sanctions are only targeted at individuals such as president mugabe and dr gono and yet they are hurting everyone right now we are facing fuel shortages because of these sanctions

8891855 wherever on this planet ideals of personal freedom and dignity apply there you will find the cultural inheritance of england
8891856 there are many things in life more worthwhile than money one is to be brought up in this our england which is still the envy of less happy lands
8891857 cold heart and bloody hand now rule the english land
8891858 england has already lost the war it is only a matter of having the intelligence to admit it
8891859 bind her grind her burn her with fire cast her ashes into the sea she shall escape she shall aspire she shall arise to make men free she shall arise in a sacred scorn lighting the lives that are yet unborn spirit supernal splendor eternal england
8891860 england with all thy faults i love thee still my country and while yet a nook is left where english minds and manners may be found shall be constrained to love thee
8891861 they that have the power to hurt and will do none they rightly do inherit heavens graces
8891862 true heroism is remarkably sober very undramatic it is not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost but the urge to serve others at whatever cost
8891863 if heaven is about to entrust an important mission to a man it begins by filling his heart with bitterness and by confusing his powers of perception and overturning his plans it forces him to exert his bone and muscle it forces him to endure hunger and all manner of sufferings when the man emerges triumphantly over all these trials and tribulations he is then capable of accomplishing what would have been impossible for him to do before
8891864 the overall feeling and response to the film is staggering to me
8891865 its a very small story and i didnt worry too much about having much that was universal in it yet somehow its jumping to a more universal level
8891866 i knew from visiting my husbands home in malone new york near the canadian border that there was a smuggling culture that had been going on since before prohibition the way it got interesting to me was that i learned people did it by driving across the frozen river
8891867 i developed the story from that one main image i asked myself okay whos in that car what are their lives about what are they smuggling i thought a white woman and a mohawk woman would put an interesting spin it
8891868 it doesnt seem that way when you drive along route 30 you think okay there is nothing here but that is deceptive
8891869 everyone in hollywood just said the same thing over and over you have to recast melissa leo youll never get money with melissa leo my little mantra was if you can suggest to me an actress who can do this role better ill use her but i already knew nobody could do it better
8891870 not only did we shoot it on actual bodies of water that were frozen but melissa did her own driving we had a guy from clarkson university in potsdam n y who would come out and auger and make sure the ice was thick enough
8891871 it really was in the middle of nowhere it was so cold we had to worry about things like the camera freezing up which it did once it was so cold there was one day where the wind chill was about 20 below and we couldnt shoot outside
8891872 in terms of being a woman who makes her own way people help her but nobody really rescues her she rescues herself
8891873 i said to melissa lets look at rio bravo lets look at the searchers because we were talking about how to cary a lead role and how john wayne does it with so little hes not twisting up his face he gives nothing away in terms of expressions and yet everything is there
8891874 my family is sort of what i think of as my audience and thats people in the middle of the country not on the sides

8891876 dear lord i go to work every day and put in 8 hours while my wife merely stays at home i want her to know what i go through so please allow her body to switch with mine for a day amen god in his infinite wisdom granted the mans wish the next morning sure enough the man awoke as a woman he arose cooked breakfast for his mate awakened the kids set out their school clothes fed them breakfast packed their lunches drove them to school came home and picked up the dry cleaning took it to the cleaners and stopped at the bank to make a deposit went grocery shopping then drove home to put away the groceries paid the bills and balanced the checkbook he cleaned the cats litter box and bathed the dog then it was already 1 p m and he hurried to make the beds do the laundry vacuum dust and sweep and mop the kitchen floor ran to the school to pick up the kids and got into an argument with them on the way home set out milk and cookies and got the kids organized to do their homework then set up the ironing board and watched tv while he did the ironing at 4 30 he began peeling potatoes and washing vegetables for salad breaded the pork chops and snapped fresh beans for supper after supper he cleaned the kitchen ran the dishwasher folded laundry bathed the kids and put them to bed at 9 p m he was exhausted and though his daily chores werent finished he went to bed where he was expected to make love which he managed to get through without complaint the next morning he awoke and immediately knelt by the bed and said lord i dont know what i was thinking i was so wrong to envy my wifes being able to stay home all day please oh please let us trade back

8891881 i am extremely pleased that mr hsieh has joined gsi technologys board of directors we appreciate his qualifications and look forward to his contributions as we strive to sustain the companys current growth and address future business initiatives
8891882 i would also like to take this opportunity on behalf of the shareholders and employees of gsi technology to thank mr chen for his service and contributions throughout the past eleven years as a valued member of our board of directors
8891883 walgreens regional distribution center selected b2e so their employees can cash their checks in a safe environment and at a pre negotiated rate that promotes safety and productivity they especially like that b2e comes to their door meaning their employees can optimize their lunch break and never have to leave the site
8891884 our board of directors remains focused on providing our shareholders with a solid return through our cash dividend program
8891885 this dividend represents a 5 increase from the dividend paid in october of 2007 and reflects the boards confidence in our future prospects
8891886 the boards decision points to a challenging economic environment that is affecting the entire financial sector
8891887 it reflects as well federal and state regulatory requirements that due primarily to non cash goodwill impairment charges that resulted in net losses in 2007 and the first six months of 2008 effectively preclude the company from paying a cash dividend although the bank remains well capitalized it is important that we maintain liquidity and conserve capital
8891888 three years ago monsanto fund sponsored a study that showed that student interest in science drops at the fourth and fifth grade levels monsanto fund is committed to increasing the appeal of science as a career path and the video game medium has demonstrated itself to be an increasingly powerful way to engage todays digital generation
8891889 we are excited to be a part of a bold new initiative that could fundamentally rewrite the rules of student engagement
8891890 the national education assessment of education progress 2005 test showed that by grade 12 only 18 percent of u s students scored at or above the proficient level in science
8891891 with this partnership we now have the opportunity to use the video game platform to stem the tide of apathy toward science among elementary students and make it relevant exciting memorable and most importantly useful
8891892 iste has long been a proponent of game changing applications of technology in education
8891893 with our expertise in curriculum and our reach into countries around the world also interested in facilitating science education in young people we cant think of a more innovative approach and exciting venture to drive interest in and prepare our nearly 7 million fourth and fifth grade students for future success in this field we are eager to get started
8891894 there is also a possibility that karadzic will plead not guilty to all 11 counts as well as say that he is proud of what he did
8891895 if he refuses to enter a plea again on this occasion the judge in this case iain bonomy would enter a plea of not guilty in his name
8891896 we have not yet had a decision as to whether amendments will be made
8891897 if i were one of mccains vp picks that was passed over id be pretty happy tonight that i didnt have to be on a ticket trying to compete with that
8891898 it was a genuinely outstanding speech it was magnificent ive seen a lot of convention speeches this is probably the greatest speech this came out of the heart of america and he came right at the heart of america
8891899 obama has put a serious dent in mccains ability to continue campaigning with dumb soundbites and too cute by half innuendo this isnt a teenagers campaign for junior high student council he was saying its a campaign for president of the united states and youre old enough to know that you should damn well treat it that way
8891900 i also think he made the right decision to directly and in the case of the celeb meme explicitly confront the smears particularly the attacks on obamas americanness and patriotism the tone didnt strike me as defensive or outraged which is a different side of defensiveness but more one of what i might call assertive contempt
8891901 the most impressive campaign speech from an american presidential candidate i can recall in my lifetime
8891902 it was a liberal speech more unabashedly unashamedly liberal than any democratic acceptance speech since the great era of american liberalism but it made the case for that liberalism in the context of the decline of the american dream and the rise of cynicism and the collapse of cultural unity his ability to portray that liberalism as a patriotic unifying ennobling tradition makes him the most lethal and remarkable democratic figure since john f kennedy
8891903 only a moral cretin could fail to be inspired when the speech rolled around in its closing moments to martin luther king jr but that inspirational moment was just a moment and i think that the pundits and advisers who urged barack obama to temper his soaring rhetoric and produce a more workmanlike down to earth speech did him a disservice the speech had good lines and good sections but for the most part it felt surprisingly banal and jury rigged and it suffered throughout from a failure to cohere around any single theme or rhetorical style
8891904 but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8891905 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8891906 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8891907 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8891908 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
8891909 they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8891910 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8891911 corruption in water can lead to skewed and inequitable water resources allocation to uncontrolled and illegal pollution to groundwater over extraction and to degraded ecosystems
8891912 in many cases these impacts in turn result in reduced resilience and adaptability to the impacts of climate change
8891913 promise of a land where all men are free and equal
8891914 there are those who say to you we are rushing this issue of civil rights i say we are 172 years late
8891915 the time has arrived for the democratic party to get out of the shadow of states rights and walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights
8891916 standing up with courage and clear purpose they somehow managed to change the world
8891917 something is happening in america and people are prepared and ready to make that great leap

8891923 i absolutely and totally support brendan nelson the former treasurer told reporters
8891924 he has been elected as the leader of the liberal party to take the liberal party to the next election and to win the next election and he will have my total and utter support in doing that
8891925 as far as im concerned the liberal party leadership is a team of dr nelson and julie bishop and im supporting them
8891926 i intend to keep on serving the people of higgins he said
8891927 peters made his decision that he did not seek the leadership of the party he told reporters
8891928 as ive said before id be very happy if he changes his mind thats his business
8891929 what dr nelson was referring to is that he would be very happy for mr costello to stay on in parliament the spokesman said
8891930 costello is undeniably the liberal partys best political asset now that howard has gone which is why so much turns on whether he recovers the will to serve which so clearly and understandably wavered in the aftermath of the election mr abbott wrote in
8891931 nobody ever objects when people say nice things about them he said
8891932 theyll go play for some aau team in the summer and theyll like the other kids and theyll like the other coach
8891933 then all of a sudden they decide lets just go to the same school sally goes to it makes our job a little more difficult
8891934 theres such a strong collegial relationship with superintendents of school corporations that i dont think that will take place
8891935 we dont want to get into a stealing students kind of mode
8891936 i know ips is trying really hard to make a lot of changes
8891937 but the people who end up getting left behind are the students who achieve really well
8891938 what will happen is only students with families that can provide transportation which is huge will be even able to take advantage of that
8891939 we want to make sure that we dont overextend ourselves
8891940 the 140 number is easy for us to manage weve done it for years if its much more well have to go to plan b
8891941 i feel like i just hit the lottery and didnt have to buy a ticket
8891942 its all about opportunity and being able to choose and pick the best choice i honestly look at it as what a phenomenal opportunity for those who may not have the financial capability to pay private tuition

8892021 today was definitely a memorable experience and it was interesting to see behind the scenes
8892022 kurt is definitely an impressive representative for nascar for penske racing and for all his sponsors
8892023 we were so pleased to have him here back on campus to talk to our team i am certain that he made a great number of new race fans here today we just hope that hell take us up on our offer to come back and see us play this season
8892024 ive been here for over 10 years now and ive never seen anyone talk to our guys and have the impact that kurt did here today
8892025 he had their undivided attention for all 25 minutes the way he was able to relate what he does to what they will experience was so impressive

8892030 we were able to confirm the intended race recommendation as an appropriate tire setup for the upcoming race at kansas next month
8892031 we were very pleased with the results of the test as both drivers were able to complete long runs on the specified tire combination with positive feedback on grip and performance the right side tire has already seen action at both fontana with the cup and nationwide cars and kansas with the craftsman trucks earlier this year while the left side is a new code incorporating an updated construction that has a strong track record at the intermediate tracks this year

8892033 we are optimistic about being able to promote a sprint cup series event at kentucky speedway once we secure a sprint cup series event we plan to expand seating capacity and host some of the largest crowds in the midwest
8892034 kentucky speedway entertained sellout crowds for nascar nationwide series and indycar racing events this year with a sprint cup date season ticket sales seat licenses and corporate sponsorship opportunities will increase tremendously
8892035 we are in this motorsports business for the long term the opportunity to buy a modern race track below replacement cost in a market with incredible growth potential was simply too good to pass up while we expect some short term loss this is a significant investment in the future that better positions us to compete in this industry and will pay off with long term gains when the nascar sprint cup series is added to kentucky speedways event calendar
8892036 we have a short list of drivers that were definitely keeping our eye on well see what plays out
8892037 as one of the original ncts sponsors our team ase racing program has served the organization well since 1994 but our board has decided that its time to redirect those resources

8892087 estamos cansados de las pol ticas de exclusi n asumidas por el se or mauricio macri y el desfinanciamiento de la educaci n a nivel nacional las cuales nos arrojan a la deserci n escolar y nos dificultan la asistencia a clase
8892088 una clara medida a estas pol ticas elitistas es el recorte de m s del 50 en las becas estudiantiles siendo stas un subsidio por parte del estado que deber a garantizar que aquellos estudiantes que no cuenten con los recursos necesarios puedan acceder a una educaci n digna sin ser esto una traba
8892089 frente al reclamo leg timo de los estudiantes el gobierno no hace m s que cerrarnos las puertas y lanza una solicitada con el fin de amedrentarnos y callar nuestra lucha pero nunca da soluciones ni respuestas

8892103 i dont believe it the crowd is actually cheering the extreme attorneys

8892140 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it sounds not rational
8892141 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8892142 the oddity of this convention is that its central figure is the ultimate self made man a dazzling mysterious gatsby the palpable apprehension is that the anointed is a stranger a deeply engaging elegant brilliant stranger with whom the democrats had a torrid affair having slowly woken up they see the ring and wonder who exactly they married last night

8892145 we were pained at the loss of abayomi ogundeji i can not personally describe him because i have not met him face to face i have never spoken to him but the account that we hear is that he was a professional to the core a news man and writer and was a gifted editor
8892146 we all miss him but we pray that god will give us the strength to get to the root of the killing and solve the matter so that it will not occur again to any of us
8892147 im still in shock and disbelief but god knows the best we pray for his soul that the almighty god will grant him eternal mercy and rest
8892148 we dont want the family and the children to suffer i have already spoken with thisday and we have agreed to work together to set up the foundation and i will appeal to the rest of his colleagues to support so that the little children he left behind can attain greater heights in life
8892149 the level of insecurity is alarming and the perpetrators are not caught and punished this sends fear down the spine of the rest of us we hope the police will do the right thing

8892164 he couldnt mention martin he couldnt mention the civil rights movement he couldnt mention those who sacrificed and gave so much
8892165 its very very difficult to actually create a new world if you dont acknowledge the world from which you are emerging
8892166 thats the promise of america the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
8892167 but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education keep our water clean and our toys safe invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology
8892168 our government should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work
8892169 tonight i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8892170 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own out of work tough luck no health care the market will fix it born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own

8892173 i understand a bunch of these teams are going to start making moves if they dont hear from him
8892174 probably by about the end of the month they are going to start making some plan bs and he knows that he has known that since july 1 really any of these teams could have changed their minds at any point in time theres nothing in holding them back to do that

8892213 at 22 12 2005 a brave group of wankers went to dustwallow marsh to face onyxia sister of nefarian daughter of blackwing they went here to revenge the terror onyxia has put on the alliance for quite a while full of confidence the group who called themselves the aunans entered the lair they slayed without any trouble the finest guardians onyxia gathered and went without any trouble to her hide out facing the impressive dragon the once so confident aunans became insecure and a bit frightened but reminded by the promise they made to highlord boldovar they choose to fight instead to run the aunans had appointed a warrior to get her attention while the rest would try to kill her this tactic seemed to work and onyxia became weaker by the minute aunans confidence was rising again and they begin to think they would actually get her on her knees but after a while onyxia noticed that she had underestimated her opponents and she decided to attack the aunans from the air she called up on her children to help her fight the noble alliance scared by this sudden move the aunans gathered up into a group trying to find the safety that company of more people can offer however when onyxia saw this happen she took a deep breath and fill the cave with fire the aunans where supprised and many were heavily injured they retreated but they were not defeated the aunans treated the casualties and gathered once more to attack her meanwhile onyxia has called new wardens to protect her from the alliance but even they where no match for the might of the aunans and after a couple of minutes they were facing onyxia again but they made the same mistakes as the first attack and where forced to retreat again aunans did not gave up and tried again but they failed once more but at the 4th try they seemed to survive onyxia while she was flying in the air and weakened her with magic spells bullets and arrows onyxia became fed up and landed to face the alliance she let the ground shake lava came out of the floor her attacks became stronger and just when she was about to fall on her knees the aunans where forcred to retreat again but this time they knew she could be defeated so the aunans entered the cave once more more confident than before more certain of their abilities they slayed the new wardens again and faced onyxia and this time everything went according to plan onyxia tried and tried but she couldnt defeat the alliance wall and after a a while she couldnt bare the alliance attacks and fell down dead the aunans where excited and proud but the biggest suprise was yet to come in the stomach of onyxia they found 2 magical helms a book wich probally belonged to a warlock and through wich they can summon a skeleton and a bag wich at first sight never ended the aunans took the head of onyxia and traveled back to stormwind city the highlord was pleased and proud and rewarded the alliance with a tremendous award but the most unbelievable thing was about to happen when the head of onyxia was raised every alliance in the neighborhood of the head was hit by lightning and became stronger than before and the aunans looked up on each other and they knew it is time to kill some more bad guys

8892222 i felt like i wanted to vomit when i seen that the reason why i called him a sellout is because i feel he did that for a publicity look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him how could you want john mccain in office when george bush and the republicans already have half a million people losing their homes in foreclosure were fighting an unjust war its the latinos and black kids up in the front lines fighting that war we over here trying to take the troops out of iraq and bring peace this guy immediately wants war if not with iraq or afghanistan hell start a new one with iran i feel real disgusted that daddy yankee would do that either he did that for a look or hes just not educated on politics

8892273 the ban on police being able to question suspects after they have been charged would be scrapped in measures announced yesterday to increase the number of people being convicted
8892274 these plans are of course are presented as a way of cutting police red tape this is quite misleading after all the police are not being freed of excessive reporting requirements or sanctioned detection targets in the proposed reforms cutting superfluous bureaucracy is not the same as eliminating necessary safeguards on the bright side more sinister plans for routinely harassing the general public seem to have been shelved
8892275 a non custodial sentence for sexual offences against a child under 13 where the child had been a willing participant did not meet the essential fact that the law was there not only to protect children from the baleful influence of adults with an inappropriate interest in children but was also designed to protect children from themselves
8892276 hes been singing a lot of songs and he didnt sing before
8892277 it gives the parents a lot of hope to see a lot of love out there for them and their child

8892279 everything we gave him to eat he threw away i think he was scared of it

8892293 the principles set out by the house of lords in norwich pharmacal co v customs and excise commissioners 1974 ac 133 could be applied in novel circumstances to require the foreign secretary to disclose information specific to the claimant and essential to his defence to serious charges which might carry the death penalty in confidence to lawyers representing him in proceedings at guantanamo bay given that the conduct of the security service of the united kingdom had amounted to being involved in arguable wrongdoing by facilitating interviews of the claimant by or on behalf of the united states of america while the claimant had been held unlawfully in incommunicado detention and on his case had been subject to alleged torture and cruel inhuman or degrading treatment at the hands of the detaining authorities

8892301 right now we are supporting the ps3 launch we are really excited to be bringing the bioshock experience to a whole new set of fans weve been concentrating on ways to make this game special the things that weve added theyre not changing the original experience that the 360 fans and the pc fans got but are things that compliment nicely that experience
8892302 the answer is no right now this is a ps3 exclusive
8892303 games are globally recognized as a genre of entertainment and the industry is attracting much attention for its market size and growth potential but on the other hand the japanese game industry is facing a turning point as to whether or not we can stay at the core of the global market
8892304 theyre giving them unique offers they wouldnt have had otherwise
8892305 so the consumer is smiling as theyre getting out because theyre redeeming an average of two offers per trip
8892306 the consumer is now buying more because theyre getting relevant offers that encourage them to buy what they might not have bought otherwise
8892307 ive seen this technology come up in the past i dont know whether it was the technology or usability but it drove customers out of the stores
8892308 things like this need to be extremely easy to use
8892309 we dummied it down to make it easier to save time
8892310 it was too complex before too powerful therefore it was not adopted
8892311 we do have in some stores kind of in the area of natural foods some tv screens that talk about eating properly and things like that
8892312 there are some mommy tips but thats just hit or miss and not in many stores
8892313 you can get an overall snapshot and it will tell you if youre high or low on specific nutritional attributes
8892314 for instance it will tell you if it looks like youre consuming too much sodium
8892315 you can drill down to figure out what youve purchased
8892316 if youre looking for cereal thats low in sugar and high in fiber it will help you find that with foodflex initially when you sign up you provide certain information about your family how many people matters in calculating what youre buying
8892317 the first challenge was crossing the chasm getting over the big hurdle of having one retailer spend millions of dollars in putting it into hundreds of stores
8892318 seeing that the benefits are real theyre now expanding the program and stop amp shop will roll it out to more stores
8892319 ive been round long enough to take nothing for granted particularly in a two horse race
8892320 wembley is renowned for upsets just look at featherstone against hull in 1983 and mighty wigan who came unstuck against sheffield in 1998
8892321 probably the biggest disappointment of my career was in the 2002 final at murrayfield no one gave wigan a prayer but they turned up on the day and we didnt
8892322 hull have had a nightmare year with injuries but wembley is their pinnacle and their whole season hinges on this match but we know if we play to our ability we will win
8892323 i remember going to warrington and seeing a sculpture of brian bevan in the middle of the roundabout near their old wilderspool ground
8892324 its a strange feeling to be immortalised in bronze but its nice to be erected whilst im still breathing many statues go up after someones death
8892325 the sculptress has already been up from cornwall and taken my vital statistics apparently its going to be one and a half times lifesize
8892326 its obviously an incredible honour just as is playing in eight cup finals never in my wildest dreams in 1996 did i think id appear in so many

8892333 while its something we could have done without in the long term it wont cause a big issue
8892334 we are anxious to see delivery of the regeneration of the whole city centre and this is an important scheme within that
8892335 the april date was probably a little artificial but i think we should look forward and this is an excellent scheme now that will bring lots of lots of people down to the river
8892336 thats what we do thats what people in communities do
8892337 i didnt have a sense that there would be a change
8892338 we were really handcuffed because we were tied up in juneau
8892339 it was probably one race i didnt take for granted i was probably more nervous because of being gone
8892340 i will never look at politics the same way again
8892341 ill continue to do what i think got me to the point im at which is to answer phone calls and e mails
8892342 we went back to them to ask if we could lease it
8892343 im glad how some things really do work out for the better
8892344 my initial objection to selling was losing control of this land im glad it went from 40 to 20 acres and im glad if the group goes defunct we regain control of it
8892345 theyre just going out of their way to help us
8892346 well probably give rides at the airport as long as we leave enough facilities there
8892347 hopefully we can flip the switch off on the one property in the fall of 2009 and switch it on at the other the next spring
8892348 when we came to where were at right now at the airport it was hurry up and throw down the tracks now we can take a step back and plan a little
8892349 a person doesnt have to be a railroad person to get involved
8892350 we need pickup trucks and flatbeds and forklifts oh man i dont know what all this is going to take
8892351 i know hes allen had a discussion or two about dan handing over the reins
8892352 i know zip other than people calling me and wanting to know whats going on
8892353 he has been offered some things he has been doing in the past but not chief
8892354 hell contini be able to make a good decision thats best for him and the fire department
8892355 he should retire when he wants to hes the youngest 74 year old i know
8892356 he could see fire as a tool not always an enemy he didnt come to your aid unless you wanted it
8892357 these new guys want to keep you safe when you dont want to be saved
8892358 i still go to him if i have problems with the city
8892359 he built the fire service area from the ground up the respect for him is printed on the building
8892360 something like what happened up on the parks highway will be a much higher bill than somebody in an accident who has to have the door popped open
8892361 they dont pay taxes yet we have to spend the money to put their fire out for them
8892362 when they come in the mail i stick them in the file and they go to the attorney
8892363 my first y we didnt have a building and i worked out of the back of my bronco
8892364 we went into schools and worked in the offices of other organizations if we needed them from a program standpoint thats how new ys start
8892365 we are really excited to finally see the mighty phace and misanthrop machine set free upon the world set free because neosignal means no more compromise nobody to answer to a product a brand which is theirs from start to finish autonomy time to push boundaries
8892366 funked out rolling badness from phace this track is gonna be in my box for a long while to come its the perfect combination of a deep nasty dancefloor killer timeless
8892367 in his debut release for neosignal phace delivers another top of the range 12
8892368 probably my favourite track by phace evar a very untypical phace track one might say cause its so riff driven and progresses in a more subtle and dosed way than most genre counterparts it does things ive never heard a phace tune do before and yet still its undeniably phace but the most important reason why its such a standout tune is because its got so much heart so much more than most current techy d amp b its like hearing music youve been wanting to hear for a long time leaving you wondering why arent there more tracks like this and the answer is simple because magic like this doesnt happen often
8892369 neosignals first release brings the long awaited cold champagne rollers dont come much slicker than this phace bring the phunk with style once again killer every time and sick to mix massive support from the lifted camp
8892370 cold champagne brings back the phace funk from yesteryears a resurrected cut from their earlier days gets a face lift and delivers a tight blend of old phace with the new deep driving and introspective a must for any djs box whos willing to dig deeper
8892371 this is phace doing what they do best stomping driving twisting turning appealing to that part of your brain that only phace seem to know how to get to serious for me the best part about this tune is the fantastic switch from the brilliantly unusual levitating pad solo into a relentless persuasive groove that manages to breathe as much as it kicks and so the bar is set higher once again
8892372 we are really excited to finally see the mighty phace and misanthrop machine set free upon the world

8892375 if there is a moment in my career where i regret a decision it was clearly the day after the fa cup final when my agent told me club x wants you tomorrow and i told him no i love it here and i dont want to go i want to stay
8892376 thats the moment i regret after that day after that final i should have left chelsea and i would have the chance in wembley to say goodbye to the fans and to say goodbye to english football
8892377 so thats a moment i regret because the next season lasted only a couple of months
8892378 i only have friends in chelsea and i have problems with nobody but if i stayed there one two three four more weeks probably in this moment i wouldnt say this
8892379 however the results of the market feasibility study should help push the project along

8892389 like a trip into my personal hell to a certain extent
8892390 i felt that we needed a lot less keyboards and there was just going to be more punching to the face type of thing
8892391 the whole vibe seems fresh cause the direction we had with the last album we couldnt go further so the album sonically is a bit more sparse thats the direction were heading heavier doomier and gloomier and its great to tour that kind of stuff
8892392 all the bands are kind of crossover in what they do thats really interesting
8892393 this is the first kind of traveling festival type of thing weve done cause they dont have anything like that back in europe so its exciting
8892394 thats one of the reasons we wanted to be there
8892395 in this one we have a bit longer songs so arrangement wise theres more differences within the song
8892396 we wanted that contrast having really nice beautiful melodies and then having that really crunchy guitar thing in there so to have the balance between the right and wrong so to speak
8892397 the idea to have nine songs was based on dantes inferno cause hell has nine layers so its like going deeper down into hell and then coming back
8892398 there are so many different vibes and moods in the album that its cool once you listen to it again because you cant absorb everything with one listen
8892399 we recorded the album during the winter so that could be one of the reasons it sounds a bit gloomy and doomy its always dark and super cold
8892400 one of my mates from here in l a committed suicide two and a half years ago and thats a tribute to him
8892401 its about how it is on the other side and how we react to it on this side just a young guy who had the world everything is possible but deep depression and too many drugs cause you to do stupid things so the subject matter is not light on the album but its good to get this out its cathartic
8892402 there are a couple of tunes that are too close to me personally i cant talk about so its better to leave that stuff open for interpretation
8892403 this one we were like lets just have a lot of fun and play as loud as we can
8892404 and most of the songs were originally on guitars so i was playing riffs differently it was just me playing my telecaster through a fuzz box and rocking out
8892405 nobody can say the albums not heavy or that its not emotional or not melodic
8892406 its got everything were all about and thats where we are now as a band
8892407 we wanted to push everything about the band further than ever
8892408 we wanted the heavy parts to be as heavy as anything weve done and at the same time we wanted to go full force with ideas weve never even approached
8892409 its totally us but it comes from a musically more mature place
8892410 you can really hear us pushing ourselves to make everything as good as we possibly could
8892411 that song is about the struggle of every day life and trying to deal with it and get your shit together
8892412 life is all about good and bad and its important to realize that in order to keep your anity
8892413 when we finished the demo for that song we were all amazed
8892414 its so different for us but its so cool and it was the first indication that this record was going to be everything we wanted it to be
8892415 we were doing whatever we felt like the whole time and at one point i went dude i really want some horns somewhere on the record
8892416 i really like bands like rocket from the crypt so we put them in there and theyre tight and punchy and really help keep the song interesting
8892417 i think ive always wanted to do a country ballad
8892418 we did everything we wanted to accomplish on this album its leaps and bounds from where we were this is us saying loud and clear that we can and will write and do whatever feels good to us
8892419 it has been a long time since someone made a big epic hard rock song and that one definitely came from guitarist dan jacobs
8892420 he has always been big time into 80s rock and metal and this time we took that stuff and made it bigger than life
8892421 i was screaming for three records straight and it was time to bring in some new elements
8892422 i did that a little bit on our last album a death grip on yesterday but i didnt have the right tools for this i worked hard and practiced my ass off i dont have god given talent my talent is in my determination ill just try fucking hard and suck at something for a while until i finally get it right
8892423 i made it a point to sit down and write every single day
8892424 whether it was a single riff a full song or nothing of importance i just came up with as much as i could
8892425 it looked like it was purposeful it was going very fast
8892426 i dont know if he the driver fell asleep but there were no brakes
8892427 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to cease all zoom operations it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8892428 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a re financing package that would have kept our aircraft flying even as late as yesterday we had secured a new investment package but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying the collapse of zoom is a result of matter beyond our control
8892429 there are a number of ground support agencies and services as well as the airport authority that are owed some funds from zoom so the aircraft is on the ground in calgary pending resolution with zoom and the leaseholder as well as the creditors

8892491 it is regrettable that former governor warner has chosen to deny virginians that opportunity by declining this statewide broadcast opportunity

8892531 some arrestees who could not make their own bond spent 6 7 8 or more hours waiting at taps before being transferred to court
8892532 the only access we were given to those clients was to whisper

8892641 im not generally an alarmist but i am really really concerned about this country
8892642 starting in 1998 there was such a shift in silicon valley toward chasing money and short term returns
8892643 in some ways we have the problem that it looks like innovation is flourishing but too much of it is short term incremental innovation
8892644 what venture capitalists should do is start taking more risks again
8892645 taking risks and failing is one of the most critical aspects of innovation

8892648 relationships are very very important to me and make a big impression on my wine buying decisions
8892649 if im choosing between two premium wines and one guy is taking pains to have a relationship with me you can bet thats the guy im going to do business with
8892650 one of the biggest reasons i do business with mondavi is because of the relationship with him and his people
8892651 this does well at the restaurant because its good wine at a good value with a well known name behind it
8892652 thats never been more important than now when people are less open to experimentation and more into drinking the brands that they trust
8892653 he knows his customer better than anyone else and distributors and people like me need to understand that and cater to that
8892654 people will experiment with new food and wine in a restaurant first
8892655 if they like it they will buy it and drink it at home and serve it to their guests restaurateurs like bobby are very important to my business
8892656 im looking for wines that people can drink on a daily basis by building my vertical lists
8892657 i want to have high profile wines on my list but i also have to have wines that customers will drink every day in this economy people are not going to spend 100 to 150 on a bottle of wine every day theyre looking for more value
8892658 the competition among wineries is so fierce now theres no room for mediocre wines at any price point
8892659 thats driving up prices for even mediocre wines from napa
8892660 there are so many great wines coming in from across the world you almost have to overdeliver today to compete
8892661 going to wineries is like going on rides some are really great wines and others are just mediocre
8892662 our head count is up but our sales are off
8892663 restaurants are cutting their wine list we have to be sure we keep our position on the list
8892664 the wines are very good and the sales show is a hoot
8892665 im tasting and reading about wines nearly every day that i want him to try we go out and try and meet with the winemakers and understand what theyre trying to do
8892666 i can tell you my belief is caf lucci has dramatically grown the revenue in the restaurant because of the wine
8892667 i think bobby has one of the top five lists in all of chicago
8892668 people want to try whats new out there and they expect me to know
8892669 the package is aimed at getting voters attention in anticipation of the next election
8892670 its definitely positive but to what extent is the question
8892671 weve been calling this a shallow recession and the data today tend to support that view
8892672 but that doesnt mean they point toward a quicker recovery either
8892673 going forward whether core measures of cpi excluding food and energy would show signs of inflation would be the key factor in determining the actions

8892685 when you have monetary tightening you do get lower growth that was expected
8892686 but its not terribly low 7 9 percent is still high by historical standards
8892687 our economy must grow at the rate of at least ten per cent every year to get rid of poverty and generate employment for all
8892688 until we can achieve those reforms 10 percent remains an unattainable target
8892689 the basic idea is that we use three things the fluorocarbon a silicon based hydrogen source and a catalyst which mediates between the two to replace the fluorine in the fluorocarbon with hydrogen

8893170 he was here in early spring and committed to me during a meeting that the department of fisheries and oceans would be looking to make changes in how nova scotia seal hunters could be licensed to make it easier for new hunters to get licenses since that commitment ive heard nothing from ottawa
8893171 its a big step forward to have the department of fisheries doing this i give the minister full credit for speaking out publicly in the media about the need to reduce the grey seal numbers and the need to do it on sable island we do need the higher quota and we do need access to sable island thats where the big herd is at and where its concentrated
8893172 as long as they say that publicly its very difficult to gain acceptance from the general public around the world about the need to reduce the numbers the scientists continue to ignore the impact of parasites in fish that come from grey seals that we know are killing the fish we have fishermen who are observing spawning fish being chased off spawning grounds by large number of grey seals

8893210 hi my family and i have returned from egypt where we spent 2 weeks at sharm el sheik at the name of hotel i had my mother 2 sons and partner with me and we were all affected by an illness with symptoms ranging from severe daihorrea sickness muscle and joint pain and feeling really unwell i am at home now but we are all mostly still suffering symptoms with my partner being admitted to hospital and both of us having to be off work for the past fortnight my partner and 2 sons also had henna tattoos done inside a shop within the grounds of our hotel but they have swollen up and are badly inflammed and leaking fluids not very nice at all as i think they will be scarred for life i would appreciate any guidance from anyone my partner has been to a doctor and hospital i was supposed to but i cant afford anymore time off work thanks
8893211 egypt has featured very highly this year as one of the most problematic destinations this call for assistance represents the desparation that many holidaymakers find themselves in often having to live with the difficult consequences when they return to the uk such examples nail the lie that change of climate or too much sun is the cause of holiday sickness the time has come for maturity in holiday contracts the time has come for government and the eu commission to act
8893212 i am finding it very difficult to claim back money from a holiday me and my girlfriend had recently at the above hotel i have letters ive sent to major tour operator who have then palmed me off to a solicitors and are basically not listening to any of my comments we have medical reports that state the horrible illness we both had on holiday is identification of source and the same is happening to a lot of people a ridiculous amount the hotel has a serious problem major tour operator have recently had to settle another load of claims based around this same problem at the same hotel which date back to 2000 2002 surely this is gross negligence
8893213 the fact that problems continue to exist at this hotel is of deep concern to holidaytravelwatch i am concerned that clients are being subjected to the helpful assistance of tour companies solicitors i am also concerned that tour companies are working quickly to compensate clients often at levels below normal levels of compensation and it appears without advising the recipient that they should seek independent advices two issues arise firstly the eu commission and uk parliament when amending the package travel directive should introduce a pre action protocol for holiday claims which must be followed whether a client is represented or not secondly the issue of standards and aggravated damages must also be addressed within any new regulatory regime
8893214 the behaviour of the fundamentalists and communal groups has rejected our constitution they have no regard for human rights for constitutional rights for freedom of conscience our people are feeling very insecure there they are running away and their houses are being burnt by these people
8893215 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
8893216 good politicians like good scientists draw conclusions from facts bad politicians like bad scientists draw facts from conclusions
8893217 but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough

8893221 we would have liked ideally that this matter be handed over to the cbi because those responsible should get justice immediately as judicial probe takes longer time
8893222 the prime minister in fact spoke to the chief minister and the governor and assured the state government that it would give whatever help needed to bring back normalcy
8893223 there is no role for the central government it is for the state government to decide

8893225 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president

8893228 more than two months after ra 9504 was signed workers have yet to feel the benefit of said law
8893229 these will negate the tax relief granted under republic act 9504
8893230 the minimum wage earners entire earnings and not just the excess are proposed to be subject to income tax and withholding tax thereby discouraging productivity
8893231 in reducing the amount of exemptions the draft regulations effectively deprives individuals the benefit of the law contrary to the intent of congress and in violation of existing jurisprudence
8893232 uphold the rule of law and provide immediate relief to all workers in these economically trying times
8893233 we believe that it is only through the proper and complete implementation of ra 9504 that the government will be able to immediately directly and equitably provide the much needed economic relief to all workers as it had intended
8893234 definitely on a holiday weekend we see more fatalities and motor vehicle collisions

8893240 zardari has misled key stakeholders in pak polity to push himself to presidency
8893241 the concern is not about his political right to contest the election but about the way he has adopted the tactics that he is using the misleading claims broken promises petty politicking unauthorised name dropping and other tactics to achieve his political ambitions
8893242 i have it from the horses mouth that zardari had misled many of his political allies and partners by claiming that the establishment which mediated and guaranteed many deals had expressed serious reservations about the restoration of the judges especially chief justice iftikhar mohammed chaudhry i have been clearly told there was no such reservation and never any one of any rank had interfered in the matter telling him what to do or not to do
8893243 likewise the perception that everyone was onboard with zardaris decision to become the president was also not true as the subject was not discussed with key stakeholders political and apolitical causing irritation and concern among many concerned quarters
8893244 this one man show cannot sustain as one person cannot physically be the party head de facto pm de jure president party strategist economic czar wheeler and dealer manpower manager political mastermind this all in one approach was detrimental to the country
8893245 this wily petty politics is untenable and unacceptable at the level where he has risen a strong sense of moral uprightness is needed and a man who openly proves that he does not stand by his promises can hardly make a claim to be the head of the state zardari has to quickly correct this image if he is to be taken seriously
8893246 why do you say so i replied because you will not be able to handle it because it will be too much for everyone to swallow and digest so quickly because if you fail you will bring the entire political system down
8893247 me and my family were big gary glitter fans and when we saw him floating on the sea on a lilo we were like wow
8893248 the next day i built a big sandcastle and asked him to come and look at it as kids do he was really friendly i didnt think anything of it but when i look at the photo now i get really creeped out
8893249 its worrying to think what was going through his mind
8893250 you can see in the picture hes grabbing hold of my thigh and has his arms around me he would kiss us and hug us
8893251 my parents were there all the time but we had no idea he was a paedophile it was before he was arrested
8893252 it terrifies me to think what might have happened if i had been left with him
8893253 my parents are really responsible and wouldnt have left me alone with someone we didnt know
8893254 but gary was being really friendly and lots of people would have trusted him i felt safe with him we never felt threatened we just thought he was a great guy the last thing id have thought is that he was a sexual predator
8893255 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
8893256 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8893257 what the people heard people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one

8893259 this is history i will tell my grandchildren about this
8893260 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have

8893262 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8893263 i worked on the hillary clinton campaign for a year and ive come to the realization that hes the one to change this country
8893264 but lets hope that americans are going to address the problems that are bedeviling the country
8893265 i dont mind it ageing a bit i love my gray hair

8893267 such a high percentage of polarization means you really have to have very good conditions a magnetic field that is very ordered
8893268 but once you get away from the pulsar then you get a much more complex situation because the field begins to break up into little patches and knots
8893269 pulsars and their surrounding regions are examples of physics under extreme conditions anything you can do to learn about how they work helps us understand the basic physics of particle acceleration and magnetic field generation

8893275 this is tragic they call this a map but it is so inadequate it has not been interpreted in any way it has no landmarks on it
8893276 the public need to know that what theyre getting on google is not accurate and isnt up to date

8893283 nothing the security arrangements by many accounts were outstanding ficas the federation of international cricketers associations chief is supposed to have told the pcb pakistan cricket board that they were the best arrangements he had seen the asia cup was held recently without so much as a beep on the many metal detectors and scanners placed at stadiums no the question is not what pakistan could have done for they did everything
8893284 when they speak off the record theyre so fucking disrespectful of other countries many of them are complete xenophobes
8893285 pakistan needed to host the champions trophy the second most important odi tournament in the game to put some feelgood back in the air an opportunity to show that it still matters pakistan needed to show itself and see itself in headlines that didnt have the words terrorist and al qaeda in them

8893311 we are definitely in a better position compared to last season if you look at our squad especially if you consider our strength in depth you have to have depth in your squad to do well in this league it allows you to make changes which can change games
8893312 i think the extra competition probably makes the players work harder as places are up for grabs for every match and no one wants to lose the shirt
8893313 to beat torquay and stevenage both with clean sheets is a great result and i have to give the credit to the players i have been fairly happy since the start of the season to be fair we have had a tough start but i would have taken two wins two draws and a defeat over five games at the start of the season

8893349 i am aware that there is a draft bilateral economic and trade cooperation agreement between our two countries that is awaiting finalisation and signing
8893350 the economic and trade integration of africa is paramount to the development and prosperity of our continent
8893351 i will recall that our two countries are active members of the african union and comesa and are champions of the african integration
8893352 with president kagame you share the same views of the development of the two nations and you are determined to free your people from poverty
8893353 encouraged by these strong ties your support and the commitment of all the services of your country i am confident that i will be able to carry out my important mission in the kingdom of swaziland
8893354 camar o que dorme a onda leva minha filha que trabalha nos estados unidos est no rio e me chamou para ir praia como eu poderia ir com o vasco ainda perto da zona do rebaixamento
8893355 sou f daquela sele o italiana vai ser um desafio fazer o time do vasco ter mais posse de bola que o advers rio desse jeito mais f cil chegar ao gol
8893356 dos 20 clubes do brasileiro o vasco o que tem pior ndice de passes e menos posse de bola tamb m o que menos finaliza mas o que mais acerta o alvo
8893357 nos ltimos quatro jogos sofremos apenas dois gols a defesa est mais s lida o time mais compacto e j n o h aqueles espa os entre os setores

8893359 we will be offering this to people with a body mass index bmi that shows they are getting towards obese
8893360 they will be able to take a 12 week voucher to attend a class if they lose five per cent of their body weight they can come back for another voucher
8893361 at the moment we will be offering it to people over the age of 45 but it could be opened up to everybody for people in later life their weight is a key issue because it can lead to problems with blood pressure and diabetes
8893362 we have a preliminary budget but it may expand or shrink before the contracts are finalised so i dont want to discuss the funding at this stage
8893363 ive never been much of a rugby fan i always preferred football but i knew there wasnt much out there to help people practise on their own
8893364 o tel o pode ag entar duas toneladas por um metro quadrado por isso uma dan a com dez mil pessoas em cima dele n o traz problema algum
8893365 fizemos muitos esfor os para reduzir o mais poss vel o tempo usado neste processo
8893366 they told me that ian had been in a car accident with my fiat i didnt even know he knew how to drive
8893367 they said it ended in a fatality it ended in the death of ian i broke down i couldnt walk or talk it was the first time ive ever left him on his own
8893368 he had left the lights on and the television so we dont know where he was going and we are never going to know now
8893369 im devastated because we were very very close he would talk about anything we were just so close
8893370 he got up and i came out of my bedroom and he hadnt seen my dress and i hadnt seen his suit and he said i looked like a princess ill never forget it i cried my eyes out
8893371 pequim fez muito para os jogos paraol mpicos em termos da constru o civil o que permite que os portadores de necessidades especiais saibam mais sobre o avan o social desta cidade

8893374 il mio cuore sar a madrid e a marsiglia la juve so poco di loro
8893375 i wasnt upset by the way it ended just by what was going on
8893376 i have got absolutely no problem with west brom as a football club with the supporters the players or the staff just one person and a few people who work for him
8893377 you will never hear me mention his name i dont want to sulley this by talking about him
8893378 i dont think i will ever get over how i think he treated me and my family but i dont want to mention any more about it because this is about football
8893379 i dont need it i have huge respect for them i have some great memories of those fantastic supporters and i hope the club can kick on for their sake because they really are top drawer
8893380 it is a fantastic football club and i had great times when i was there i got on fantastically with the supporters and they were fantastic to me
8893381 but it is only now we were able to start in earnest with a view to completing the shops and as many apartments lofts as possible prior to christmas this year
8893382 all of the hard work that has been put into this project and the length of time it has taken to get it to this point is a testimony to the public and private sectors working together to achieve benefit for the community
8893383 this development is in a premium location in hednesford and strong benefits will ensue for the community it will be a benefit to all
8893384 it is pleasing to see the patience of hednesford shoppers rewarded with this start on what will be the first of a number of regeneration schemes designed to re invigorate the town centre
8893385 at the moment i have got nothing to report in the way of progress weve got several lines of enquiry which we are actively pursuing
8893386 i want to be optimistic that we can sign one if not two new players but its a game of poker especially with the deadline looming
8893387 like all good poker players you have to keep a straight face hold your cards close to your chest and try not to show that youre panicking like crazy inside
8893388 i anticipate a long weekend supporters should be aware that it could go to the wire
8893389 theres absolutely no chance of anyone getting a kightly hennessey or any of the other players youve all been writing about this summer
8893390 we see this proposal in the context of other major public art structures commissioned in recent years such as gatesheads the angel of the north nottingham universitys aspire manchesters b of the bang and dublins millennium spire
8893391 one way leads to diamonds one way leads to gold another leads you only to everything your told in your heart you wonder which of these is true the road that leads to nowhere the road that leads to you
8893392 i have never questioned whether this is true or not
8893393 did you finish breakfast yet and who left that mess upstairs anyway you need to put down that spoon and go and clean your room
8893394 but you just told me to finish my cereal should i clean my room first and then finish my cereal itll get soggy
8893395 thats right itll be soggy and itll be ruined thats why you should just sit and concentrate on eating your cereal
8893396 kids i need some help today i dont know how to make good decisions so i need you guys to decide what we can do today
8893397 that included role players within our own government as well as the governments of pakistan saudi arabia and israel each played a compartmentalized role in order to create a climate of fear and confusion

8893402 il nostro quarto album e volevamo fare qualcosa di diverso ha dichiarato paul gray non si possono scrivere album tutti uguali allo stesso tempo questo album racchiude tutto ci che rappresentano gli slipknot
8893403 non vedo lora di vedere che faccia far la gente quando ascolter il nuovo disco afferma invece taylor ci sono cose davvero molto pesanti in questalbum e lasceranno tutti a bocca aperta ma sono anche eccitato per tutto ci che di diverso c in questo disco il suo lato pi sperimentale nessuno si aspetta qualcosa del genere
8893404 pre charge advice made the biggest difference but that was a good thing because it was getting rid of cases that were going to get dropped anyway
8893405 a certain part of the reduction is as a result of conditional cautions and fixed penalty notices
8893406 substantial improvements in the criminal justice system have meant that offenders are being dealt with in the first or second hearing as opposed to a fifth or sixth

8893408 gt insanely great mac that vertex solutions and apple have announced a deal that will let apple provide its products and services to federal clients using the opm training and management assistance tma contract vehicle
8893409 were delighted to have apples government organization as part of our team
8893410 this agreement is the result of several months of discussion and i believe that this partnership will ultimately benefit tma clients by improving workforce performance using leading technologies

8893412 fiona has devoted her life to gmtv for the past 15 years and started feeling it was time to move on
8893413 she has recently been saying that 12 years of getting up at 4am is quite enough and she wants to be full of energy for her children while theyre young instead of feeling shattered all the time
8893414 she appreciates it might appear a bit bonkers to walk away but the summer break gave her time to reach a decision and she feels the time is right
8893415 the thing im most concerned about from an asian country standpoint is the increased level of inflation
8893416 these conditions can signal potential problems going forward having said that you just saw from our quarterly performance we havent experienced it yet so its more of a watch out
8893417 the announcement is a very telling example of where were headed as a company in developing targeted products for emerging countries
8893418 rather than starting in the u s this is a series of products that are going to be sold primarily in the emerging countries and then we will branch out later
8893419 i think weve taken a very bold step with these new products what we have done here is weve attempted to give smbs small and midsize businesses a product where they can scale and grow their business but do so in a very affordable way thats what theyve been asking for

8893442 cheney determined to strike in us with wmd this summer
8893443 these missiles are close to our borders and constitute a threat to us
8893444 this will create additional tension and we will have to respond to it in some way naturally using military means
8893445 to develop equipment for potential combat use against ground based ballistic missiles
8893446 russia is saying once again that has the opportunity to overcome u s missile defense
8893447 such tests are planned in advance maybe but its unlikely
8893448 experience shows the most economical and quickly achievable countermeasures against the development of a missile defense system are so called asymmetrical measures
8893449 most likely this is an old topol maybe slightly modernized
8893450 these missiles are to be stationed alongside our border and they are a threat to us we have to respond somehow to this situation and naturally enough we have to take a military response
8893451 we are very pleased with the progress and speed with which pain therapeutics and king pharmaceuticals are developing this series of four opioids licensed from us
8893452 this marks another milestone for our oradur technology as a versatile platform that provides for the controlled delivery of pharmaceuticals that are commonly abused
8893453 parkinsons is a costly disease and places a huge burden on carers and society as a whole we need governments to realise that taking action to reduce this burden by ensuring people receive the best care and treatment available makes the most economic and social sense
8893454 there are nearly 1 2 million people living with parkinsons in europe and with an ageing population this figure is set to rise its time to address inequalities in care and treatment of the disease and improve the lives of those affected by parkinsons now and in the future
8893455 it always amazes me how parkinsons is so visible socially and yet seemingly invisible to society this is a ruthless condition and help is needed throughout europe this epda initiative is crucial we need to increase understanding we need to raise the profile we need people not just to see but to act
8893456 todays figures show long term vacancy rates are continuing to fall across nearly all staff groups this is good news for patients because low vacancy rates are likely to contribute towards better continuity of care
8893457 the new experimental data in the report shows total vacancy rates and is aimed at providing a richer picture of staff vacancies in the nhs

8893460 there was a large police presence when we were told that all zoom staff had gone home and another company had to sort our luggage out for us for which we were very grateful
8893461 the upshot of this was that i was left with no alternative flights that would have got us in to penticton where the event is being held
8893462 i am now back home in bury and pretty down hearted after all the training preparation media coverage and fund raising that has all been part of this project
8893463 i will soon be in negotiation with the race director for a place at ultraman 2009
8893464 i would like to thank everyone who has put in such hard work and so much time to help raise the profile of my project i will not give up and will be back in training to compete next year
8893465 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to suspend all zoom operations it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff suffolk homes
8893466 although several groups have documented that repeated cocaine exposure increases nac spine density the precise molecular mechanisms that control this process have remained elusive
8893467 moreover the cocaine induced increase in nac spine density has been hypothesized to contribute to the long lasting behavioral sensitization that occurs after repeated cocaine exposure but direct evidence concerning the functional relationship between these two processes is lacking
8893468 taken together our findings implicate mef2 as a key regulator of structural synapse plasticity and sensitized responses to cocaine and suggest that reducing mef2 activity and thereby increasing spine density in the nac may be a compensatory mechanism to limit long lasting maladaptive behavioral responses to cocaine
8893469 a better understanding of the mef2 associated molecular mechanisms that regulate cocaine induced structural and behavioral plasticity could ultimately lead to the development of improved treatments for drug addiction
8893470 bristol myers squibb and pfizer remain enthusiastic and committed to the clinical development program for apixaban

8893493 so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8893494 specific bold solutions and optimistic vision for our nation and our childrens future

8893500 do you think obamas nomination for president represents progress for all blacks in america more generally

8893548 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8893549 its very very important that we play the way we practiced and trained over the last year and a half

8893552 obama claims to be an anti war candidate when he really is just a new face on the war of terror that bush has locked into place
8893553 hes pledged pre emptive war on iran and on pakistan hes not an anti war candidate hes pledged 14 000 more troops to the war in afghanistan and wants to keep 80 000 troops in iraq
8893554 i argued for more resources and troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
8893555 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan

8893564 the negotiation with them it was very terrible and very materialistic and was very greedy they were asking for more money and more money and more money
8893565 i think they were very greedy and i think they were trading with the blood of their sons and daughters
8893566 i just wish that the needs of the relatives namely a thirst for the truth and for justice would be attended to rather than an alleged hunger for money
8893567 so far as many relatives i know would say we would gladly repay any compensation money if we could just have our loved ones back

8893747 he certainly can talk it but can he walk it
8893748 who voted for nixon reagan bush and bush but i cant afford four more years like this
8893749 america we cannot turn back not with so much work to do not with so many children to educate and so many veterans to care for not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save not with so many families to protect and so many lives to men america we can not turn back
8893750 in retrospect we could definitely have bettered it ill say that straight up
8893751 given the time we had it is what it is

8893765 as far as local people are concerned this trunk road is unwanted and unnecessary
8893766 were opposing this scheme to put a trunk road right through the ancient and historic parish of pendoylan which will sever the ely valley which is scheduled as an area of special countryside and also contains sights of special scientific interest
8893767 this is an area of special scientific interest its an area of special natural beauty registered as such and we all know anyone of us who want to make the slightest change to our houses that that is enforced very strictly
8893768 we want to know why the rules are enforced very strictly against local inhabitants and yet the assembly government are proposing to ignore their own regulations and drive a road through this beautiful valley which will scar it forever

8893770 since track forecasts are always subject to large errors at three to five days it is simply impossible at this time to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall
8893771 it would be no surprise if rapid intensification occurred and gustav became a category 4 or 5 hurricane by 72 hours
8893772 i think everyones definitely more aware and not trying to wait until the last minute trying to be ahead of the game a little bit

8893775 i dont need to change my name and the whole giving away the bride what is the point of it
8893776 the soul mate myth is destructive because it will keep you from forming authentic relationships that have a chance to thrive instead of fail
8893777 dont marry because you think you have found your soul mate it is bound to buckle under the unbearable weight of expected perfection
8893778 it seems to me that people are looking for a clone
8893779 he supports me he believes in me marriage cant be me me me what does he get out of it
8893780 nowadays it doesnt have to be that women want to marry a doctor because she is the doctor
8893781 have fun in your 20s get a good job get married have a family that path will make some women happy but for others it wont
8893782 some people get married too quickly without really knowing each other well enough some people get married because of tax es or health insurance and other financial benefits
8893783 some people get married because they feel like its the expected thing to do or they dont want to be alone or because theyre ready to start a family
8893784 getting married is not the only life choice available for a happy life
8893785 the most important thing is that i continue to grow as a person i want to be the happiest person i can possibly be
8893786 if that means i end up staying single for the rest of my life because i havent found the right mate thats perfectly all right with me im fine with taking on the role of the hip spinster aunt to my siblings kids

8893814 sen barack obama opened his historic acceptance speech by reminding a crowded denver arena of his story
8893815 those were the words that seemed to echo off the rockies from a throng of barack obama supporters in enraptured unison as their candidate became the first biracial american to lead a major party in the presidential election
8893816 the mccain campaign set obama up as a celebrity airhead a paris hilton of wealth and elitism and he let them portray him that way and let them over reach and let them punch him again and again and then he turned around and destroyed them if the rove republicans thought they were playing with a patsy they just got a reality check

8893886 die vp ist hier komplett auf ihre gro unternehmerische klientel ausgerichtet und propagiert eine politik welche die bed rfnisse der wachsenden zahl an jungen selbstst ndigen und ein personen unternehmen vollkommen ignoriert
8893887 die wirtschaftskammer sollte eigentliche eine service einrichtung f r unternehmen sein aber gerade f r junge selbstst ndigen und ein personen unternehmen bietet sie kein entsprechendes service an eine zwangsmitgliedschaft f r die man zahlen muss ohne etwas daf r zu bekommen ist sicher nicht im sinne einer fairen politik
8893888 es ist sch n zu sehen dass vier wochen vor der wahl schlie lich auch die gr nen den handlungsbedarf in der wirtschaftspolitik erkannt haben vielleicht finden sie ja nach ihrer kritik auch noch die zeit das wort wirtschaft in ihr wahlprogramm aufzunehmen das lif hei t die gr nen auf jeden fall herzlich willkommen in der diskussion

8893896 hopefully the feds will back off in instances where people are already following these guidelines clearly there have been abuses places that served as big fronts for illegal drug dealing this will help get criminals out of medical marijuana

8893958 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
8893959 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
8893960 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
8893961 soon there will be no north or south ossetia there will be a united alania as part of russia
8893962 the situation was very volatile and a clash was likely if we pushed on
8893963 we have given way to let them back into the government house to prevent a clash all security forces have left the government compound
8893964 the army will not stage a coup the political crisis should be resolved by political means
8893965 they needed a small victorious war if it did not work out right then they can lay the blame on us make us look like an enemy and unite the country again around certain political forces why does this supposition look surprising to you i am surprised that you are surprised about the things i say it all lies on the surface
8893966 it is all being done for their person john mccain to win the elections on november 5 the us defense complex needs to have its own person in the white house john mccain
8893967 dick cheney is the prime enemy of humanity today bush is a puppet just like saakashvili
8893968 us citizens were involved in the conflict they acted so because they were ordered to act so and the only person who could give such orders to them is their leader
8893969 we have serious reasons to believe that us citizens were staying in the combat zone if it is true if facts are confirmed it would be very bad it is very dangerous and this policy is erroneous
8893970 even during the cold war during the tough opposition between the soviet union and the united states we always avoided direct clashes between our nationals not to mention military men
8893971 i was disappointed because the us administration had done nothing to stop georgia in the initial stage of the conflict interfax quoted putin as saying
8893972 at 12 oclock local time georgian troops seized a peacemaking township in the south of tskhinvali it is not us to guarantee that we are not going to attack anyone we have not attacked anyone we ask for guarantees from others so that no one would ever attack us and kill our citizens
8893973 why would anyone conduct long standing negotiations looking for complicated compromises in ethnic conflicts it is a lot easier to arm one of the feuding sides and push it towards murdering the people of the other side done it seems to be such an easy decision to make as it turns out in reality it does not happen so always
8893974 medvedev was aware of my opinion on the matter but it was only the president of the russian federation the supreme commander in chief mr medvedev who could make such a decision
8893975 are we supposed to let someone kill us and they would keep us in lets say the group of eight
8893976 you and me are sitting here and talking in the city of sochi us warships with missiles on board have arrived in the black sea being several hundreds of kilometers away from here the range of their missiles is exactly several hundreds of kilometers these are not our warships approaching our shores these are your warships approaching our shores
8893977 we do not want any complications we do not want to argue with anyone nor do we want to wage wars against anyone we want to conduct a normal cooperation and see a respectful attitude to us and our interests
8893978 the group of eight is an inferior organization in its current state it is impossible to imagine the normal development of the world economy without inviting the peoples republic of china or india
8893979 i think that one should not think about it and one should not frighten anyone with it it is not frightening at all one should only try to analyze the situation properly look into the future and establish normal relations treating each others interests with respect
8893980 we want to live in peace and consent we want to work normally in all directions on the international security disarmament anti terrorist and anti drug struggle on the iranian and north korean nuclear issue we are ready for all of this
8893981 but we want this work to be honest open based on partnership not selfishness
8893982 if no one wants to talk to us on these issues and if cooperation with russia is not required at this point well they can work there alone for gods sake
8893983 as for the perception of the events in south ossetia by the general public it largely depends on how politicians can manipulate the media and how they can affect the public opinion in the world our us colleagues are definitely a lot better at that than we are
8893984 he the host was constantly interrupting her as soon as he did not like what she was saying he began to interrupt her he started to cough and croak he was ready to poop his pants and do it so expressively to make them break off is this the honest and objective presentation of information is this what they call information no this is not this is misinformation

8893989 mobile working can liberate people by giving them more flexibility over their time and more control over their jobs both are important in helping to make modern life less stressful as with any technology people can experience problems with mobile devices if they dont take note of simple practical steps such as those developed by bt business before they begin to use their equipment
8893990 mobile and flexible working has transformed both business and personal lives by observing a few general principles workers can ensure they see all the benefits of mobile working without any downside businesses need to be aware of their legal responsibility for the health and safety of employees wherever they are working
8893991 there has been a lack of advice for employees about best practice mobile working despite the explosion in mobile and remote working in the uk this is why we have teamed up with leading ergonomist margaret hanson to produce the advice within
8893992 burns patients need to have their bandages changed three times a week for up to two months and this is a very painful experience
8893993 the children are already anxious when they arrive at the hospital because they know the procedure is going to hurt
8893994 however we know that pain perception has a strong psychological component that can be overcome with appropriate preparation and distraction
8893995 it was important that the product took only seconds to engage the child and it was also important that the distraction lasted 20 minutes about the length of time it usually takes a nurse to replace burns bandaging
8893996 the whole form of the toy is the interface it has a touch screen and vibrating handles

8894051 people in my country have forgotten the importance of learning through play and other unstructured experiences for children
8894052 todays children are more worldly wise and technologically capable but in my opinion they are not as emotionally stable as the children of yesteryear
8894053 television had not been introduced and children had time to play with toys read books and play imaginary games which involved climbing running and crouching as they hid from others jumping and playing with balls marbles tops skipping ropes dolls matchbox cars blackboards with coloured chalks were their toys
8894054 todays parents lead a different life from their forebears most mothers work and many rely on others to take their children to and from school to cook to wash and iron the familys clothes and to oversee homework
8894055 a few years after the introduction of television and later technology i began to notice that childrens language began to deteriorate as did their fine and gross motor development
8894056 they no longer found building bricks exciting nor did they play imaginative games i noticed childrens attention spans began to reduce and it was becoming more and more difficult to sustain their level of interest
8894057 they need to have quiet time to play think be quiet and not be constantly stimulated every moment of the day parents should build free time into childrens busy lives especially time to play outside
8894058 play is vital to the holistic development of children it enables them to find out about themselves and the world it allows children to discover experiment create express ideas use their imagination role play invent learn new skills etc
8894059 but the question of whether to return to work or stay home has no easy or correct answer each mother must make the decision according to her circumstances children can do well either way given appropriate support
8894060 the absence of mothers in the home leaves a gap that is quickly filled by products of technology with no one around to chat or listen to them they are forced to gaze mindlessly at the tv
8894061 with home cooked meals and family dinners irregular the food industry fills our children with processed snacks
8894062 the results in terms of disaffected disengaged and self destructive young people are all around us
8894063 there is less and less free time for children to simply play
8894064 i think we are reaching a turning point that is universal we all want our children to be children again
8894065 as parents we need to encourage our children to exercise from a young age and we need to become active ourselves to make it happen
8894066 just as adults need time out to reflect and to find themselves so do our children children need quiet time to play on their own time to play in an unstructured way so as to problem solve and to reflect

8894087 top us and pakistani army commanders had a highly unusual secret meeting on board an american aircraft carrier in the indian ocean to discuss how to combat the escalating violence along the border between afghanistan and pakistan the leading actors in the day long conference were admiral mike mullen chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and pakistan army chief general ashfaq pervez kayani the meeting had been convened on tuesday august 26 by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff while officials of the two allies offered few details on wednesday about what was decided or even discussed at the meeting including any new strategies tactics weapons or troop deployment the star studded list of participants and an extreme secrecy surrounding the talks underscored how gravely the two nations regarded the growing militant threat

8894099 when you have monetary tightening you do get lower growth that was expected
8894100 but its not terribly low 7 9 percent is still high by historical standards
8894101 our economy must grow at the rate of at least ten per cent every year to get rid of poverty and generate employment for all
8894102 until we can achieve those reforms 10 percent remains an unattainable target
8894103 a profound lack of empathy and an aggrandizement of the self all leading to a polarized reality for the leader
8894104 jealous eye of the kremlin can distinguish in the end only vassals and enemies and the neighbors of russia if they do not wish to be one must reconcile themselves to being the other

8894108 mr obama is nowhere man when it comes time to speak out on reforming big city public schools with their criminally high dropout rates for minority children
8894109 he apparently refuses to do it for fear that supporting vouchers or doing anything to strengthen charter schools will alienate vote rich unions his rare references to the critical argument over affirmative action an issue on several state ballots this fall give both opponents and supporters reason to think he might be on their side he has had little if anything to say about the persistent 25 percent poverty rate in black america
8894110 after securing the nomination in june sen barack obamas first priority had to be healing the rift between himself and hillary clinton
8894111 45 years ago today brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington
8894112 he couldnt mention martin he couldnt mention the civil rights movement he couldnt mention those who sacrificed and gave so much
8894113 its very very difficult to actually create a new world if you dont acknowledge the world from which you are emerging
8894114 thats the promise of america the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
8894115 but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education keep our water clean and our toys safe invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology
8894116 our government should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work
8894117 tonight i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8894118 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own out of work tough luck no health care the market will fix it born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own
8894119 concern about the plight of the palestinian people under foreign occupations
8894120 why is a non african situation mentioned in a declaration about africa one that references neither sudans racist killings nor any other country in africa
8894121 portraying israels conflict as racial is more than political mischief
8894122 its an attempt to dehumanize israelis and their supporters as uniquely evil
8894123 the obvious result of mentioning only the palestinians as victims of racism is to demonize the jewish state
8894124 the abuja declaration indicates that continued participation by democratic nations in the durban ii process sends precisely the wrong signals to rights abusing states and their victims
8894125 unless the meeting in geneva is a joke it has to place darfur at the top of its agenda
8894126 there is no other more pressing race issue in africa than darfur
8894127 this problem has historical dimensions where black africans have borne the brunt of arab expansionism and slavery
8894128 failed to address this historical problem and sadly the successor african union has followed suit
8894129 how can africans expect outsiders to tackle the issue of darfur if they themselves are too cowardly to address it
8894130 sudan immediately interrupted with an objection supported by algeria and morocco and chairman martin uhomoibhi of nigeria ruled that country situations could not be mentioned

8894132 race in the context of the struggle for resources and power is the defining issue in the genocide
8894133 the more than 300 000 killed and three million darfurians who have been displaced are black
8894134 there is no other rational explanation for the pogroms against them except their race
8894135 calls upon states to avoid inflexibly clinging to free speech in defiance of the sensitivities existing in a society and with absolute disregard for religious feelings
8894136 goes far beyond the recognized norms for balancing prohibitions of racial hatred with respect for free speech which is the lifeblood of democracy
8894137 if the right to express ones beliefs is to be restricted by the feelings and sensitivities of others this will mark the end of free speech as we know it
8894138 draws attention to the impact of counter terrorism measures on the rise of racism including the practice of racial ethnic national and religious profiling
8894139 the united nations which still cannot manage to define terrorism has instead focused on placing roadblocks in the way of counter terrorism measures

8894344 n s vamos partir para a chacota para a ironia para a risada j chorei muito com este time mas o atual n o merece nenhuma l grima da minha parte no ano do centen rio todos quer amos gritar campe o mas como este time n o tem compet ncia vamos ironizar e gritar campe o nas derrotas afinal somos campe es de goleadas j foram seis neste ano

8894348 sou a favor de protestos inteligentes de manifesta es diferentes que fujam do rotineiro

8894367 sports keeps people from worrying about things that matter to their lives that they might have some idea of doing something about
8894368 how the very passion we invest in sports can transform it from a kind of mindless escape into a site of resistance sports can become an arena where the ideas of our society are not just presented but also challenged just as sports can reflect the dominant ideas of our society

8894426 hey i already paid for this all day ticket might as well take a look at north vancouver and ride the seabus
8894427 so i did the ride was beautiful too windows all over for everyone to enjoy what vancouver looks like both north and downtown but most of the travelers were commuters so there was a lot of ipods and reading going on
8894428 were very well poised to move into zimbabwe when it opens up in fact we have a large fleet of vehicles there and we will boost that investment immediately when it opens up
8894429 if you read between the lines the numbers for the motor dealership the distributorship and the car rental i think the margins there are declining
8894430 if the company judges this to be an outstanding claim i think that is correct well launch a process to get the money in
8894431 theyve made so many additional orders that its caused things to take a long time
8894432 hes articulate he can be aggressive when needed to be and of course hes from a part of the country where republicans typically have a hard time winning the states
8894433 theres no doubt the popularity charlie crist has would be a great asset to john mccain
8894434 we cant tell god what to do if god wants to send a storm weve got to get out of the way
8894435 you can have 1 million but if you die youre broke
8894436 heres how you can quickly amp easily start your own paid membership site and watch your income take off in just weeks
8894437 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8894438 america our work will not be easy the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past
8894439 you think about everything from campaign finance to immigration and on and theres john mccain working across party lines senator obama doesnt have a record now he can make the claim and he can hold himself up as pure and trying to reach to a new generation of post partisan politics but he has to do so largely based on rhetoric and wishful thinking because he doesnt have the record
8894440 there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically
8894441 obama might have a similar bottom line core principles for which in some sense he is willing to die if so we dont know what they are nothing so far in his life approaches mccains decision to refuse repatriation as a pow so as to deny his jailors a propaganda coup in fact there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically thats why his reversal on campaign financing and his transparently false justification of it matter more than similar acts by mccain
8894442 hes pretty much a conventional liberal on the issues and has few examples of breaking with his own party so how does obama try to pull off being post partisan
8894443 his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8894444 boren the lone democrat in oklahomas congressional delegate said that while obama has talked about working with republicans unfortunately his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8894445 the record shows obama to be a fairly doctrinaire liberal democrat
8894446 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8894447 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8894448 for a couple of days theyve been saying you voted to raise taxes something like 94 times that seems to be the drumbeat thats going to happen during this campaign are you going to raise taxes in a big way for average americans
8894449 i mean this is the standard fare of politics and the truth of the matter is that the only bills that i voted for for the most part since ive been in the senate were introduced by republicans with george bush you know they were the majority for a big chunk of the time i was there
8894450 finally the obama people are too convinced that they can define mccain as bush iii the case is just factually inaccurate mccain will be able to pull out dozens of instances from torture to global warming to spending in which he broke with his party as rush limbaugh will tell you
8894451 as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq
8894452 in early november 2003 at a time when fred dalton thompson was playing a tough d a on law and order john mccain was cross examining donald rumsfeld for real on capitol hill it was still very early into the u s occupation of iraq but the as yet unacknowledged by rummy that is insurgency was already out of control alone among his fellow gop senators mccain blasted rumsfeld for not putting enough u s troops on the ground and for resorting too soon to iraqification that is transferring security to ill prepared iraqi forces in an extraordinarily blunt speech at the council on foreign relations that grim autumn mccain warned that ultimately iraq could become another vietnam if we lose popular support in the united states the next day the secretary of defense asked mccain to breakfast i read y our speech harrumphed rumsfeld that must have been an enjoyable experience for him mccain later joked to me then rummy patiently explained to his fellow republican why he and his top civilian brass paul wolfowitz doug feith and the usual crowd of incompetents would continue to do things the same way they believed there was no need for additional troops mccain later related mccain had already realized that rumsfeld was a lost cause the real question the senator suggested to me back then was whether george w bush himself would push rummy to make changes id like to see the president fully engaged mccain said bush needed to be on top of more details of whats going on as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq right down to the need for bush to get engaged and fire rumsfeld mccain was so right that among military experts today the emerging conventional wisdom about bushs current surg e is that if it had occurred back then when mccain wanted it and the political will existed in this country to support it for the necessary number of years it might well have succeeded
8894453 widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush
8894454 on global warming mccain is widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush immediately after the 2004 election in which he stumped for bushs re election he sharply distanced himself from bush on climate change calling the administrations stance terribly disappointing mccain had co sponsored a bill with sen joe lieberman to curb greenhouse gases in 2003 bush had opposed any such move citing possible harm to the economy and doubts over global warming
8894455 he said that our economy has made great progress under this president he said that the fundamentals of the e conomy are strong
8894456 the second and third quotes the obama campaign uses from mccain are more misleading the ad shows mccain saying t heres been great progress economically the quote comes from an interview mccain did with peter cook at bloomberg television in april mccain was making a case for what he believed were positive economic developments during bushs time in office however the fuller quote shows mccain was saying that whatever progress had been made it wouldnt be enough to comfort families facing these tremendous economic challenges his comments overall are pessimistic he cites challenging times and enormous difficulties the obama campaign distorts his views by using just a snippet of his remarks
8894457 im going to ask you a version of the ronald reagan question you think if americans were asked are you better off today than you were before george bush took office more than seven years ago what answer would they give
8894458 certainly in this time we are in very challenging times
8894459 i think if you look at the overall record and millions of jobs have been created et cetera et cetera yo u could make an argument that theres been great progress economically over that period of time but thats no comfort thats no comfort to families now that are facing these tremendous economic challenges but let me just add peter the fundamentals of americas economy are strong were the greatest exporter the greatest importer the greatest innovator the greatest producer still the greatest economic engine in the world and by the way exports and free trade are a key element in economic recovery but these are tough times tough times and nobody knows that more than american families including in small towns of pennsylvania they havent lost their fundamental religious beliefs their respect for the constitution their right to bear arms they are still keep america as a beacon of hope and freedom throughout the world
8894460 he knows how to twist with the best of them
8894461 although obama gets substantial mileage out of running against politics as usual he provided a reminder on friday that he knows how to twist with the best of them
8894462 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
8894463 i do not make a promise that we can reduce the budget deficit by 2013
8894464 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families obama told reporters this week when asked if hed match mccains pledge
8894465 since winning the nomination obama reportedly has been moving toward the middle of the political spectrum but on the budget he still sounds left of center with no interest in eliminating deficit spending
8894466 frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years
8894467 barack obama says john mccains plan to balance the budget doesnt add up easy for him to say its not a goal hes even trying to reach not only does obama say he wont eliminate the deficit in his first term as mccain aims to do he frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years considering his own spending plans
8894468 obama has rhetorically committed to a pay as you go approach by offsetting new spending and tax cuts with new taxes or spending cuts but his proposals do not come close to meeting this standard
8894469 has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of
8894470 the obama campaign responds that tax cuts once enacted are usually renewed and do not expire therefore they say obama can legitimately claim to be recouping money for other purposes by scaling back the tax cuts obama has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of what he wants to do
8894471 both obama and clinton promised to not raise taxes on those making less than 200 000 or 250 000 a year they both just emasculated their domestic programs returning the rich to their clinton era tax rates will yield at best 40 billion a year in revenue its impossible to fund a health care plan let alone anything else with that kind of money the consequences are clear if elected they will have to break their pledge and thus destroy their credibility or run a minimalist administration
8894472 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8894473 the latest additions to sen barack obamas energy plan outlined during an appearance in lansing monday may win the democratic presidential candidate some votes from disgruntled consumers in november but theyll do nothing to answer the nations long term needs
8894474 when his presumptive republican opponent sen john mccain r ariz proposed a gas tax holiday as a way to reduce the high cost of driving mr obama showed political courage and intellectual honesty by refusing to sign on to that obvious gimmick its an idea to get them through an election mr obama said now he has two such gimmicks of his own
8894475 the politics may have changed but the facts havent the accuracy of sen mccains original position has not changed offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today it would not lower gas prices next year and it would not lower gas prices five years from now
8894476 i think john mccains proposal for a three month tax holiday is a bad idea
8894477 in this campaign john mccain is offering the same old gimmicks that will provide almost no short term relief to folks who are struggling with high gas prices gimmicks that will only increase our addiction for another four years
8894478 that might make sense in washington but it doesnt make sense for america in fact it makes about as much sense as his proposal to build 45 new nuclear reactors without a plan to store the waste some place other than guess where right here in nevada at yucca mountain
8894479 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
8894480 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
8894481 but to add a five year tax increase on top of that to pay for a one year gift to voters would indeed increase the cost of doing business that cost would be passed along in forgone investment in new production lower dividends for pension funds and other shareholders and higher prices at the pump thus socking it to the consumers whom the plan is supposed to help if oil prices fall there might be no windfall profits to tax then the obama rebate would have to be paid for through spending cuts taxes on something else or borrowing
8894482 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families
8894483 what obama voted for was a budget resolution that would have allowed most of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire in particular the resolution would allow the 25 percent tax bracket to return to its pre 2001 level of 28 percent that bracket kicks in at 32 550 for an individual or 65 100 for a married couple but as those of you who have filled out a 1040 know thats not actually how income taxes work we dont pay taxes on our total earnings we pay them based on our taxable income the urban brookings tax policy centers eric toder told factcheck org that people with taxable income of 32 000 would have a total income greater than that in 2008 anyone filing taxes with single status would be entitled to a standar d deduction of 5 450 as well as a personal exemption of 3 500 so to have a taxable income high enough to reach the 25 percent bracket an individual would need to earn at least 41 500 in total income while a married couple would need a combined income of at least 83 000
8894484 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes
8894485 campaign aides to senator obama today called the charge that he voted for tax hikes on people making only 32 000 a year quote bogus they circulated an analysis stating that the resolution that obama had voted for would not have increase taxes on single taxpayer making less than 41 500 a year in total income
8894486 vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year
8894487 factcheck org a nonpartisan web site said the vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year the 32 000 figure it said was the amount of taxable income those people had
8894488 some of these are bookmarks but some are things they just slipped in here so they wouldnt lose it

8894503 well just get in the studio have a few wines eat some cake and go for it
8894504 im a personal friend of james blunts guitarist and he put the message in
8894505 it could be pretty soon ive got some time off coming up so im gonna pursue it im definitely gonna try and get something in the bag
8894506 you dont really direct the fringe you just cling on to it and hope to be there at the end
8894507 i dont think we can afford to wait for a new director to be in place i would ideally like to see decisions being made about the box office before christmas and i would be surprised if we had a new director in place by then
8894508 everyone is agreed that this is one of the top priorities for the fringe we have to run a central box office and we have to get it right
8894509 the fringe office has been very self serving in recent years and i do not think it has engaged with the venues in the way it needs to
8894510 there are serious issues that need to be addressed chiefly financial the cost to the performer is going up the cost to the public is going up and yet these costs are not been met with increased revenue
8894511 from my perspective the main problem was the lack of communication the fringe is all about collaboration and open discussion but jon chose to be a more distant figure than his predecessors not returning calls and refusing to engage
8894512 the new director will have to be a real leader in order to take it forward
8894513 the cost of putting a show into the programme is one area they could look at bringing down
8894514 the council needs to start putting proper funding into the fringe in order to make this happen it brings in 75 million a year to the local economy and investing in it would make sound business sense as it could enable it to grow and bring in 80m or 90m a year
8894515 the role of director is not a creative role and they do not need a creative person they need to be a brilliant administrator and someone who can engage with the local council
8894516 like most of the festival it could no doubt make a case for more funding
8894517 all of the cities festivals have an international reputation that is the envy of the world and we want to help them go from strength to strength if that means we need review our funding then there is nothing to stop us doing that
8894518 there have been a lot of issues for the fringe to deal with this year not just the box office there has also been the impact of the weather and the olympic games and all of that needs to be taken into account
8894519 given all that i dont think it has been too bad a year for the fringe and i dont think it needs to change too much the fringe itself needs to beware of becoming too bureaucratic what makes it so special is that anarchic quality which means you are never sure what you are going to get

8894530 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
8894531 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
8894532 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
8894533 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
8894534 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
8894535 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
8894536 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
8894537 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past

8894565 i found this affection difficult to reciprocate you can imagine there i would be strolling hand in hand with my apparently fond male parent along a cliff edge or a river bank or a parapet and the thought would occur to me that he might suddenly decide to shove me or bash me to death with a rock preserving a calm fa ade under these circumstances was a challenge after such excursions i would retire to my room and dissolve in flood of tears
8894566 i think its normal that a player says that he wants to leave and in the case of robinho i accept that as being totally normal it seems to me that its a mistake but its his problem
8894567 i think that his representatives are advising him very badly and i have a lot of faith in the lad i believe he has a lot of quality and could be successful here but i say it again that i have to defend the interests of this club in the best manner possible
8894568 the truth is i dont know the player continues having a contract with his club and as such we cannot do anything
8894569 i cant say anything about the coming year either because i dont know what is going to happen we dont even know if we are going to be here we hope that he comes touch wood but in a years time many things can happen
8894570 all the fans want to see a player like cristiano ronaldo here but i am convinced that in the same manner that manchester would love to see all our players in their team
8894571 cristiano is not going to come now as for the coming year only god knows
8894572 it did not seem that kakas position needed to be covered according to the coaching team
8894573 we had reached an agreement with the milan but bayern went directly through the player behind milans back and offered him considerably more money
8894574 it was a blow when the plane we sent to pick him up returned empty i am disappointed
8894575 it was an offer we could not have refused it is comparable to the transfer of karel poborsky to manchester united
8894576 although several big clubs were interested in signing tomas we agreed with tomas for cska as their interest was supported by a concrete offer and the result of the negotiation was a very attractive contract for the footballer
8894577 he is a young player who we have signed with a view to the future he is two footed fast and strong in the air
8894578 i am looking forward to being allowed to play in germany here the level is very high
8894579 friends at manchester city told me he has been working very well

8894583 slepicka is a type of the forward that is suitable for the national team
8894584 i am sorry he cant play i picked him but i understand him and respect his decision
8894585 i have spoken with him several times recently i met him in prague when he was there for the birth of his second daughter
8894586 we agreed that he would appear in the national team again but during this week he changed his mind
8894587 he said the birth of his second child played a role it is his final decision and we have to accept the fact he would not play any more

8894592 i have got to tell you that i am slowly getting really annoyed with this
8894593 we have always said that lukas will be staying with fc bayern you all keep calling cologne to try and get any story you can even if it is only that podolskis grandma went into the club shop and bought herself a scarf
8894594 i think we have to learn and that particularly means the media to work a bit more intelligently
8894595 then you will have to find yourselves another story for the next few months
8894596 i think this whole debate is a bit below the belt
8894597 of course miro is not as successful now as we and he would like but to question somebody immediately is completely over the top

8894600 russia acted in accordance with one of the basic principles of international law the right for self determination and we are not all eager to teach upon the subject by those who just several months ago not only recognized the independence of kosvo but also tried to make others the same
8894601 we are not ready to begin the cold war because the previous cold war lasted for more than 40 years it was basically on ideology basis
8894602 we do not want to start it again and we are agar to maintain as much as possible the partnership we have effectively established with usa eu for the last 17 years we wouldnt want to break away from our partners we will wait and see if our partners are radical to us or not
8894603 we do not have reason to break up the ties we has established during the last one and half decade and we are not sure that after this we will witness cold war but cold peace let us see how long this will take
8894604 of course we have some differences in mind history etc but in that effect we have common economic ties between russia and the rest of the world and very strong and sophisticated and nobody wants to break it
8894605 let us wait and see as for russia we wont want to act first for example it was nato decision freezes samples collaboration and if they want our cooperation we will continue but if they want to draw a line ok
8894606 we are ready to cooperate with these countries we are ready to withdraw from some position but we will want to maintain possibilities of our partnership with the uk us eu nato etc
8894607 it was after the bloody hostilities initiated by georgia that russia deployed its peacekeeping forces in both conflict regions out mission was internationally recognized and legalized in agreement signed also by georgia itself
8894608 actually rebuilding of the former soviet union is by no means and reasons the aim of the nowadays russian policy
8894609 for more than 17 years we have tried repeatedly to solve both conflicts by the peaceful means preserving georgias territory integrity and simply trying to prevent killing people in abkhazia and south ossetia
8894610 but three weeks ago saakashvili regime launched such an insolent and bloody aggression that it effectively ended hopes for a unified state in which georgians abkhazia and south ossetia could live together
8894611 so the russians decision just reflects the fact that the very possibility of solving the problem within the framework of georgians state was finally demolished by the latest massacre in tskhinvali and it is mr saakashvili and his western patron to be blamed for

8894615 as long as no serious bugs are found we plan on going gold early to mid september
8894616 the idea is to create an alternative route starting from sikkims eastern part near rongli into bhutans pangola range that separates sikkim from bhutan and on to phuentsholing before it re enters indian territory at chalsa in the dooars region an aerial survey will be conducted for the route from the first week of september soon after the route feasibility will be studied on foot which is likely to take a month
8894617 the secretary appreciated our view that the only solution to sikkims accessibility problems lies in an alternative route he suggested that we go ahead with a feasibility after which the ministry would approach the ministry of external affairs mea to further take up the issue with bhutan
8894618 a proposal for routing this access through bhutan or nepal and into bangladesh was considered at a meeting while no final decision was taken at our end it is understood that sikkim does need an alternative to nh 31a

8894643 extracting oil from algae to produce a more sustainable biofuel is one of the most promising and exciting areas of biofuels research today
8894644 algae have significant potential as a clean renewable and economical fuel source and they do not compete with the food supply
8894645 for enterprise our companys success depends on the availability of vehicles and fuel and both must be acceptable to society that is why we are taking steps now to invest in the future
8894646 it explores the tentative and often awkward humorous first steps in the lives of two people stumbling into a new relationship together
8894647 we felt the time had come for consumers to get the jump at the pump
8894648 our team has been in the oil business for decades we know how the industry sets prices
8894649 for years we have provided a service to gasoline distributors and station operators that predicts wholesale price changes with amazing accuracy and we knew that if we could predict wholesale prices we could extend our model to predict retail
8894650 shopping around to save 2 cents after the price has already moved up 10 cents is a real shame it doesnt have to be that way
8894651 our countrys 56th presidential election is significant in many ways during the primary election young voters turned out in unprecedented numbers and the controversy and excitement surrounding the candidates have been extraordinary
8894652 with our collection of history resources school library media specialists and teachers can transform schools into campaign central with the articles activities and classroom ideas on our election site students will discover the history of u s elections and develop an understanding of how the past has shaped the way campaign 2008 works
8894653 you cant have a recall of students and say wait we did it wrong come back

8894655 i am excited to be part of this years conference im sure there will be great discussion about the best practices in the industry
8894656 i look forward to sharing how msnbc com successfully implemented the halogen performance management tool
8894657 as a speaker i am impressed with how well halogen has developed content that addresses the needs of its customers
8894658 my session addresses how weve leveraged employee performance management as a critical part of our business alignment model linking individual objectives to organizational goals for improved corporate performance
8894659 we expect the 2008 user conference will shine as our best conference yet the content is designed based on the feedback and insight we have received from our customers
8894660 were constantly working to exceed the expectations of our diverse group of more than 1000 customers and provide them with maximum value
8894661 its more powerful when the consumer is telling you what they want
8894662 its saying the brain trust for good ideas isnt being held by a few people
8894663 i call this a neo contemporary art movement the combination of commercial and fine art like warhol did in the 80s
8894664 our vision of artsprojekt is to liberate every artist in the world by allowing them to productize their ideas and monetize their obsessions
8894665 you have a lot of people who can do low end design you know they can create a logo they can lay out a web page even though theyre not professionals
8894666 theyre adequate enough that they can make a supplementary income doing it or do it for fun
8894667 the age of community has arrived to the degree that companies are able to foster a vibrant community of designers as a way of creating new types of products
8894668 i spoke to someone close to him a few weeks back and they told me the reason he wanted to leave was because the old manager john lyall had been sacked
8894669 incey grew up without a dad and john was like a father to him when he got the push paul couldnt stay
8894670 yes he made a mistake being pictured in a manchester united shirt but i reckon a lot of the fans at the game will be too young to remember it anyway
8894671 ive met s amus on a number of occasions since the championship defeat
8894672 and we expect to know his intentions on monday so we can make them known at the committee meeting
8894673 s amus has the full backing of the board if he is willing to continue on there is no question about that
8894674 garageband gave me an environment to get in work not mess around too much with the tech stuff and then get out i started posting a lot of stuff on macjams com then i found out a couple people had already done shows on second life
8894675 if you plug a live stream into that you have a live show
8894676 and when you have an avatar there it becomes an interactive thing avatars can dance and you can see comments people type
8894677 my main thing is trying to promote my music the secondary thing has been the money
8894678 because i have a full time job i dont play a lot of shows but its a lot more than i could play in real life
8894679 the great thing is its allowed me to gig at all the other thing is theres a pretty good chance that ill be performing for people all over the country and parts of europe asia and australia
8894680 at this point i do a lot of shows for free
8894681 its kind of frightening writing songs about technology because things are changing so fast
8894682 id say i write two or three regular songs for every second life song and theres been a few that are somewhere in between like closing time at the roadhouse that song is named after a place in second life that i liked to hang out and the atmosphere of that place reminded me of this scene of the last couple in a bar having one last dance before they have to go back to their regular lives but most of my second life stuff goes for the funny as much as i can
8894683 i would like to sell cds at a brisker pace but ive never been invested in making a career in second life music there are people that play two or three shows a day and thats enough to kind of eek by i think of it mostly as a place i can do shows and sell stuff while at the same time interact with people
8894684 keiko takamura she was on mtv so shes gotten a lot of press about that
8894685 the nice thing is i can come into this room plug in my guitar and do a show and when im done i can wander to the fridge and get a beer or go upstairs and go to bed
8894686 another advantage to playing online is i can cheat and look at my lyrics
8894687 we are a husband and wife team who has worked in online education for many years
8894688 because of our background we knew there was a need for a comprehensive easy to use index of online associate degree programs
8894689 deciding to take the plunge and go back to school even an online school can be intimidating if you dont know what to expect
8894690 the intent of our website is to provide information so that potential students can sign up for online classes feeling confident and prepared
8894691 too often websites that claim to offer this information are difficult to use and contain outdated information and links
8894692 since we believe in the value of an online education we decided to start our own website one that was easy to navigate and updated regularly

8894699 we have lost another champion another hero greg fought to the end and delivered a clear message to congress
8894700 the members of congress cannot understand what these men and women are experiencing not only are those who served at ground zero suffering sick and dying but families are devastated putting childrens futures at risk these heroes must have an america which takes care of instead of forgets its heroes the james zadroga 9 11 health amp compensation bill must be passed when congress returns from recess so that this national disgrace can finally come to an end
8894701 we are going to put the honest truth about ground zeros suffering heroes in their faces and hope that decency will prevail and they finally pass this legislation before another september 11th passes all of us are wondering about cancers and other diseases that are showing up five six seven years later what will our families face in the future
8894702 ahora vamos a tratar de completar los objetivos que estaban centrados para el a o si bien en lo salarial no era lo que pretend amos que era que un cargo iguale a la canasta familiar el torno a eso el reclamo no va a estar completo si no se llega a eso nosotros vamos a hacer cumplir lo que se ha acordado en el marco de paritarias que es garantizar el cien por cien de zona sobre el piso salarial que se fije a nivel salarial como as tambi n avanzar en el convenio colectivo
8894703 esto va a ser un tema que afecta en lo laboral y en lo edilicio lo cual ser a algo impracticable para este gobierno por lo que es central que gobierno comience a discutir en forma inmediata esto y cumpla con lo que ha prometido
8894704 los dos grandes objetivos saldada la cuesti n presupuestaria salarial para lo que resta del a o va a centrarse en la discusi n de la ley federal de educaci n y dentro de ese contexto las titularizaciones para todos los niveles en curso sobretodo el nivel medio que es el m s postergado en ese punto
8894705 los docentes que presentan problemas para acceder a las titularizaci n son los que tienen materiales muy especiales que s lo existen en escuelas de arte y que son cargos nuevos pero que a su vez son docentes muy antiguos que dan materias que cambiaron de denominaci n
8894706 saldado ese tema se est dando cumplimiento a la ley 630 que es la de titularizaci n del a o 2004 y pasar amos a pedir un proceso de titularizaci n mixto que contemple a aquellos cargos que no titularizaron y los cargos que se generaron posterior a la ley sean por antecedentes y oposici n por antecedentes los anteriores al a o 2004 y por antecedentes y oposici n para los cargos jer rquicos esto es una idea que se tiene la cual debe ser discutida y tratada con las bases

8894725 the wii is a well made device that has found a new target group for a while we held the same target group with the singstar karaoke game perhaps we neglected to pursue that avenue
8894726 playstation games are rather designed for those who play a lot although its a different strategy it pays off we currently have a production bottleneck with the playstation 3
8894727 the major difference lies in the fact that nintendo makes money with the hardware alone which may be a superior business model but the wii is not succeeding at our expense it is not hurting us we decided years ago to build a game console that offers much greater functionality
8894728 the traditional business model for the playstation envisaged us making a loss with the hardware in the early years until the production costs had decreased to a point that enabled us to break even in the meantime we earn money with the games we are currently at the stage in which we need to get a grip on the production costs that takes time we are already making more money with the games than we are losing with the hardware
8894729 he said i hate to break it to you peter but having a number of people working on something doesnt really guarantee success microsoft has had thousands of people working on vista and look how that turned out

8894739 le tattiche di guerriglia messe in atto dai soldati giapponesi erano sorprendenti e inattese un cecchino non sparava per uccidere un soldato ma per ferirlo e uccidere il medico che cercava di curarlo in tal modo si assicurava che nessun altro nemico potesse essere curato i cadaveri dei nemici poi venivano lasciati a terra imbottiti di esplosivo in modo da eliminare chi pensasse di raccoglierne i resti per riportarli nelle retrovie
8894740 i soldati giapponesi non avevano paura di morire per difendere la loro patria di fronte al nemico e a nessun altra opzione valida non fuggivano ma caricavano in attacchi kamikaze quantunque disperati con lo scopo di portare con s qualche nemico
8894741 so whether you eat or drink or whatever you do do it all for the glory of god

8894749 weve tried to maintain an air of calm and sanity around the process this has not been as dramatic for us as choosing a vice president
8894750 but in the end its a very small victory compared to the victories i hope and plan to have throughout the year

8894753 the quarterbacks have to build their credentials with the players and thats done really long before practice starts during the offseason program
8894754 they build credibility with their work effort and their commitment and how they interact with their teammates so the players can root for all three of them and as a coach you can root for any one of the three to win the job

8894760 andy burnham the culture secretary is a man to watch sports mad andy has had a good olympics he too speaks with genuine delight about the success of our athletes and has shown at these games that he has the down to earth warmth and sound common sense that make him a potential labour leader at some point in the future
8894761 having spent the last 24 hours in his company accompanying him to ukraine on arguably the most important trip he has made since becoming foreign secretary there is no doubt that he has grown into the job and is thoroughly enjoying himself the highly energetic mr miliband takes it all in his stride and displays an almost effortless mastery of his brief there is no doubt that mr miliband is a very bright man but now he seems to have found some policies to give his office some real depth and meaning the world has been crying out for someone to make a ground breaking speech on the georgian crisis and his performance in kiev where he set out the challenges of the post cold war era will i believe come to be seen as the defining moment of his tenure at the foreign office
8894762 he comes across as a boy cold warrior without weapons playing with fire in a part of the world he understands but dimly maybe he is still planning his first cabinet and too distracted by the slow collapse of the government he represents to do the homework he needs to do to understand the world of the caucasus he has chosen the weakest and worst of all the possible responses to the ill judged georgian adventure and the unacceptable russian invasion he has decided to talk tough and act weakly

8894822 i absolutely and totally support brendan nelson the former treasurer told reporters
8894823 he has been elected as the leader of the liberal party to take the liberal party to the next election and to win the next election and he will have my total and utter support in doing that
8894824 as far as im concerned the liberal party leadership is a team of dr nelson and julie bishop and im supporting them
8894825 i intend to keep on serving the people of higgins he said
8894826 peters made his decision that he did not seek the leadership of the party he told reporters
8894827 as ive said before id be very happy if he changes his mind thats his business
8894828 what dr nelson was referring to is that he would be very happy for mr costello to stay on in parliament the spokesman said
8894829 costello is undeniably the liberal partys best political asset now that howard has gone which is why so much turns on whether he recovers the will to serve which so clearly and understandably wavered in the aftermath of the election mr abbott wrote in

8894868 i dont want to get him fired up too much
8894869 they gave me no 45 archies number and called me little archie my dad just always told me to be me im not archie im tyler were different people with the same last name
8894870 its just a little jam i got in the scrimmage its nothing
8894871 it will just be sore for a couple of days
8894872 id have little nagging things here and there but i could always push through it and play
8894873 but this was one thing i could just not perform even 50 percent
8894874 it felt like i was stepping on nails every time i put some weight on it
8894875 it wasnt like you could tape it up and just take some ibuprofen or some painkillers
8894876 it was constantly there i just had to let it rest
8894877 i came into the season with high hopes when i knew i wasnt going to play the rest of the year it was kind of depressing but then again that sort of thing happens for a reason i kind of looked at it as a chance to learn i took it as a way to get better
8894878 if you look back to last year ross was playing good football before he got the toe injury
8894879 ross is getting just so much more comfortable with the scheme understanding it all before he played great on just natural instincts when you combine instincts with an understanding of the defense its just going to continue to skyrocket for him
8894880 he was instinctive he didnt know the defense but he was always around the football and was real active in all of our scrimmages
8894881 i personally live about 10 miles from the plant and i felt it
8894882 our back was turned and it was like somebody shined a giant spotlight on us
8894883 i thought my house was falling down on top of me thats how hard the vibration was
8894884 people should be confident they have not been exposed to highly dangerous chemicals
8894885 there are a few things id like to change we got into a rhythm and i didnt want to come out of the game
8894886 hopefully in these next few days we can heal up
8894887 everyone knows were pretty banged up it will be nice to get some rest and get all our guys back and be 100 percent for dallas
8894888 we would have liked to have a touchdown on that first one which was a little upsetting
8894889 its not the conventional quarterback situation where if you have a 10 play period the backup guy is going to get four or three plays
8894890 this guy is going to maybe squeeze two during a period the way carson likes to take the reps
8894891 it was very important just to gain the confidence of my teammates in terms of being able to put some drives together and get the ball in the end zone a couple times
8894892 that was the main goal coming into the preseason and i think for the most part we did a pretty good job
8894893 thats an added bonus and its a great quality to have
8894894 i thought he did a great job everybody is real comfortable with ryan at quarterback

8894926 we definitely wont leave the government house until we can topple samaks administration
8894927 he cannot stay on for long i am very sure of that you can see people coming more and more to join us
8894928 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8894929 we have a duty to push back and push back now
8894930 push back what could they do to us they cant fire us its time for us to say no thank you we will not cut our budget
8894931 but were in this situation and weve asked agencies to identify areas of reduction
8894932 theres no question were going to work really hard to try to do the peoples business
8894933 but its definitely going to slow down the courts and cause a backlog in the county jails and a slowdown in civil litigation
8894934 all they hear is bad news they dont know if theyll have a job tomorrow
8894935 when you get backed into a corner you have to fight with every weapon available
8894936 i dont need to change my name and the whole giving away the bride what is the point of it
8894937 the soul mate myth is destructive because it will keep you from forming authentic relationships that have a chance to thrive instead of fail
8894938 dont marry because you think you have found your soul mate it is bound to buckle under the unbearable weight of expected perfection
8894939 it seems to me that people are looking for a clone
8894940 he supports me he believes in me marriage cant be me me me what does he get out of it
8894941 nowadays it doesnt have to be that women want to marry a doctor because she is the doctor
8894942 have fun in your 20s get a good job get married have a family that path will make some women happy but for others it wont
8894943 some people get married too quickly without really knowing each other well enough some people get married because of tax es or health insurance and other financial benefits
8894944 some people get married because they feel like its the expected thing to do or they dont want to be alone or because theyre ready to start a family
8894945 getting married is not the only life choice available for a happy life
8894946 the most important thing is that i continue to grow as a person i want to be the happiest person i can possibly be
8894947 if that means i end up staying single for the rest of my life because i havent found the right mate thats perfectly all right with me im fine with taking on the role of the hip spinster aunt to my siblings kids
8894948 we recognise that many people who want to go out for a pint or a glass of wine do at times want a value choice we have made this available in more than 200 of our pubs and are looking to increase that further

8894959 we have comprehensive health and safety processes in place in all of our pubs which include independent audits of our kitchens to ensure that the highest standards are delivered
8894960 based on the limited information disclosed to us prior to the programme being aired we conducted a thorough internal investigation of the health and safety procedures in these pubs and have made a number of improvements both in terms of training and processes
8894961 subsequent independent audits have shown that high standards have been achieved and maintained since this issue was brought to our attention

8895007 for 18 long months you have stood up one by one and said enough to the politics of the past you understand that in this election the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result you have shown what history teaches us that at defining moments like this one the change we need doesnt come from washington change comes to washington change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time

8895109 if i were to suggest that between the earth and mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided i were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes but if i were to go on to say that since my assertion cannot be disproved it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it i should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense if however the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books taught as the sacred truth every sunday and instilled into the minds of children at school hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the inquisitor in an earlier time
8895110 i am thinking about buying an iphone but i have been hearing reports about its unreliability should i be worried should i wait for the problems to be fixed before i purchase an iphone should i not get an iphone at all
8895111 i like the iphone for its touch screen interface and for the fact that i can combine my ipod and my mobile phone into one device i even like that i can use an app like maps occasionally but thats it mainly i want a mobile phone that i can depend on for making and receiving calls without having to jump through hoops or read hundreds of pages of documentation

8895141 it is impossible for a christian to have a secular job if you follow jesus and you are doing what you do in his name then it is no longer secular work its sacred you are there god is there the difference is our awareness
8895142 so i stood up one sunday and said if you are here and you arent a christian we are thrilled to have you in our midst we want you to feel right at home but if you are here and youre a christian and you cant even be a chrsitian in the parking lot please dont go out into the world and tell people youre a christian youll screw it up for the rest of us and by the way we could use your seat people cheered
8895143 the goal here isnt simply to not sin our purpose is to increase the shalom in this world which is why approaches to the christain faith that deal solely with not sinning always fail they aim at the wrong thing
8895144 usually we pastors can go on and thats the problem we put on the mask suck it up and keep going but we have to let the game stop
8895145 your job is the relentless pursuit of who god has made you to be and anything else you do is sin and you need to repent of it i started identifying how much of my life was about making sure the right people were pleased with me and as this became more and more clear i realised how less and less pleased i was with myself our lives become so heavily oriented around the expectations of others that we become more and more like them and less and less like ourselves we become split
8895146 sabbath is a day when at the end i say i didnt do anything today and i dont add and i feel so guity
8895147 i am like you i have seen plenty done in the name of god that im sure god doesnt want anything to do with i have lots of reasons for bailing on the whole thing
8895148 we were advised of operational reasons as to why it wasnt released at the time but certainly it would have been better if it was to be released that it was released a long time ago
8895149 i still think its highly unlikely given the quality of the video and the fleeting glance and the other work that was done i think its highly unlikely that youll get an identification from that footage
8895150 the vision was considered by successive independent reviews conducted into the macro investigation including the international panel of experts headed by detective superintendent paul schramm and none recommended the vision be released
8895151 when we did our review it was some eight years after the event the disappearance and murder of jane so as a consequence of that we made no recommendation either one way or another regarding the release of the footage
8895152 clearly its common sense to say that the closer you release this sort of footage to the event then the more advantageous it is so yes if it was going to be released its best it be released earlier
8895153 certainly with the passing of time the likelihood of an identification had diminished
8895154 i think that in every investigation thats under constant review you do reach a time when you have to reassess those decisions and in hindsight it may have been better to have made a decision to release that footage earlier than now
8895155 part of the investigation was to either rule this mystery person in or out
8895156 whether that person had anything to do with the investigation certainly the review team thought unlikely but with hindsight certainly it may have been better to release it in closer proximity to the event

8895177 tell me what is more american than pumpkin at thanksgiving
8895178 at this time of year there are really only two major styles competing for seasonal popularity and between the oktoberfest beers and the pumpkin flavored brands i think pumpkin beer wins hands down for uniqueness and flavor
8895179 brewers can practice a ton of creativity when it comes to the pumpkin beer style some pumpkin ales purely rely on natural pumpkin flavors while others are highly spiced and take on the pure delight of liquid pumpkin pie
8895180 the amount of exuberance that pumpkin beer gets its just unbelievable
8895181 its not just a fad people honestly cant wait for pumpkin beer
8895182 the choices we make in life bring upon a lot of sadness and a lot of hurt and a lot of pain

8895268 sedici anni fa mi avete dato lonore di guidare il nostro partito alla vittoria e guidare la nazione in una nuova era di pace e prosperit insieme abbiamo battuto i repubblicani in una campagna dura nella quale venivo attaccato perch troppo giovane e inesperto per essere il comandante supremo delle forze armate vi ricorda qualcosa nel 1992 non ha funzionato perch noi eravamo dalla parte giusta della storia e non funzioner neppure nel 2008 perch anche obama dalla parte giusta della storia
8895269 quello di sapere ispirare la gente infondere la speranza guidarla verso un orizzonte pi alto ha lintelligenza e la curiosit che non possono mancare in un presidente ha mostrato di avere una chiara comprensione della politica estera delle sfide sul fronte della sicurezza nazionale e una ferma determinazione a rimettere in sesto le nostre forze armate

8895277 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
8895278 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
8895279 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
8895280 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza

8895290 ich bin 30 bitte helfen sie mir ber die stra e
8895291 i have dressed so many people but i have to be sincere the person that made me feel so very very happy was julia roberts
8895292 when she got the academy award for erin brockovich i watched it on television and really i was so excited that she appeared in my dress it makes me so very happy and proves once more that movie stars love my clothes
8895293 reichs whose work inspired the hit tv series elizabeth peters
8895294 i am feeling really good obviously i still need to adapt to the training again because its totally different to how you train with an international team
8895295 i feel ready for aston villa but it depends on what rafa thinks
8895296 i won the gold not just for me but for all the liverpool fans my team mates who were here working hard and for rafa as well rafa and the club gave me the chance to win this gold medal they could have told me i couldnt go
8895297 i have to say thank you to everyone here at the club and also the fans for understanding i will now try to do my best to help bring some titles to liverpool
8895298 i dont know how a premier league or champions league win would compare to an olympic medal because i havent won them but i know the olympics are maybe a step down from the champions league even though it was very important for me because of the history and for my country
8895299 some of the liverpool physios and the doctor asked me if they could see the gold medal but i dont like to do that the olympic games has gone
8895300 but of course i am very happy its a great feeling for me and my country
8895301 its amazing to think i am the first argentinean to win two gold medals like this as the years pass ill tell my daughter and children about it the medals are in liverpool but as soon as i get the chance to go back to argentina i will take them with me
8895302 i could enjoy the situation for my country but its not easy when you beat some of your team mates who you spend the whole year with in the same city
8895303 maybe lucas and ryan wanted to win the gold medals as well so its a difficult moment okay i was happy to beat brazil but lucas was very sad so i obviously tried to be respectful
8895304 but this is football there are no hard feelings and now well work together to help liverpool we have forgotten about it
8895305 c mo pueden los l deres guerrilleros desatender los desastrosos resultados que ha producido la lucha armada que ha sido factor en el surgimiento de los grupos paramilitares la desaparici n del movimiento campesino el debilitamiento del movimiento sindical la contrarreforma agraria y el terror cotidiano de las ltimas d cadas
8895306 as i do quite regularly yes im just that arrogant my blog pretty much owns the space my linkedin profile shows up so does my naymz profile that i never update there are a few rogue facebook profiles but i pretty much own the phrase
8895307 the club has created superb foundations and a great structure on the one hand they have done that through investment but on the other hand through a fantastic team
8895308 they will get a lot of points this season but not on saturday it will be hard game but we are bayer leverkusen and we are at home
8895309 leverkusen will of course finish amongst the top five at the end of the season
8895310 in order to win there we need to step up our performance from the previous two games but i trust the team to rise to this task
8895311 we have had the most shots in the bundesliga so far but have only scored four goals we have to be more effective with our goalscoring opportunities
8895312 this is a new process and the food sector is learning how best to make submissions
8895313 this will come as a shock to industry and a blow to companies that have had their applications rejected the potential economic damage is vast
8895314 these opinions make it clear it is not going to be easy for companies to have claims approved
8895315 i know him from our games last year against milan and also from his national side he wasnt easy to play against hes extremely strong
8895316 he has certain qualities that we can use to our advantage i think its great that bayern have added this player
8895317 we felt the time had come for consumers to get the jump at the pump
8895318 our team has been in the oil business for decades we know how the industry sets prices
8895319 for years we have provided a service to gasoline distributors and station operators that predicts wholesale price changes with amazing accuracy and we knew that if we could predict wholesale prices we could extend our model to predict retail
8895320 shopping around to save 2 cents after the price has already moved up 10 cents is a real shame it doesnt have to be that way
8895321 it does bother me because the core of the team should be spanish but there it is looking ahead the only player there is sergio ramos he is the youngest
8895322 but continuity can be a good thing and it is just a question of fine tuning
8895323 we have to recover the dominance that we have not had in europe for six years but it is more difficult than people realise
8895324 i buy expensive suits they just look cheap on me
8895325 i just felt so so bad about that and i knew i could help
8895326 warren buffett is mainly known for his oversize square frame eyeglasses which make him look like a dynamic visionary but are admittedly a bit harsh
8895327 to soften that look ill probably work with a number of intriguing new colors i spotted on a leaf peeping trip to maine last year
8895328 so well play with these a bit for warren and see how it goes i think they will work well
8895329 whose look is unwavering blue jeans black mock turtleneck tucked in and sneakers
8895330 so i may do something for steve jobs too get him to mix it up a bit i dont know exactly what yet
8895331 i felt just awful when the bloomberg wire service published an obituary for him on wednesday and i want to do something for him to let him to know wed all really like him to stick around
8895332 if i had one wish for myself it would be to fall in love thats asking for trouble but thats the truth
8895333 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8895334 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8895335 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8895336 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8895337 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8895338 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8895339 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8895340 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8895341 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8895342 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8895343 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8895344 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8895345 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8895346 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8895347 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8895348 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8895349 who are open to doing something on the production side
8895350 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8895351 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8895352 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8895353 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8895354 brothers please come and surround our leaders to prevent the police from getting them
8895355 we can withstand any difficult conditions if we can topple samak
8895356 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8895357 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8895358 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8895359 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8895360 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8895361 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8895362 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8895363 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8895364 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8895365 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8895366 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8895367 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8895368 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8895369 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8895370 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8895371 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8895372 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8895373 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8895374 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8895375 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8895376 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8895377 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8895378 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8895379 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8895380 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8895381 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8895382 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8895383 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8895384 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8895385 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8895386 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8895387 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8895388 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8895389 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8895390 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8895391 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8895392 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8895393 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8895394 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8895395 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8895396 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8895397 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8895398 look at the sky we are not alone the whole universe is friendly to us and conspires only to give the best to those who dream and work

8895442 we sort of hoped our lawmakers would have recognized the negative effects of the ethanol mandate before they mandated it
8895443 in the 3rd quarter pacific ethanols in house production of ethanol will surpass resales volume if peix can slowly substitute its own ethanol for ethanol resold in past quarters to the same customers peix can expand its margin in other words if its margin is 1 cent on resold volume it can make 5 10 cents on in house production so even if the spread between corn and ethanol stabilizes better margins from selling peix home made rather than resales volume of ethanol can create a wider operating margin than during the plant construction phase kudos to peix for developing a marketing business ahead of the construction completion of its plants
8895444 biofuels were developed in response to a very serious problem they werent invented just for fun

8895493 underage drinking and alcohol misuse by young people is already beginning to have serious repercussions on public health and young peoples life prospects and will continue to do so for future generations unless something is done to tackle the problem
8895494 for many young people experimentation with alcohol is a natural part of the transition into adulthood unfortunately and for a complicated mix of reasons youthful curiosity can sometimes give way to more harmful drinking patterns

8895529 esistono due versioni del romanzo ma io ho letto quella che contiene un capitolo in pi solo dopo aver lavorato per molti mesi alla sceneggiatura sono rimasto sorpreso perch non cera alcun rapporto con lo stile satirico del resto del libro credo che leditore sia riuscito a convincere burgess a chiudere con una nota di speranza o qualcosa di simile sinceramente quando ho letto lultimo capitolo non potevo credere ai miei occhi alex esce di prigione e torna a casa uno dei ragazzi si sposa laltro sparisce e alla fine alex decide di diventare un adulto responsabile

8895531 based on the information provided to us by texas tech there doesnt appear to be a violation
8895532 its his turn hes a sharp kid hes technically sound i have all the faith in the world hes going to do a good job because hes a student of the game if theres one word to describe him its disciplined hes a very disciplined individual
8895533 i think hes great at watching film and i think hes great at improving himself and seeing what are the things to work on to improve
8895534 the other thing about him is he never really gets down and he never lets the defense get in his head and hold him back
8895535 i would love to play at the next level thats obviously my goal
8895536 but when you have an opportunity like this with this much talent around you with one last year of college thats not something thats on my mind
8895537 its more like winning every game we play here and then once the season is over well worry about what happens next i just think with this team and with the players we have if i start thinking about anything else im selling myself short
8895538 this has been a year of significant change with the brand now represented across the uk an in twelve countries overseas we are still in a turnaround period and our costs have continued to outpace our income as we vigorously invest in the future of our global brand
8895539 a total of 1 25million londoners are potentially at risk of flooding were going to take specific measures which will allow us to meet the demands of big science but also improve the quality of the urban landscape
8895540 by planting more trees and protecting parks and roof gardens were going to be making london more absorbent to rainfall were going to be doing lots of things to make london better and make the consequences of climate change less baleful
8895541 if you look at some of the developments that went up in the late 80s they didnt have quite enough provision for green space its one of the things ill be considering when i look at big planning applications
8895542 i dont have assistants bodyguards or even a driver because i try and pretend in my own head that this isnt happening
8895543 i think a lot of actresses live in this cotton wool world but im very free spirited and i want to be able to live the life i do

8895547 oui il va falloir nous battre pour promouvoir une soci t de solidarit et ensuite la faire voluer par contre nous ne croyons pas une soci t de loterie que certains voudraient mettre sur pied
8895548 beaucoup de responsables politiques veulent faire croire aux gens quils peuvent gagner peu se soigner mal et un jour devenir riche

8895552 everton have agreed a deal to sign louis saha from manchester united
8895553 the frenchman is set to sign a two year deal with the option for a third year with the blues for an undisclosed fee the move will be completed subject to a medical
8895554 the fears that i have expressed over the last six months have started to come to fruition
8895555 ive obviously voted on quite a number of occasions now for small cuts but we need to act and we probably need to act in larger amounts than that we need to actually get ahead of the game and it appears that we are now behind
8895556 there are clearly signs that they are moving in that direction fairly slowly
8895557 yes rates probably should have started to come down by now but i can understand the uncertainty around that and why as a central bank they would want to err on the side of caution
8895558 we are going to see much more dramatic drops in output
8895559 the way to get out of it is to act by interest rate cuts and fiscal stimulus and other things to try help people who are hurt through this
8895560 sitting by doing nothing is not going to get us out of this and hoping that a knight in shining armour will come and lift us out of this is optimistic in the extreme
8895561 to sit and worry about inflation expectations and what is going to happen to those rather than worry about the fact that the economy is going to go into a recession seems to be misguided
8895562 what we have now is a turning point in many ways certainly you might think of it as a paradigm shift we have a global financial crisis an oil shock coming people with little experience of what is really going on
8895563 the question is whats going to happen in prices in 18 months down the road and the answer is inflation is going to plummet like a rock
8895564 i feel that things i have been fearful about have come to pass and i have actually been pretty accurate in whats coming and i have failed to convince the others mpc members of what is appropriate
8895565 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
8895566 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro l orizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
8895567 ogni santa notte ogni volta che chiudo gli occhi lei li ogni volta che la mia mente vuota lei la occupa oh wiliam quando tu non ci sei io mi sento cos inutile cos debole e lei mi logora dallinterno mi sento come se fossi divisa in miliardi di coriandoli tutti senza senso e tu non so come riesci a dargli quel senso riesci a farmi sentire che esisto quando invece io non so pi chi sono non lo so pi
8895568 ho visto te fra lei sue braccia ho sentito il male che ti ha fatto dalla prima volta che sei entrato in questa stanza penso che questa sia colpa tua
8895569 tu hai risvegliato la parte peggiore di me quella che mi faceva male ho rivisto frammenti del suo e del tuo passato ho visto come la guardavi ed anche se non volevo credere che fossi tu quel ragazzo inconsciamente io invidiavo natalie perch so che non potrai mai guardarmi come guardavi lei
8895570 ho sentito la sua perfidia lei mi perseguita mi dice che non sono niente e che tu gli apparterrai per leternit
8895571 ero gi un vampiro allepoca lei non lo sapeva o almeno io non glielo avevo confessato me ne innamorai perdutamente nellistante i cui la vidi
8895572 era bellissima fui superficiale a limitarmi allapparenza cominciai a frequentare il suo castello ogni giorno ogni notte sorgeva proprio qui questa era la sua stanza
8895573 decisi di dirle la verit ero stupidamente sicuro che lei mi amasse solo ora so quanto mi stessi sbagliando non so come ma venne a conoscenza della mia natura da sola allepoca circolavano strane dicerie sui vampiri si diceva che mangiando le nostre carni si poteva ottenere limmortalit senza linconveniente della dannazione
8895574 ma io non volevo vedere non volevo sentire volevo solo lei lultima sera che la vidi nella sua stanza fui attaccato da un esercito di vampiri allora non potevo pi sfuggire dalla realt
8895575 ero forte ma non cos forte per sfuggire ad un esercito lei era li di fronte a me mentre gli altri mi tenevano in modo che non potessi sfuggire non so come riusc a farsi ubbidire da quei vampiri non so nemmeno cosa promise loro in cambio mi disse il suo desiderio ed il suo intento mi aveva venduto ad una nobile famiglia del tempo in cambio di qualche trancio della mia carne lei voleva limmortalit la bellezza eterna lunica cosa importante per lei mi disse che avrebbe mangiato le miei carni che in questo modo avrebbe esaudito anche il mio desiderio essere parte di lei per sempre capii che era pazza che ero stato uno stupido a cercare qualcosa di cos profondo come lamore in una come lei ale era cos fredda cos vuota
8895576 mi fece rinchiudere nelle segrete del suo palazzo quello fu il suo unico errore piegai le sbarre di quella prigione avevo un solo desiderio ucciderla
8895577 rotornai nelle sue stanze alla mia vista i suoi occhi si riempirono di paura di terrore e ne fui felice perch in qualche modo ero riuscito a fargliprovare almeno unemozione alla fine non fui in grado di ucciderla
8895578 la baciai unultima volta cercando di trasmetterle tutto lodio che avevo tutto il ribrezzo me ne andai e non la rividi mai pi ora so cosa le accadde
8895579 lunica cosa che seppi dopo essermene andato che il suo esercito fin col distruggersi da solo soltanto uno si salv a quello scempio gli augur di subire tutte le pene dellinferno gli promise che lavrebbe perseguitata ovunque in ongi vita qualunque forma avesse assunto lui lavrebbe perseguitata sarebbe stato la sua paura pi grande
8895580 poi mi allontanai cos tanto da quel luogo da questo luogo che lei per me non divenne altro che un amaro ricordo un ricordo nitido del mio orgoglio ferito del mio cuore infranto un ricordo che mi perseguitava ed al quale non potevo sottrarmi la mia punizione per aver assaggiato il frutto proibito poi decisi di tornare ed te che ho incontrato tu risvegliasti tutto quel dolore che mi sembrava di tenere sepolto tu eri identica a lei to odiai per questo ti odiai con tutte le mie forze inizialmente pensavo addirittura che tu fossi lei che in qualche modo era riuscita a restare in vita io lo speravo
8895581 gi non sei nemmeno lontanamente paragonabile a lei per fortuna
8895582 e tu mi portasti qui qui dove tutto era cominciato decisi allora che qui anche tutto sarebbe finito ma tu non eri una normale ragazza di questa epoca
8895583 avvertisti subito la mia presenza e questo mi spavent ma ormai avevo deciso tu mi avresti liberato da tutte le mie pene poi a tutto questo si aggiunse il tuo profumo cos dolce cos intenso e la ciliegina sulla torta pensai sarebbe stato tutto pi semplice naturale io ero il vampiro tu la preda ma i tuoi occhi il tuo modo di fare il dubbio cominci a d insinuarsi nei miei pensieri tu non eri lei mi sentii un mostro eppure capii immediatamente di non essere pi capace di allontanarmi da te tu eri una perfida illusione per me lillusione che natalie fosse ancora li per me che fosse diversa
8895584 avanti avanti fa quello per cui sei venuto quella dannata sera mettiamo fine a questo stupido gioco
8895585 ti sto solo chiedendo di rendere concreto ci che in realt hai gi fatto
8895586 va bene se ci che vuoi far ci per cui venni quella sera
8895587 era per questo che ero venuto quella sera non ti avrei mai morsa
8895588 no resister perch ora tu sei pi importante del mio istinto tu sei pi importante di tutto
8895589 voglio che tu lo sappia non sei come lei tu sei tutto ci che ho sempre desiderato tu sei lamore della mia eternit

8895595 tu sei pi importante di chiunque altro e mi hai regalato
8895596 la gente pensa che la vita sia una strada dritta ma sbaglia la vita un circolo un maledetto cerchio che gira in tondo alla fine ti ritrovi in mano esattamente quello che avevi allinizio e finisci per tornare al luogo da cui sei venuto

8895626 the problem for contemporary liberals is that they really dont understand it applies to them

8895631 this is the ultimate insult for a mother who doted and loved her two children
8895632 how can rachel be allowed rest in peace when this woman is now enjoying the company and companionship of her two boys while she lies in her cold grave
8895633 it looked like such an ordinary scene that youd never think it was a mistress not a mother with the boys it was mind boggling to see
8895634 here was a woman visiting a convicted wife killer and she had the dead womans children with her
8895635 they have remained totally committed to each other and she has never questioned his innocence
8895636 she remains totally besotted with him and is convinced they have a future together
8895637 lowes is not freddie thompsons local the real local drinkers down there like myself were disgusted with what went on
8895638 i want to let it be known that the pub is not like that on a normal night ive been living in that area for 40 years and never seen anything like it
8895639 i knew he was going to be there rumours spread people were talking my family pleaded with me not to go up that night they were worried about me
8895640 but im not going to be put out of my local or change my life for the likes of him
8895641 there were about a hundred of them he freddie thompson was in the lounge
8895642 i would say that at least 98pc of the drinkers there that night dont ever drink there ive only seen freddie himself there on one other occasion ever and im drinking there all through the years
8895643 there was a large crowd there and they were dispersed without incident
8895644 they are very optimistic now that he will make a full recovery but obviously things are not moving as fast as we want them to
8895645 hes not off the ventilator but he is breathing by himself
8895646 when they do reduce the amount of sedative hes on he does seem reactive to touch and his facial expressions are great
8895647 youve got amazing skin it must be the lack of sun and amazing bone structure
8895648 i dont know if its a gaelic thing its important because your face has got to almost mimic the frame of the page
8895649 you have to dress for your climate you have about two days of summer here
8895650 youve got the best fashion at this side of the world with the highest disposable income so you should be splashing out

8895664 when i heard that i was to receive the award i was truly honoured to join the list of formidable recipients of the tom wheatcroft trophy is a rare privilege
8895665 ive never forgotten the wet race at donington in 1993 not so much for the thrashing that ayrton senna gave us but for the fact that the race was privately funded by tom driven by his love and enthusiasm for the motor racing
8895666 it is an honour to be giving the trophy to frank today
8895667 all the recipients of the tom wheatcroft trophy have a long history in the sport and have made a considerable contribution to the industry

8895673 today the costume that i tried on wasnt as crazy but the better shape that i get into they will be a little more sexy and risqu im starting off with maybe a ball gown something a little bit more elegant and a little bit more covered up
8895674 im seeing a slight change in my figure i realize that when i would try to work out really fast that i would be burned out i would work out for two days and then wait a few weeks and then workout for a few days again i decided to stay focused and continuous and i started to see a major change so i think ill start to see a slow progress throughout the whole show

8895703 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8895704 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8895705 brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream

8895707 the crips and bloods are the focus for law enforcement now not only here but around the region because of the violence they perpetrate
8895708 weve started seeing more and more signs of the crips and bloods more bloods than crips
8895709 we are seeing a growing presence in the graffiti the clothing the symbols
8895710 there is some indication of activity in the district based on tagging graffiti and people flying colors and throwing signs
8895711 i think whats difficult to determine at this point is how much of that activity is associated with people who are actually bloods in sanctioned sets and people who are claiming to be affiliated but are not
8895712 they run around saying we are the ravenswood boys and everybody says so what
8895713 but if they say theyre the ravenswood bloods suddenly they have some credibility
8895714 we believe that the 12 executions were an isolated incident and not part of a strategy to destabilize the state
8895715 he is doing fine he is undergoing some checkups the doctors have told us that absolutely there is no cause for concern
8895716 we did not kill up to 90 civilians as has been alleged
8895717 ive seen the account stated from both the u n and certainly from the afghan government ive also seen it discussed that in fact that didnt happen
8895718 we know that when collateral damage occurs that it really does set us back so we work exceptionally hard to make sure that doesnt happen
8895719 were looking to do that as rapidly as we can
8895720 i have spent long periods of time with him in the past two years hes been alert hes been steady
8895721 the late prime minister bhutto or her husband or it was a joint account
8895722 i think hes better than many of the others out there plus he was the husband of benazir bhutto who dreamed of a prosperous pakistan hell live out her dream or at least hell try
8895723 he may be an expert in darwinian politics but people perceive a sheer lack of leadership qualities
8895724 if we come to the irrevocable conclusion that we should have an election its not because we have polls that are any different than anybody else
8895725 its because that while weve had 2 1 2 years of government all the signs indicate that this parliament is at the end of its usefulness
8895726 are not 99 of all wars started by big governments

8895729 it said shooting came from three ethnic georgian villages but georgia blamed the separatists for provoking the clashes
8895730 this is another attempt by the separatist side to involve georgia in a military conflict
8895731 separatists opened fire at the two georgian villages of prisi and tamarasheni
8895732 tbilisi earlier said the shelling of south ossetias capital tskhinvali and a neighboring village had been provoked by the rebel region south ossetias leader said monday at least 300 north ossetians had already arrived in the breakaway region with up to 2 000 expected
8895733 a georgian armoured personnel carrier was destroyed by south ossetian militants near the village of avnevi one hour ago and three georgian peacekeepers were wounded as a result
8895734 that scenario started unfolding in south ossetia in late july by august 6 and 7 heavily armed proxy troops opened fire on georgian villages while the secessionist authorities refused to talk with tbilisi the attacking forces began destroying the transmission antennae of georgian mobile telephone systems arms and paramilitary groups poured in from russia to south ossetia through the russian controlled roki tunnel russian officials in georgia claimed that the attacking forces were out of russias control officials in moscow meanwhile justified the attacks directly and indirectly by accusing georgia of aggression interfax itar tass russian television august 4 7

8895765 im not in any way downcast because i feel weve done our job
8895766 we put our minds to it that we did it in the utmost good faith we have a lot of respect for the employees and we dont want a strike but at the same time we feel that the offer is extremely fair and in fact the people that i talk to say its better than most employment relationships that they have
8895767 the issues are mainly money at this point theres still a few issues on the table the main one being monetary
8895768 were trying to get enough of a wage increase to protect us against that inflation rate and i think that most experts agree that going ahead its not going to get any better
8895769 at least somewhere near that you know threes wont do it when the cost of living is going up over four
8895770 weve got a fairly basic contract at the port authority the benefits are not bad and the pensions are not bad because they were with the federal government system and the rest of the contract is pretty basic
8895771 my take on it is if they make money and they send it back to prime minister stephen harper and the federal government rather than giving an adequate wage to their employees who are a very integral part of the success down there

8895806 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8895807 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8895808 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8895809 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8895810 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8895811 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8895812 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop

8895814 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8895815 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8895816 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8895817 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8895818 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with

8895846 there is real hope that in the future we can grow billions of blood cells at will to treat blood related disorders and just as critically if not more so we
8895847 but were very pleasantly surprised to discover it as a beacon for finding the earliest blood stem cells known as well as new ways to find and manipulate this marker to make them grow
8895848 we can make lots and lots of blood cells from human stem cells for transfusions regenerate new vascular trees for heart diseases as well as create test tube factories for making transplantable blood cells that treat diseases
8895849 we are very far from treatment but this is a big step
8895850 proving that we can directly measure amyloid beta in the human brain is an important step forward for both clinical and basic research and that may be true not just in alzheimer s disease but also in other serious neurological disorders

8895890 these are all strong indications that t costata may be the earliest example of marine overexploitation
8895891 our discovery that t costata was already on a trajectory of decline prior to this period corroborates this hypothesis by providing the first circumstantial evidence that humans were not only using but also depleting reef resources making t costata the likely earliest victim of anthropogenic degradation of coral reefs
8895892 declining marine and terrestrial resources by human and climatic factors respectively may have acted in concert to thwart the precocious but short lived colonization of the near east by anatomically modern but technologically primitive humans at the end of the last interglacial

8896142 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8896143 we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise that american promise
8896144 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring
8896145 specific bold solutions and optimistic vision for our nation and our childrens future
8896146 its very clear to me and very clear to him that the appropriate thing is for him to stand aside from his portfolios while the serious fraud office conducts its investigation
8896147 ill show you and ill show the serious fraud office much quicker than you think
8896148 whats winston peters crime now why are you all calling for my head now whats your evidence now because you started the allegations
8896149 the money is shown very clearly being receipted from those donors and the money has been expended in respect of new zealand first
8896150 i am absolutely angered at the way people have prejudged these matters particularly mr key if hes hoping to lead this country one would hope that he will be fairer in matters relating to state than he has been fair to winston peters
8896151 despite all the promises even as late as this morning that he would be able to provide answers to the prime minister accounted for nothing and really now that hes stepped aside its actually helen clark that i think that has got to start answering some questions her self
8896152 you dont ask for them to come along but you have to deal with them and i am endeavouring to deal with this in a way which is fair and has some dignity about it
8896153 it will be interesting to hear from the prosecutor when he will be able to have this new indictment
8896154 in terms of finding out about the beginning of the trial that will be vital

8896173 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8896174 in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
8896175 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8896176 why else would he define middleclass as someone making under five million dollars a year
8896177 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8896178 and just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home so must we keep americas promise abroad if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have

8896188 the simultaneous launch of five satellites is not without its challenges commissioning will be performed from both the rapideye ground station in brandenburg and the sstl mission control centre in guildford the five satellites will gradually disperse from each other following separation from the launch vehicle allowing three satellites to be tracked and operated from brandenburg with the remainder under the control of the guildford operators this method of operation offers the most efficient route to achieving the maximum amount of contact time per satellite during the early days of commissioning following launch as the satellites are gradually manoeuvred into position around the orbit during the commissioning phase the brandenburg ground station will assume full control over the constellation
8896189 sstl long ago established the benefits of small satellite constellations and launched the disaster monitoring constellation in 2002 paving the way for a new paradigm in remote sensing the launch of rapideye will fully realise the business potential of constellations the simultaneous build of five satellites is the largest mission so far in terms of maximising and managing production at sstls guildford facilities expert in house engineering and project management teams worked closely with mda streamlining the design build and test of all five satellite platforms

8896213 the brush had been freshly cut along part of the distance between old upton road and about halfway to the power lines behind the grafton flea market the cut branches hadnt wilted yet so i think it was probably no more than a day or two old
8896214 this isnt huge news as brush cutting has been occurring irregularly along the g amp u over the past several months but it is of some interest to know where they had been working recently perhaps in preparation for roadbed maintenance i e tie replacement in earnest
8896215 that curious area of about 20 or so ties just south of old upton road where the ties seem to have been recently replaced
8896216 just how recently isnt clear the ballast beside them didnt appear to have been recently disturbed and i did see a blade or two of crabgrass peeking out between the ballast stones so im guessing it was at least weeks old but it wasnt years old like every other piece of the g amp u roadbed that ive seen

8896220 the story for 2008 is the value of crop production which at 188 8 billion is forecast to exceed its previous record set in 2007 by 38 billion a 25 percent increase prices of major crops corn soybeans wheat were trending upward in late 2007 and continued doing so in the first part of 2008
8896221 commodity prices continued to surge in the early months of 2008 and are expected to remain relatively high throughout 2008 even though they have backed off their highs for the year corn production is projected to be the second highest on record and soybean graph is projected to be the fourth highest on record consequently with large harvests to sell at high prices the outlook for the farm economy as a whole is for another good year in 2008 driven by strong demand for feed crops oilseeds and food grains
8896222 annual crop cash receipts are expected to increase by 29 percent in 2008 with increases anticipated for all crop types except cotton ethanol demand a cheap dollar and good overall production conditions for most crops are expected to create record sales in 2008
8896223 direct government payments are expected to total 13 2 billion in 2008 up from 11 9 billion in 2007 related graph if realized this level would be 19 percent below the 5 year average for 2003 07 payments under the direct and countercyclical program in 2008 are forecast at 5 27 billion a 4 percent increase from 2007 direct payment rates are fixed in legislation and are not affected by the level of program crop prices
8896224 countercyclical payments are expected to decrease from 1 2 billion in 2007 to 957 million in 2008 this follows a large decrease in 2007 in 2006 and 2007 only upland cotton and peanuts received payments this is quite a change from previous crop years when more than half the payments for 2004 and 2005 were to corn
8896225 marketing loan benefits including loan deficiency payments marketing loan gains and certificate exchange gains are projected at 7 million in 2008 down from 1 1 billion in 2007 in 2007 upland cotton producers received almost 99 percent of total marketing loan benefits of which 95 percent were certificate exchange gains in 2008 only wool mohair and pelts are expected to realize marketing loan benefits because at current price levels marketing loan benefits are not available to any of the other program crops
8896226 following an increase of 20 billion 8 9 percent in 2007 total production expenses are expected to rise 40 4 billion 15 9 percent in 2008 to a nominal record high 294 8 billion
8896227 if realized expenses will constitute 76 percent of gross farm income slightly more than in 2007 the 2008 increase will be the sixth straight since 2002 and during the period total expenses have been climbing at an increasing rate related graph
8896228 fiscal 2009 agricultural exports are forecast at 113 billion down 1 billion from the revised 2008 estimate lower grain exports are offset by gains for all other product categories which reach record highs as foreign wheat production recovers greater competition lowers u s wheat exports by 3 6 billion a large increase in feed quality wheat supply also replaces u s corn in some markets world grain demand remains strong and global markets are tight with little stock rebuilding u s soybean exports fall 4 million tons due to reduced soybean supply but strong demand and tight markets raise value supported by large stocks cotton exports rise 1 1 billion strong demand and competitive prices support gains for horticultural and animal product exports
8896229 world growth has slowed due to record high energy prices higher inflation and the spillover of the u s and european real estate crises into world financial markets the sharply weaker dollar will partially offset the impact of slower world growth and higher inflation on the economic environment facing u s trade the net result is a modestly more favorable situation for farm export growth in 2008 than expected earlier this year
8896230 the dollar exchange rate continues to be a major driver of u s agricultural trade
8896231 u s economic growth accelerated from april to june as taxpayers spent their federal rebate checks and the government reported yesterday
8896232 according to new data from the commerce department gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 3 3 percent in the second quarter of the year the fastest rate since mid 2007 the department had initially estimated annualized growth for the period to be 1 9 percent but more complete data particularly on exports by u s companies showed the economy to be growing faster
8896233 as trade kept the us economy afloat amid rising unemployment a deep housing crisis and turmoil on wall street this year much attention has been paid to americas booming exports
8896234 both in agriculture and some areas of manufacturing us producers of goods have benefited from strong growth overseas which has boosted international demand along with the weak dollar which has made us producers more competitive on price
8896235 but surging exports are only half the story just as importantly if not more americas import economy has been losing steam as us consumers are retrenching during the downturn and shifting away from imported goods that have become more expensive another effect of the weak dollar
8896236 southeast asian nations reached free trade deals with india australia and new zealand and aimed to seal an investment pact with china while economic ministers from 16 regional states agreed to pursue broader free trade deals that could stretch from india to new zealand in the coming years
8896237 at the same time the ministers from the association of southeast asian nations and six other countries vowed thursday to intensify efforts to get the fractured doha round of trade talks at the world trade organization back on track
8896238 the effective end of these complex multilateral trade negotiations is indeed as messrs lamy and mandelson say a collective failure by the global community but the recriminations inside the eu which is supposed to have a common commercial policy will continue to poison the atmosphere in brussels and more pointedly to mar the unions attempt to shift spending away from agricultural support towards industrial productivity

8896242 implementation is going really well he told the des moines register in an interview

8896342 because it can be hard to understand healthcare professionals friends and relatives sometimes mistakenly regard people who self harm with mistrust or fear and see their behaviour as attention seeking and manipulative
8896343 experiences like these traumatic experiences in childhood abuse etc erode self esteem emotions that have no outlet may be buried and blocked completely out of awareness if a trusted adult betrays or abuses them and there are no other witnesses children will often blame themselves they turn their anger inwards by the time they become adults self injury can be a way of expressing their pain punishing themselves and keeping memories at bay there is often an absence of pain during the act of self injury rather like the absence of sensation that often occurs during abuse or trauma the body produces natural opiates which numb it and mask the emotions so that little is felt or realised consciously a badly traumatised person may end up feeling quite detached from their feelings and their body some may injure themselves to maintain that sense of being separate and to convince themselves that they arent vulnerable others may injure themselves in order to feel something and know that they are real and alive
8896344 whether someone wants to live or die may seem to be a straightforward choice but some people are suspended in a grey state of survival where choices and decisions are kept on hold this is where self harm happens for those who self harm surviving is subject to rigid controls feelings are suppressed for fear of what may lie behind them

8896389 some people say that ray tracing is beautiful and rasterizing is ugly
8896390 i say both are ugly in their own way common rasterized 3d graphic is fast indeed but requires some effort for visual special effects

8896392 my advice to all graphics experts use both systems rendering and ray tracing

8896395 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8896396 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8896397 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
8896398 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
8896399 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8896400 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8896401 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8896402 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8896403 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8896404 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8896405 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8896406 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8896407 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8896408 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8896409 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8896410 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8896411 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8896412 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8896413 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8896414 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8896415 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8896416 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8896417 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

8896426 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8896427 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8896428 now we have our own asic we can build it into a storage blade a raid blade its a perfect match for adaptec
8896429 as we build out our i o strategy advancing i o performance while integrating additional controller based system functionality beyond raid the assets we will obtain through this acquisition will become even more valuable
8896430 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8896431 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8896432 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8896433 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8896434 ibm is integrating this ssd technology with systems and applications quicksilver is a significant step forward in this comprehensive systems strategy this is not about replacing todays hard disk drive with a new form factor this is about having a complete end to end systems approach and thats not something emc hp or sun can match

8896441 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8896442 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8896443 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

8896448 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8896449 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8896450 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8896451 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8896452 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

8896454 as far as local people are concerned this trunk road is unwanted and unnecessary
8896455 were opposing this scheme to put a trunk road right through the ancient and historic parish of pendoylan which will sever the ely valley which is scheduled as an area of special countryside and also contains sights of special scientific interest
8896456 this is an area of special scientific interest its an area of special natural beauty registered as such and we all know anyone of us who want to make the slightest change to our houses that that is enforced very strictly
8896457 we want to know why the rules are enforced very strictly against local inhabitants and yet the assembly government are proposing to ignore their own regulations and drive a road through this beautiful valley which will scar it forever

8896459 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8896460 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8896461 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8896462 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8896463 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8896464 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8896465 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8896466 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8896467 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8896468 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8896469 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

8896479 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

8896481 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8896482 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8896483 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

8896485 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula

8896491 mr robinson said he wanted an immediate executive meeting to deal with the issue before it becomes a matter for the courts
8896492 i think people have become complacent and they have not understood what would happen if an economy starts to slow fast if firms start to close what we have now is a turning point in many ways certainly you might think of it as a paradigm shift we have a global financial crisis an oil shock coming and people with little experience of what is really going on

8896495 what is needed from the devolved administration at stormont is a set of policies to take account of the different population profiles in the catholic and protestant communities to answer their different needs and stop following the outdated nio mindset of trying to pretend that everything here would be ok if everyone started behaving as if they lived in england
8896496 in january five north belfast protestant clergy wrote to the unionist oriented news letter complaining of the failure of the executive to tackle sectarianism they wrote we have poor inter community relationships effective apartheid in housing across our villages towns and cities community division exemplified in but not confined to the physical structures of peace walls slow pace of reconciliation sectarianism and fractured educational provision our real angst is that a suggested programme for government almost totally fails to acknowledge these profoundly difficult issues exist the response from the dup junior minister in ofmdfm mr donaldson was that power sharing was the shared interpretation which seemed to confuse politics as means with the ends it aimed to realise the draft programme for government had significantly replaced the language of a shared future with a better future inline with its prioritisation of the economy a much more convivial focus for members of the political class than the challenge of tackling the communal divisions in which they were so deeply implicated the revised pfg32 published by messrs paisley and mcguinness introduced the clumsy circumlocution of a shared and better future
8896497 is a matter the government has to consider in due course but we are not at that point in our discussions at all yet the point of discussion we are at at the moment is examining the outcome of the referendum and obviously there will be a lot meetings with eu colleagues between now and the end of the year where it will be discussed further with them so its not just a matter for our own personal consideration or national consideration it is a matter we have to discuss with colleagues as well

8896500 even in these times when all the talk is of putting history behind us the easiest way to tell the difference between the irish and the english is to utter the word
8896501 i was myself assaulted and received death threats the depth of hatred that still exists in ireland is matched only by unawareness in non catholic english circles of what cromwell did in ireland i am reminded of gk chestertons remark that the tragedy of the english conquest of ireland in the 17th century is that the irish can never forget it and the english can never remember it
8896502 it was in accordance with the laws of war but it went far beyond what any general had done in england
8896503 this was ethnic cleansing on a scale undreamt of by slobodan milosevic
8896504 reverence for cromwell was one of the few socialist traditions that survived the transition from old to new labour

8896506 until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved
8896507 it is increasingly a manifestation of republican frustration at the failure of sinn f in to deliver what it promised to its own movement
8896508 nationalists and republicans will once again be disappointed by the attitude being displayed by the sdlp
8896509 any commitments that were given by the government to sinn f in are a matter for the government but the dup made the situation perfectly clear before we left st andrews that we had not agreed to any dates for the transfer of powers
8896510 i say again that until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved it should not be taking on more especially a portfolio as contentious as justice
8896511 i was outside the family home when the raid began and i was inside immediately afterwards speaking with the family who are close friends of mine the reality of the ruc psni was here for all to see in broad daylight and the residents of this estate remain justifiably suspicious of the force
8896512 most accounts agree that it was south ossetian separatists who committed the first act of escalation when they blew up a georgian military vehicle on august 1 wounding five georgian peacekeeping troops georgia responded in kind killing six south ossetian militiamen
8896513 capt ivanov and eduard kokoity the pro moscow president of south ossetia say they held a meeting that day between marat kulakhmetov commander of the russian peacekeeping forces and temur yakobashvili the georgian minister for re integration whose job is to deal with the breakaway regions
8896514 i would like to address those who are now shooting at georgian policemen i want to say with full responsibility that several hours ago i reached a very difficult decision not to respond with fire this was no use however and the fighting escalated

8896694 we would not be showing contempt for the constitution wed be protecting the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation
8896695 and we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
8896696 we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again

8896754 wir k nnen die kombination aus explodierenden energiepreisen und zwei stellig gestiegenen personalkosten infolge des j ngsten tarifabschlusses allein durch effizienzsteigerungen nicht mehr kompensieren
8896755 wir haben uns jedoch f r einen moderaten anstieg der fahrpreise entschieden um auch weiterhin attraktive komfortable und umweltgerechte mobilit t f r jedermann zu erm glichen zieht man in betracht dass 81 prozent aller db fahrscheine im regionalverkehr im fernverkehr sogar 89 prozent rabattiert sind f llt die preiserh hung f r den gr ten teil unserer kunden gering aus
8896756 da inzwischen knapp 60 prozent der fahrkarten im internet oder am automaten gekauft werden ndert sich f r die mehrheit unserer kunden in sachen zuschlagsfreiheit also nichts
8896757 unter dem strich fallen die kostensteigerungen f r bahnfahrer deutlich geringer aus als f r autofahrer oder flugreisende zudem haben wir trotz der enormen zus tzlichen kostenbelastung durch den tarifabschluss anfang dieses jahres unsere zusage eingehalten unterj hrig die preise stabil zu halten

8896851 the trick so many people learn and that i am reluctant to learn is to be hurt and cover it up and pretend that everything is ok all the time when its not
8896852 i dont like to act in my personal life i like to be straightforward look i started this very young and i havent had media training so go figure
8896853 try new things i get quite fed up being on a film set day after day six days a week it can get to be a grind i want to have what i do always feel fresh and new and this play does to me i mean a film adaptation is not necessarily my first choice for the first piece of theatre ive done in 12 years but the script was so impressive and i wanted to show myself that i could do it still basically i have a short attention span so itll be good for me to try and stay in one space doing the same thing for four months
8896854 i viewed myself as just a young actor trying to figure out how to do well and you know making mistakes and learning and growing
8896855 and then i happened to be picked up for a certain movie and they let the publicity machine go wild and i ended up at the centre of that and i was billed as a lot of things that i never claimed to be
8896856 fame was initially this kind of blunt tool that was thrust into my hands very young
8896857 yeah that was pretty much the end of that relationship
8896858 but i wasnt like tarantino i was like the comic store guy from the simpsons that was more me it was pretty much the only job i could hold down
8896859 now ive figured out that you can use it to raise awareness for certain charities certain issues but it was living in a goldfish bowl that made it so difficult some people would say thats a plus but its not something i can do ive retreated from this idea of chasing fame its too much for me to handle

8897184 but we cant really ask the mayor to miss out on all the new years eve fun not after all hes been through

8897187 we beschikken straks bijvoorbeeld over een modern en goed geoutilleerd datacenter ook de look en feel van het nieuwe kantoor wordt heel bijzonder we hebben architect gerben van der kooi en binnenhuisarchitect henk vos ingeschakeld en we zijn erg enthousiast over het resultaat we kijken er naar uit om straks te werken vanuit een kantoor met een professionele uitstraling en een zeer prettige werkomgeving
8897188 or possibly a long way behind either way i just dont think the town was ready for kates vision of poetry that didnt necessarily abide by the rules im all for rules as my ready adherence to small business tax laws illustrates but sometimes you just have to push the boundaries dont you
8897189 i dont want to oversell it but this show is going to redefine the entire medium of radio
8897190 the town marathon will start at noon with a mid afternoon break for jennie garths long awaited junior ju jitsu demonstration featuring a face off between abigail breslin brown belt and dakota fanning belt being used as a dog lead
8897191 after the girls demonstration the town will finally hold a bbq bash for local architect paul mccartney before the marathon continues running into the opening of the new town canal followed by new years eve celebrations
8897192 the next agenda must be forged through starting with the pressures and the struggles that people face in their own lives
8897193 at its most basic this means a clearer story about two things the limits of the market and the new frontiers of the welfare state old labour was hostile to the market new labour has arguably been too deferential to it
8897194 yet beneath camerons rhetoric lies the basic philosophy that failed britain in the past
8897195 the tories demand responsibility without offering support they appeal for fraternity without any real belief in equality they have finally noticed society but remain implacably hostile to the state
8897196 yo estar con vosotros siempre hasta la consumaci n del mundo
8897197 t eres pedro y sobre esta piedra edificar mi iglesia
8897198 yo he rogado por ti a fin que no desfallezca tu fe y t una vez convertido confirma a tus hermanos
8897199 con aprobaci n del sagrado concilio ense amos y definimos ser dogma divinamente revelado que el romano pont fice cuando habla ex c tedra esto es cuando cumpliendo su cargo de pastor y doctor de todos los cristianos define por su suprema autoridad apost lica que una doctrina sobre la fe y las costumbres debe ser sostenida por la iglesia universal por la asistencia divina que le fue prometida en la persona del bienaventurado pedro goza de aquella infalibilidad de que el redentor divino quiso que estuviera provista su iglesia en la definici n de la doctrina sobre la fe y las costumbres y por tanto que las definiciones del romano pont fice son irreformables por s mismas y no por el consentimiento de la iglesia
8897200 el grado supremo de participaci n en la autoridad de cristo est asegurado por el carisma de la infalibilidad esta se extiende a todo el dep sito de la revelaci n divina se extiende tambi n a todos los elementos de doctrina comprendida la moral sin los cuales las verdades salv ficas de la fe no pueden ser salvaguardadas expuestas u observadas
8897201 este santo s nodo el concilio vaticano ii precisa que en la iglesia solamente han de mantenerse como materia de fe y costumbres aquellas cosas que l declare manifiestamente como tales
8897202 que se la coloque siempre ante el dilema de tomar una decisi n magisterial taxativa o callar absolutamente
8897203 no s si lo que os estoy diciendo es correcto teol gicamente
8897204 jo jo is epileptic he has seizures we dont do drugs

8897207 if your athletes life depended on getting in top shape in record time what would be the most important thing you would do
8897208 we kiezen bewust voor de term markt en niet voor winkel
8897209 we willen ontwikkelaars een open en onbelemmerde omgeving bieden om hun producten aan te bieden
8897210 ive just got to decide when and if at the moment there is nothing concrete anywhere
8897211 there has been some inquiry i have had a couple of discussions a couple with my boss at cricket south africa everybody knows exactly where they stand ive been open and honest with everyone ive spoken to
8897212 at the end of this tour ill just need some time off and reflect on where i want to go in my career after april next year
8897213 if anything happens it is not going to happen until after australia thats where my contract goes to and where my focus is
8897214 australia was always the culmination of mine and graemes planning that was our target my thought process is entirely on that
8897215 i see our one day side now where we were with our test team two years ago
8897216 its going to be a work in progress and it has to be driven to the next world cup i dont think we are the one day side we were and we are going to have to live with that
8897217 were probably not number two in the world at the moment as the rankings suggest
8897218 weve lost depth weve lost the ability to hit the ball out of the ground at the back end of our innings weve lost a key bowler up front with the new ball weve lost a key bowler at the death
8897219 we need guys to come in and weve got to find the right balance and the right personnel
8897220 nasa got the go ahead thursday to resume stacking shuttle atlantis and the agency is aiming to move the vehicle out to its kennedy space center launch pad early tuesday if the weather cooperates the agency also is keeping close tabs on two storms that could threaten nasas shuttle homeport or an external tank factory and an engine test center that are located along the gulf coast
8897221 i think eh um ill have my staff get back to you on that
8897222 but we dont need to elect a rock star we need a serious minded human being who can help us solve the serious problems especially here in michigan
8897223 protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education keep our water clean and our toys safe invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology
8897224 its not a criminal case the burden of proof is the governor must be convinced
8897225 the educational power of gaming of this nature is all too often underestimated
8897226 and it not only greatly improves their knowledge of history but it sharpens their arithmetical skills and their understanding of the tactical opportunities so often available in life
8897227 i have thoroughly enjoyed being part of the project and i definitely think it will increase the profile of the town it is a great idea to further the trusts cause
8897228 directly impact upon the financial health of the council and these groups need a great focus on sound financial management so that the agreed 2008 09 budget can be adhered to
8897229 however it is in a good financial position to face the challenges that lie ahead
8897230 this is a good report in so far as we are in a fairly stable and financially sound situation
8897231 this last fiscal year did have its ups and downs a lot of the expenditure of this council is to do with the bricks and mortar that were building such as the 50 million of public money weve invested in the last year
8897232 labours legacy to the current administration is a balance of over 10 million pounds
8897233 this is a fantastic resource for east lothian the council is in a luxurious position of being awash with money
8897234 if we listened to councillor innes youd think the streets were paved with gold
8897235 frankly the money we receive is far less than the money we need to spend
8897236 education and childrens services directly overspent as a result of the choices made by schools to spend their reserves earmarked for devolved school management
8897237 there are headteachers throughout east lothian who had to be able to make huge savings in their budget
8897238 now the incentive for the headteacher to do that is not there because any more surplus than 1 5 per cent is lost
8897239 i find it difficult to follow the logic of councillor hampshires explanation
8897240 they were taking more savings then but the money was there to be spent on the education of the children of east lothian
8897241 this was a huge sum of money left over that could have been spent on the children and families of east lothian
8897242 quite often when im called out its just a false alarm so when i arrived to find police cars and saw the damage i got quite a shock
8897243 i dont need any policeman to tell me that they knew exactly what they were looking for
8897244 they were specific about taking the latest items that could easily be sold on
8897245 its very frustrating to imagine that customers come in and we give them the very best and courteous service only for one of them to have been casing the joint
8897246 we will have to cover the costs of increasing security and our insurance premiums are likely to be hit
8897247 people have been really surprised that in a sleepy little village like gullane people have to take such extreme measures to protect their property
8897248 when i first got the email informing me of the cost i was so angry
8897249 last year we paid a group of people to erect the bunting and it only cost us around 250
8897250 im very happy to have been chosen and am very much looking forward to serving the people of tranent
8897251 obviously ive got to know them a little bit over the past year and i know that they are a very warm and welcoming congregation
8897252 i felt god was calling me to serve him in another way
8897253 she was very good on sunday and people really enjoyed the service
8897254 around 70 people voted for her to stay on as minister
8897255 were really looking forward to having her on board as the new minister
8897256 there has been a discernible drop in the number of nuisance and anti social behaviour calls that we would receive at this time of the year
8897257 one of our priorities is to engage more with youth if you think about how many of our daily calls are taken up with youth problems it makes sense to do so
8897258 we are definitely promoting youth facilities and also trying to get youths involved in other initiatives like the community and police partnership capp forum
8897259 we do not say if you have been drinking never darken our door because it is safer that young people know they have somewhere to go if they feel unwell or have found themselves in a spot of trouble
8897260 it would take a lot of the pressure off ourselves in terms of rents and overheads and also the police
8897261 i wrote in 2006 to the licensing committee to complain about the noise from the open bar door and since then have complained a number of times
8897262 the whole immediate area becomes part of the pub when that door is open
8897263 ive lived here 30 years and not had a problem but now i have a big problem
8897264 the square is littered with cigarette ends just to have that door closed would make such a difference
8897265 the problem was reported to me in the past and im really disappointed that its occurred again but it sounds as if it has never been dealt with
8897266 the publican was visited and we were assured that the door would be kept closed
8897267 if he is not going to take heed in that respect then i think it has to go to the licensing board
8897268 the community council will write to the licensing authority and ask them to visit the premises
8897269 weve been working with environmental health and licensing officers and as far as were concerned this is not a big issue
8897270 we have a policy in place where the door in question is closed at 7pm
8897271 inevitably with the smoking ban in place people are forced to go outside and there can be some chatter
8897272 there was a push to mark last years scouting centenary at the edinburgh festival parade
8897273 much of this was down to north berwick pipe band it is testament to the relationship we enjoy that they were at the forefront of this
8897274 there are many supporters and former members of the band who live in north berwick and further afield i hope they will all turn out to mark the auspicious occasion and cement their connection with the band
8897275 there are still worries and concerns regarding sportplus financial position
8897276 sportplus is a huge consumer of energy and its a worry for us that we wont be able to limit the costs already theres a difficulty emerging with regard to our energy costs
8897277 sends a clear message to the staff of their achievements
8897278 its come much closer to washing its face so to speak and i feel it is in a much healthier state
8897279 im grateful we looked at things like sportplus and didnt set it out as an independent organisation as was suggested a year ago
8897280 the aim of the administration when we had the discussion was to stabilise the financial position of sportplus and thats been done
8897281 during this time we will be carefully monitoring the situation to ascertain if this service meets the needs of the local community and would provide a commercially viable alternative to the way our services are currently offered
8897282 there is already wheelchair access there and its flat from the back wall to the front door its also all on one level thats what i think attracted them post office ltd to this location
8897283 the new operators will have to go some way to beat the previous owner for personal service and courtesy
8897284 the extended opening hours will help people who are working
8897285 and i have to say i am really surprised that we are getting one here especially in the current climate
8897286 this is a great boost for the community because losing that branch was a great inconvenience to the elderly and others
8897287 its probably the only bit of good news in the country regarding post offices with all the closures that are going on
8897288 i did speak to post office ltd but really this has been a campaign run by the community the community council has been pivotal in this as well
8897289 it just goes to show that community campaigns to save post offices can be effective and ultimately successful
8897290 i dont understand her technique but i cant argue with her results id be keen to study her physiology and see if i can understand how she works salma give me a call

8897293 while there are few star rated hotels in shirdi there is a near absence of internationally acceptable three star hotels our project at shirdi aims to bridge this gap by providing all the necessary amenities at moderate tariff

8897302 i firmly believe that it is impossible to speak about music
8897303 our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8897304 america we cannot turn back not with so much work to be done not with so many children to educate and so many veterans to care for not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend
8897305 in a speech filled with policy specifics and some of the toughest swipes he has taken at his opponent in the campaign obama took on the sharp criticisms the gop has leveled against him in recent months and at the same time exhorted the nation to look beyond politics as usual
8897306 if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
8897307 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of
8897308 but i stand before you tonight because all across something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8897309 with an advertisement before and after the democrats address saying
8897310 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8897311 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8897312 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8897313 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8897314 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8897315 we can tell republicans and independents as well as democrats why our nation needs a change from the approach of bush cheney and mccain after they wrecked our economy it is time for a change after they abandoned the search for the terrorists who attacked us and redeployed the troops to invade a nation that did not attack us its time for a change after they abandoned the american principle first laid down by general george washington when he prohibited the torture of captives because it would bring in his words shame disgrace and ruin to our nation its time for a change
8897316 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8897317 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8897318 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8897319 why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5 million a year how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than 100 million americans how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax peoples benefits or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college or a plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8897320 it is a testament to the ability of a committed and determined people to make a difference in our society it is a testament to the promise of america
8897321 i think we have more room to grow than mccain
8897322 ucc music video contest for breaking up in the daylight was the one who produced the music video
8897323 on december 2007 we held a contest called the breaking up in daylight music video challenge where the winner got an award and was given the chance to produce an all expense paid music video for one of the artist signed under jype
8897324 the contestant who grabbed our attention was kim eui yun who eventually won the contest and was invited to produce the music video for this time which is thought of as wonder girls second title track after so hot
8897325 the music video is about the wonder girls members reading a book titled this time a complicated love story between a designer and a mannequin
8897326 this time is a bright ballad song so we decided to reflect the mood of the song by using only soft colors in the video
8897327 im still an amateur but i want to thank jype for giving me the chance to debut as a music video director and making my dreams come true
8897328 so rika chan landlady saika san how are you fine ladies doing today
8897329 im full its great to have you girls here although that yui girl forgot what she came for in the first place
8897330 id like to join another group maybe something like morning musume but smaller not to say i dont think i could handle a solo career if tsunku and the agency believe in me then thats pretty much all the reason i need to believe in myself desu ne they wouldnt waste their time on somene if they didnt have even the slightest bit of talent
8897331 a the good old days being in groups its really sad how they make shuffle groups that dont last very long
8897332 nee yui chan wouldnt it be great to be in a group together reina chan too
8897333 a the good old days being in groups its really sad how they make shuffle groups that dont last very long
8897334 nee yui chan wouldnt it be great to be in a group together reina chan too
8897335 i suppose so i guess i was so excited going off with reina chan that i just plain forgot
8897336 ano makippe maybe if we do our best here give it our all and put up a good face for the cameras our fans and for the agency he might give us more to do maybe even put us in a group he might even be testing us after all you have to admit the combos are kind of odd its not all gaki kame tsuji kago ishi yossie koha michi hes not even going by generation with you if i remember correctly maybe hes checking to see if were compatible to re instate the shuffles
8897337 how much would you love re doing something like that or doing something similar
8897338 gomen maki chan i didnt know this was in here
8897339 how much would you love re doing something like that or doing something similar
8897340 natsukashi na i miss the good old days of course id love to do it again thats something i can never pass up
8897341 gomen maki chan i didnt know this was in here
8897342 just shows us where we need to direct our disaster preparedness effort
8897343 the findings in this report will aid public health and emergency preparedness efforts and may help reduce the mortality burden in future natural disasters
8897344 the economic structure has been optimized the governments working efficiency had been raised and peoples living standards have improved
8897345 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
8897346 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8897347 what the people heard people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8897348 im crying because i was around when martin luther king died and when john f kennedy died and its a long time since then and a long time to get back the dream
8897349 this is history i will tell my grandchildren about this
8897350 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8897351 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8897352 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8897353 i worked on the hillary clinton campaign for a year and ive come to the realization that hes the one to change this country
8897354 but lets hope that americans are going to address the problems that are bedeviling the country
8897355 thank you for ordering your drinks will be up in a few minutes
8897356 didnt you say a while ago that you wanted to do a solo of indigo blue love
8897357 you fell asleep lets go get changed then you can sleep until the cows come home
8897358 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8897359 eight years in his state legislature in springfield illinois and one term in congress
8897360 i am much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
8897361 probably was shaped more by his fathers absence than his presence
8897362 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8897363 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8897364 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this tonight i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8897365 next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8897366 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under five million dollars a year how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than 100m americans its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8897367 born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own
8897368 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8897369 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8897370 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8897371 but what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes
8897372 because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
8897373 you have shown what history teaches us that at defining moments like this one the change we need doesnt come from washington change comes to washington
8897374 it is that promise that forty five years ago today brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream the men and women who gathered there couldve heard many things they couldve heard words of anger and discord they couldve been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred but what the people heard instead people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one we cannot walk alone the preacher cried and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back america we cannot turn back not with so much work to be done not with so many children to educate and so many veterans to care for not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess thank you god bless you and god bless the united states of america
8897375 this has been the most aggressive speech of the week and the most substantive ive seen obama give its not a thematic address its not about hope or values or the universality of the american experience of the illusory obstacles that divide us its concrete its about the failure of the republican party and the promises of the democratic party
8897376 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8897377 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed but i wanted to stop and say congratulations tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator obama job well done
8897378 i teared up and im no a cryer the symbolism of him being here its like the whole kennedy era came back and now we have the same spirit as president jack kennedy as martin luther king alive and well it gives me chills to say those words
8897379 and if it hadnt been such a success it would have looked really bad
8897380 finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8897381 there are no signs thus far that contracts and approved deliveries will not be adhered to
8897382 it is believed that executives from lead producer lukoil have been put on weekend alert
8897383 told to be ready to cut off supplies as soon as monday
8897384 differences revolve around a schedule of the withdrawal of us forces from iraq as well as their powers and the description of these troops
8897385 although the iraqi delegation has insisted on that date the americans have some reservations over it
8897386 i came to the west coast and this became my adopted home its where i began to discover what i wanted to say musically in a more clear fashion than i would have probably been able to in nashville the things that went on out here were outside the mainstream and it allowed me to evolve in a different way
8897387 at the time i was very drawn to the beacon that emmylou harris was acting as in 1976 77
8897388 there was a still flourishing country rock music scene the eagles were at the pinnacle of their success and emmylou had her hot band and was basing it out of southern california that drew me to the west coast
8897389 and there was a great tradition of country music that kept me here even johnny cash lived out here
8897390 so i heard buck really on pop radio first then listened to the stuff on country radio later
8897391 under your spell again that had a magic to it
8897392 the west coast element is what drew me here there was a slightly more raw sound more affinity for rock n roll
8897393 once i got on the west coast the natural thing was using the band you used in the studio onstage and it brought out a visceral quality thats what bucks records had that nashville records didnt carry over into the 60s it was there in the 50s with hank sr s albums but it got lost
8897394 the west coast had more of that jet age interpretation of that a more migratory john steinbeck expression of that you have with buck owens the godfather of country rock because what he was doing in a honky tonk musical setting were the things that converted traditional country music to the rock n roll generation the nashville sound had become more produced in a pop sense and less accessible to a rock audience
8897395 i never felt it was my right to usurp ownership
8897396 i didnt consider covering his songs while he was alive because he was performing them so well until the weekend he died in march of 2006 it didnt seem appropriate to do his material
8897397 but only for the remainder of that tour for those few weeks
8897398 secured by pledged collateral consisting of reimbursement premiums and earnings emergency assessments and investment earnings from the florida hurricane catastrophe fund finance corp
8897399 but heavy rains disrupted the rescue and relief operations since thursday adding to the woes of thousands who are struggling to survive and spending nights on roofs railway tracks and canal embankments
8897400 the government has just given us a sheet of plastic to protect ourselves from the rain
8897401 people are going to die and nobody is going to rescue them
8897402 there is no government in jerusalem that would ever reconcile itself to a nuclear iran when it is clear iran is on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons an israeli military strike to prevent this will be seriously considered
8897403 sane cheap and the only option that does not necessitate bloodshed
8897404 its a shame because ido will light all this up
8897405 is like investing in krups steelworks in 1938 its a high risk investment
8897406 americans the british and the germans worry about the direct threat to israel from iran and fear irans potential to share nuclear technology with terrorist groups
8897407 all countries want diplomacy over military action to address this threat the germans oppose military action for historical and cultural reasons and the british do not want another iraq yet the americans are more open to military action especially if a diplomatic solution fails to become a reality
8897408 decent law abiding citizens have had their freedoms suspended in the guise of stopping gun crime
8897409 this problem has everything to do with illegal drugs public housing and primarily the ruthless gangs who emanate from those dwellings and make huge profits from the procurement and sale of illegal drugs
8897410 suit makers cant withstand the competition and the downturn in the economy at the same time
8897411 the overall dress up market has changed dramatically in the past 10 years
8897412 if volume is down and the price is down retailers have an additional problem
8897413 people are balking at the prices they are bargaining with me but they do want my product in their stores
8897414 a lot of them vendors are sitting with merchandise they want to sell
8897415 we think this is the right time to gain market share through innovation
8897416 the second we started school days at the bass player event i knew it was historical for us and the audience marcus and victor are so intuitive and we each found our range marcus was slamming down the groove and victor started playing these harmonics chords and i was like man this is so bad ass when you have that amount of knowledge respect and love it always creates clarity in the music
8897417 to work with stanley and marcus has been a dream come true for me weve each brought in tunes for the cd that allow plenty of space and interpretation from the other guys its been pretty funny with marcus and i imitating each other and doing our stanley licks best of all the project is very musical the bass heroics are there but people are going to be surprised at how musical it is
8897418 that was important we didnt want to just have everyone bangin away at the bass in fact weve had to encourage each other to play with more technique at times the most interesting aspect has been hearing the distinct sound of our basses which people all know from our albums side by side for me its like listening to the history and evolution of the instrument its really amazing
8897419 considering were three guys playing the same instrument its going to be a real revelation for folks youll hear the electric bass in particular with some whole other possibilities its a great new day for the bass
8897420 youre talking about the three giants of their generations i cant wait to hear what those guys come up with
8897421 firmeza ante la amenaza de solbes en financiaci n obama proclama que ha llegado el momento de impulsar

8897424 it was about time that someone started saying that air berlin is not a lcc
8897425 well to the point conclusion do your homework first and then look for a partner
8897426 in your analysis of lcc penetration in hub airports you should some how consider also secondary airports if they are
8897427 i think airlines fly from europe to asia via dubai because of jet fuel price astana has no options to
8897428 ive read the comment about astana as a connection hub for eurasian cross continental flights and wonder what shall astana
8897429 provisionally we will start with three return flights a week but more can be added when we see the demand the new schedule has been agreed in co operation with big danish corporates such as arla foods and dovista a s both of them future customers on this service we have chosen to launch this route as there is a great demand for direct flights from the western part of denmark to poland from many danish companies with subsidiaries in poland in addition we hope billund home of the famous legoland theme park will attract polish families to go on an extended weekend in billund
8897430 we have 35 more seats this year than this time last year so you can see why we are very happy to have the service we do
8897431 we had united express start twice daily services on june 5 to denver previously we had no united services at all and now we have this additional horizon flight between helena billings and seattle additionally this summer skywest added another flight to salt lake city and the service also went from a 50 seat rj to a 70 seat rj on the morning originating flight we have 35 more seats this year than this time last year so you can see why we are very happy to have the service we do

8897439 i remember when mom let me cut open the cookie dough package and put the perfectly symmetrical squares onto the baking sheet
8897440 no one was going to hire a 64 year old man for a good paying job
8897441 but the white guys who usually vote democratic but who sometimes stray over to the republicans we dont have them yet
8897442 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8897443 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8897444 because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from iraq and afghanistan i see my grandfather who signed up after pearl harbor marched in pattons army and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the gi bill
8897445 in the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift i think about my mom who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships
8897446 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8897447 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8897448 more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less
8897449 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this this country is more decent than one where a woman in ohio on the brink of retirement finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work this country is more generous than one where a man in indiana has to pack up the equipment hes worked on for 20 years and watch it shipped off to china and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news we are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty that sits on its hands while a major american city drowns before our eyes tonight i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8897450 its not that john mccain doesnt care its that john mccain doesnt get it
8897451 so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8897452 he said i hate to break it to you peter but having a number of people working on something doesnt really guarantee success microsoft has had thousands of people working on vista and look how that turned out
8897453 estava muito optimista mas de facto este ano a sorte n o quer nada connosco a caixa de velocidades explodiu ao fim de oito quil metros sem ter dado o m nimo sinal que isso poderia suceder muito azar at porque este podia ter sido o rali que me podia colocar ainda mais na frente do campeonato e colocar me em boa posi o para discutir o t tulo pois os dois primeiros perderam muito tempo no primeiro dia e est o fora dos pontos
8897454 at no tempo que perdi n o tive sorte durante a semana com a divis o do tro o grande em dois o dia passou a ter sete especiais em vez de cinco assim acabei por perder 35 minutos quando se esta altera o n o acontecesse teria perdido 25 agora vamos procurar fazer bons tempos e andar r pido para preparar da melhor forma o rali do jap o que este ano ser novo para todos e onde espero pelo menos n o ter azar
8897455 keep a quality service up and running especially in the face of
8897456 ariel sharon has done it again israels new prime minister is accusing the iranians of transferring new long range missiles to lebanon capable so he claims of hitting the centre of israel and accusing syria of using lebanons airports to transfer these fantasy missiles its important to use the word fantasy in the hundreds of miles i travel across lebanon every month i have yet to see a long range missile let alone a transporter satellite pictures would easily identify such a rocket and beirut airport is these days so hide bound with security that you couldnt move a rifle through its terminal

8897460 i cant believe after almost 40 years that theyve been there that im the only one who has done it

8897465 my greatest joy is to see those i lead succeed in what they are called to do
8897466 i hate it when leaders treat those whom they are leading unkindly and with disrespect it greatly bothers me when leaders do not value each individual on their team
8897467 my dad and moms fingerprints are all over my life my dads commitment to prayer simplicity and discipline have marked my life my mom had an ability to work well with just about everyone she also demonstrated how to face lifes challenges with joy and optimism though they are both in heaven their lives influence me just about every day
8897468 the book of philippians has revolutionized my mind alicia choles book anonymous transformed me as a young church planter robert schullers power of positive thinking literally put me on a new track
8897469 my biggest challenge is to take the time required to continue to grow as a person so i can continue to grow as a leader husband father pastor church leader
8897470 to be consistent to be a christ like example to inspire and encourage those i lead to value those i lead
8897471 i see myself growing and flourishing coming along side my children as they raise their families and do their ministries spoiling our grandchildren loving life with my wife debbie
8897472 most on the right were disappointed while many on the left were elated
8897473 this has been the most aggressive speech of the week
8897474 one of the biggest problems the dems have is that the world is always seen through a glass darkly obamas greatest acheivement in his 2004 speech was to make the country feel good about itself but this speech is all about the pain and its very short on specifics on how hell cure it
8897475 it is highly regrettable and frankly astonishing that the nuj is balloting for strike action at a time when the telegraph is creating 40 new jobs for journalists even in the middle of a serious economic downturn
8897476 of course we are making essential changes to our business as well as all media organisations are and are simply asking some production journalists to work a 5 day week like their colleagues the spokeswoman said
8897477 weve made extensive efforts to communicate with all our staff as well as with the nuj well continue to do so
8897478 it is going to be hard to raise capital in the public markets particularly for depository institutions
8897479 i think thats going to drive a lot of private equity deals
8897480 we are negotiating with both and theyre going at the same speed
8897481 we are very pleased with this years results we are hopeful that the momentum we experienced in the second half of the fiscal year will carry forward and help us get through the uncertain economic conditions that lie ahead
8897482 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8897483 standing alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8897484 have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief
8897485 a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what president john kennedy called our intellectual and moral strength
8897486 i do think it was one of the best ever
8897487 he wove the positive case for himself and the negative case against mccain into a functioning whole and the remarkable thing was he also did all the heavy lifting in making the case against mccain
8897488 he took it straight to the republicans and clearly laid down the gauntlet
8897489 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain
8897490 senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year barack obama is still not ready to be president
8897491 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8897492 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8897493 set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8897494 a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8897495 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8897496 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy
8897497 so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8897498 they had to work very very hard to fill that stadium
8897499 kennedy wasnt yet that superstar that he became in the fall campaign
8897500 when the issues arent with you go for celebrity and fanfare 70 000 people in a stadium cheering entertainers enthusing
8897501 its fascinating that the republicans are spinning it into a liability to me thats the most outrageous spin of the year what politician wouldnt be thrilled to have that kind of draw
8897502 its fabulous if somebody thinks they can attract 75 000 cheering people that strikes me as a plus

increasing my load temps by 10c still got the same freeze i have to admit im kind of leaning towards beckbergers suggestion suck it up i havent seen instability anywhere but in blend and ive already finished crysis so its not like im going to be inflicting major stress during normal usage but its starting to become a matter of principle darn it current blue ribbons 0 joined 2 16 2003 status your running 1066 ram so i would up my fsb voltage to 1 4v and also link and sync for better stability odds are your mob is fine and its not the problem problem is your voltages are off scott evga 780i ftw

fsb voltage at 1 3v which is as high as i want to go it seems higher cpu fsb voltage can cause degredation on these 45nm cpus you really should not need that high a cpu fsb voltagage unless you were

temps cpu and cores hover in the 40 50c range im monitoring using everest with tjmax at 95c posts 712 current blue ribbons 3 joined 4 29 2007 ya you will likely need to be in the low to mid 1 3v range on the cpu to get 3 2 just up it a little at a time and see i cant see it needing more than 1 35v as for everest the released value for tjmax is 100c so expect all your temps to be 5c higher intel

can change the tjmax value under preferences to 95c to get an accurate reading that seems to be what most go by as far as your core temps you sound fine most overclockers dont like to see the core temps get beyond 65c while running a stress test like prime 95 small ffts i could probably get 3 60 ghz out of my q9450 but i dont have the headroom temp wise i would need a little more vcore and

8897507 it is legitimate for the people of pakistan to ask whether that story is true or not and what is his response because so far neither the government of pakistan nor mr zardari has responded
8897508 i would humbly request that he should withdraw his candidature in the supreme national interest in the interest of democratic stability and also in the interest of the future prospects of his party
8897509 mr zardari is the pakistan peoples partys unanimous choice and he accepted our request to take the nomination for the position of president
8897510 as far as i know there is no specific threat to his life he has just agreed to accommodate the concerns of the party members who worry about his safety
8897511 if it needs such a huge defence it cant be very good
8897512 our working families are struggling to cope with the rapidly increasing costs of their basic needs especially gasoline heating fuel and food

8897524 older people with any physical vulnerability are about 13 percent more likely than those without one to report verbal mistreatment but are not more likely to report financial mistreatment
8897525 perhaps the respondents are including fairly routine arguments perhaps about money with their spouse sibling or child in their reports or perhaps older adults are more reticent to report negative behavior
8897526 the population of this country is aging and people now live with chronic diseases longer so its important to understand from a health perspective how people are being treated as they age
8897527 our small community banks they didnt write the subprime adjustable rates that are causing all the problems
8897528 that isnt to say there isnt a fallout that all of us are dealing with
8897529 the people running banks here in new hampshire went through that process thats probably a good part of the reason they didnt get involved in those subprime loans
8897530 we have no concerns for the continued viability of any state chartered banks

8897542 todays youths are not interested in taking up indigenous crafts after getting education they want to get employed in the government and private companies thus there is a huge dearth of skilled artisans
8897543 if i stop working who will take care of my unit where i have very few employees i am trying to motivate young boys and girls of my village barheta in bihar to take up my art
8897544 they feel that after completing college education they should have a proper job they dont want to struggle like their parents but we are motivating youngsters of the country to take up various indigenous crafts to earn their livelihood and simultaneously save various crafts from dying
8897545 villages are the cradles of indian crafts so we are trying hard to empower artisans to use their inherent skills as a means of earning their livelihood it is sad that in spite of our rich legacy several craftsmen in the country are having to fight hard against poverty
8897546 diminished the image of judiciary in the eyes of the common person
8897547 the cash for judge scam has definitely diminished the image of judiciary in the eyes of common person in any country there are two options if the government is strong then the judiciary is weak or if the government is weak then the judiciary is strong in india the latter condition is prevailing for the last many years
8897548 we do not know what is going on in the judges lobby there is a well knit nexus of the judges lawyers and people from other occupations they are answerable to nobody and many of their unscrupulous activities go unchecked
8897549 the appointments of all judges should be made public like it is in various other countries they should disclose whose names are under consideration and what parameters were followed for the selection there should be an autonomous judicial accountability commission involving people that represent all the sections of society
8897550 i have no qualms in saying that this incident has tarnished the image of the judiciary in public life now the public should themselves act wisely and avail the option of right to information rti act to know the facts in this matter
8897551 usually there are supervisory bodies that look into the reasonable functioning of judges and lawyers such cases are rare and we have to make a collective effort to avoid such things in future
8897552 this is a human weakness to accept bribe and can happen anywhere and in any organisation however the thing that such unlawful activity was made public and put on trial is worth appreciation in this case the authorities concerned have acted very fast
8897553 now our judiciary should send a right message by taking a right decision and putting the culprits behind the bars at the earliest it will automatically revive the peoples lost faith in the judiciary
8897554 i am wondering what our government is doing they should immediately call a special session of parliament and impeach the accused party i consider it an utter failure on the part of our government that such a scam involving high profile public authorities happened in our country
8897555 the supreme court of india should provide full autonomy to the cbi to look into the matter but it is only the tip of the iceberg so the supreme court should provide links of all the judges to cbi and tell its officials to check the working of judges and law officers throughout the country only then can we accept any accountability in their working
8897556 our judiciary cannot escape from the public wrath and criticism due to the cash for judge scam this episode will certainly lower the esteem of judiciary to some extent
8897557 the enquiry into this case is on and all of us are expecting a speedy result it is high time for both the judges and the lawyers community to realise their responsibility towards the society

8897577 currently food heated in a microwave loses heat to the cold dish because the dishes are transparent to microwaves

8897579 we strongly recommend restrictions in the use of thiazolidinediones a class of oral drugs and question the rationale for leaving rosiglitazone on the market
8897580 at this time justification for use of thiazolidinediones is very weak to non existent

8897619 i was disappointed with the execution of our attack against worcester and we roughly turned over 14 balls and you cant give away an ocean of possession like that playing a good team like that if you give them that amount of ball eventually they will score
8897620 generally we defended well and their tries were pretty soft they scored from the base of a scrum and should never have scored that try at the start of the second half that was just poor play from us
8897621 chris henry dropped the ball over the line if tomoci nagusa above hits bryn he scores and right at the end tomoci was physically over the line and just had to fall and we would have won the game
8897622 we had three hard quality games and they have shown us where we are weak and what we have got to do
8897623 when we have got our attack going its work a lot better but we are dropping the ball early and wed done that consistently since ive been here but the boys are learning
8897624 its not all solved yet its a long process but in the medium term this is going to be some place to be as this will be a bloody good side
8897625 our new blokes have fitted in brilliantly ed odonoghue is playing great clinton schifcofske showed a great turn of pace the other day queensland ian humphreys has done well so there is competition
8897626 the young guys have done well and that has created competition and those young blokes are not going to be happy with sitting on the bench and they are going to be pushing how we start is really important if we start well the guys get their confidence up
8897627 we want to celebrate the momentum and watch it together it sort of gives you that excitement that youre feeling but all together

8897637 die arbeit im hostel ist einfach perfekt f r jemanden wie mich
8897638 ich lerne portugiesisch und andere sprachen finanziere meinen aufenthalt und meine studien hier habe einen platz zum schlafen und mache nebenbei eine weltreise in gewissem sinne
8897639 jeden tag sagen mir menschen mein gott hast du ein sch nes leben und sie haben recht
8897640 denn die stimmung im hostel ist einfach toll auf reisen ist jeder entspannter toleranter mehr dazu bereit etwas von sich zu geben
8897641 da hatte ich einfach keine zeit mehr f r mich und verga v llig wer ich bin
8897642 die arbeit bereichert mich hier kann ich mehr zu mir selbst finden ich treffe tolle leute lerne sprachen und viel ber die welt
8897643 ich habe diesen job vom ersten bis zum heutigen tag an geliebt
8897644 mein traum ist es irgendwann an einem anderen ort in den ich mich verliebe mein eigenes hostel aufzumachen
8897645 klar ist f r mich ich will weiter im hostel arbeiten ob als angestellte oder besitzerin das wei ich noch nicht
8897646 als schreiberling ist man ja sehr flexibel mit dem n tigen kapital passt da ein hostel in ungarn durchaus in meine pl ne und w re vielleicht auch eine gute inspirationsquelle f r meine romane

8897653 vor dem hintergrund der europaweiten energiepreissteigerungen und der schw chelnden konjunktur in deutschland ist dieses ergebnis f r die deutsche caravaningbranche sehr erfreulich

8897655 starkes signal f r die entwicklung und den gro technischen einsatz der ccs technologie in deutschland
8897656 die entscheidung von rwe ist ein starkes signal f r die entwicklung und den gro technischen einsatz der ccs technologie in deutschland mit dem 450 mw kraftwerk dem geplanten bau einer pipeline und der erkundung potenzieller speicherorte in schleswig holstein wird die gesamte ccs prozesskette realisiert rwe dokumentiert durch diese investitionsentscheidung seine entschlossenheit diese klimaschutztechnologie in deutschland voranzutreiben und daf r das unternehmerische risiko zu tragen
8897657 die heutige mitteilung von rwe und die inbetriebnahme der oxyfuel anlage von vattenfall in spremberg am 9 september zeigen dass die verwirklichung der ccs technologie in deutschland fahrt aufnimmt
8897658 der in der beratung befindliche rechtsrahmen muss so ausgelegt sein dass die ccs technologie schnell umgesetzt werden kann zum beispiel durch kurze genehmigungsverfahren f r pipelines und speicher denn nur durch einen z gigen einsatz wird die ccs technologie einen beitrag f r die erreichung der ehrgeizigen klimaziele in deutschland und europa leisten k nnen hier ist die politik gefordert entsprechend verl ssliche rahmenbedingungen zu schaffen und dieser innovativen klimaschutztechnologie zum durchbruch zu verhelfen
8897659 wir wissen dass die akzeptanz f r ccs nicht von selbst kommt aber die argumente f r diese technologie sind berzeugend wir freuen uns dass mit konkreten projekten jetzt der beweis angetreten werden kann dass die ccs prozesskette funktioniert und einen entscheidenden beitrag im kampf gegen den klimawandel leisten kann

8897664 in the face of good growth and loose fiscal policy i dont expect any relaxation in the central banks tight policy stance even though inflation has moderated slightly
8897665 this year also growth will be close to 8 percent and close to 8 percent growth is not something to be scoffed at
8897666 consumption spending is going to get a boost from an expansionary fiscal policy in the second half of the year
8897667 the prolonged slowdown in manufacturing does now finally look to be spreading to services with financial services growth showing the biggest decline from 10 5 percent to 9 3 percent

8897677 i think what really matters to us is that the game doesnt become more and more intimidating for new players to take on
8897678 we feel like that if we were to constantly increase the level cap and never go back and address the total time it takes to get from the beginning to the end then we would see the game become a bigger obstacle for new players to start up and play with their friends
8897679 i think a lot of our player base actively creates new characters so these kinds of changes benefit those players also
8897680 i think theyre looking at doing a one off initially and theyre basically able to utilise the assets because our team has brought lego characters to life
8897681 my understanding is that they will use the engine the maya files where the characters come to life but theyll be creating animated i think its a 20 minute cartoon
8897682 im personally quite intrigued to see how it comes out lego every time theyve had a new brand out theyve done some cgi stuff as well but i think this will be quite different
8897683 with the high price of metals on world commodity markets metal and cable theft has become a significant problem for the rail industry utilities and telecommunications providers

8897697 if present at all was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
8897698 while such a reduction in all cause mortality would have been impressive these mortality benefits are likely implausible previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated a healthy user benefit or frailty bias
8897699 over the last two decades in the united sates even while vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality further only about 10 percent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 percent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion
8897700 the healthy user effect is seen in what doctors often refer to as their good patients patients who are well informed about their health who exercise regularly do not smoke or have quit drink only in moderation watch what they eat come in regularly for health maintenance visits and disease screenings take their medications exactly as prescribed and quite religiously get vaccinated each year so as to stay healthy such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
8897701 but you also need to take care of yourself everyone can reduce their risk by taking simple precautions
8897702 wash your hands avoid sick kids and hospitals during flu season consider antiviral agents for prophylaxis and tell your doctor as soon as you feel unwell because there is still a chance to decrease symptoms and prevent hospitalization if you get sick because flu vaccine is not as effective as people have been thinking it is

8897709 chef o is a great addition to the aakp convention
8897710 kidney patients always ask questions about nutrition and diet and chef o can help take some of the mystery out of kidney friendly nutrition

8897714 the dramatic clinical results from this study of gleevec in the adjuvant gist setting are especially encouraging when we consider the incremental benefit we typically see with other adjuvant therapies for solid tumors
8897715 the adjuvant use of gleevec if approved would represent an important advance in the ongoing post surgery management of gist
8897716 the number of clinical training positions available for medical students and junior doctors can be increased if governments commit to working with medical education stakeholders to address the shortage
8897717 increasing clinical training capacity will require a significant financial investment which should be tied to the performance benchmarks in the upcoming australian healthcare agreements
8897718 more investment is needed to expand teaching infrastructure develop novel teaching programs such as the prevocational general practice placement program pgppp and adequately remunerate senior doctors who teach their junior colleagues
8897719 in addition we need to expand medical student and junior doctor training opportunities in underutilised settings such as private hospitals general practices and rural areas
8897720 this research found that lymphoma families perceived that treatment experiences as far more arduous than that of other childhood haematological groups such as acute lymphatic leukaemia all
8897721 children diagnosed with all endure several years of treatment whilst the treatment protocol for the lymphoma population in comparatively short lasting about 6 to 9 months
8897722 the stress of treatment is further exacerbated when families have been relocated from rural areas to the metropolitan treatment centre there is simply no time to return home to reconnect with family and to relax in the comfort and privacy of their own home
8897723 in this largely unexplored area of paediatric oncology these findings underscore the need for diagnostic specific support services for patients and their families

8897735 the fda clearance further demonstrates the clinical relevance and benefit of allomap testing in assessing the potential risk of rejection in heart transplant patients
8897736 this clearance and the fdas focus on this field underscore the growing importance of molecular diagnostics in the care of patients
8897737 allomap is a valuable tool in the management of heart transplant patients
8897738 as a simple blood test allomap can be used on an ongoing basis to help to determine which heart transplant patients are the least likely to suffer from rejection which is a key factor in the long term well being and treatment of these patients
8897739 we have worked diligently with the fda on our 510 k application since the agency announced its plans to regulate this new category of molecular diagnostic tests
8897740 fda clearance of allomap testing is a milestone in the emerging field of molecular diagnostics and an affirmation of the xdx approach to develop and commercialize high value molecular tests for immune mediated conditions by integrating genomic technologies clinical expertise and state of the art informatics
8897741 the new york stem cell foundation conference has in just three years become an essential gathering for the top figures in our field solidifying new yorks place as a center for stem cell science
8897742 in addition to directly funding innovative research nyscf is playing a leading role in fostering collaboration between researchers which is essential to the advancement of this work
8897743 we are excited to provide this forum for the very best minds in the world of regenerative medicine to report their latest findings and exchange ideas
8897744 it is equally important to provide a lay audience with a clear understanding of what we are learning from stem cell science and how it is bringing us ever closer to clinical applications their support remains critical in advancing this pathfinding science
8897745 after the success of our virtual launch event we saw an opportunity to use the platform to engage with businesses across the region that may not have the time or inclination to attend traditional conferences or networking events
8897746 by providing a virtual space and structure for events of this type we believe we can extend our reach whilst providing businesses with access to information that would otherwise be difficult to obtain

8897749 presgar was really our first big account in terms of establishing our solution as ideal for a distributed outpatient imaging center group
8897750 the relationship has allowed us to prove that our solution is superior to anything else in that kind of environment
8897751 what weve done is make digital mammography function similarly to all of the other modalities offered by presgar
8897752 that has eliminated the need for them to make a separate costly investment in mammography no longer does a company such as presgar need to have one solution for all of the modalities and a separate solution for mammography
8897753 digital mammography combined with ramsoft pacs has saved us tens of thousands of dollars beyond the workstation savings and thats a big deal
8897754 imaging centers face a very tough climate these days and we have to do what we can to be efficient and profitable ramsoft pacs and its gateway routers have gone a long way toward helping us achieve that

8897768 these are all strong indications that t costata may be the earliest example of marine overexploitation
8897769 our discovery that t costata was already on a trajectory of decline prior to this period corroborates this hypothesis by providing the first circumstantial evidence that humans were not only using but also depleting reef resources making t costata the likely earliest victim of anthropogenic degradation of coral reefs
8897770 declining marine and terrestrial resources by human and climatic factors respectively may have acted in concert to thwart the precocious but short lived colonization of the near east by anatomically modern but technologically primitive humans at the end of the last interglacial
8897771 proving that we can directly measure amyloid beta in the human brain is an important step forward for both clinical and basic research and that may be true not just in alzheimer s disease but also in other serious neurological disorders
8897772 the results have potentially important clinical implications because the measurement of amyloid beta in the human brain may turn out to be a good indicator of how well brain cells are communicating with each other even in very sick patients
8897773 if the results are validated in further studies this may assist physicians in making important patient management decisions in patients with acute neurological disorders
8897774 whether its protecting gorillas in the republic of congo or monkeys and gibbons in cambodia conservation can and does work when you have government commitment and scientific knowledge on the ground
8897775 now we must put into place the management to truly protect these populations and apply the approach to other regions where primates are in trouble
8897776 despite this good news in cambodia the area still remains at risk from conversion to agro industrial plantations for crops including biofuels and commercial mining
8897777 i liked the way we started the game we got control immediately and left very little doubt about the control of the game we talked to our football team about how eastern kentucky has a lot of tradition theyve won a lot of football games we didnt want to give them a lot of confidence early on we had to exert ourselves early on when you win as much as they do if you give them a spark and you give them an opportunity theyre going to fight you they fought us but we got a foothold early on controlled the football offensively got some points and defensively really limited their ability to push the ball down the field
8897778 weve got some great great receivers and great running backs and my line protected for me even though we did well we still have a lot of room to improve
8897779 grutza was the quarterback my freshman and sophomore years so theres really no difference with grutza being in there
8897780 were still comfortable with grutza out there we showed out there we didnt miss a step
8897781 its a real concern you saw our second group out there made up mostly of redshirt and true freshmen its not a good situation we cant afford to get another guy injured it gets desperate
8897782 it was unbelievable to be out there i was so nervous when i first went out there they called the first few plays and i was still kind of giddy its really different than practice against our defense you cant cut our defense is so good at swarming the ball our offensive line was cutting the defenders and the holes are there and i was just making cuts it was easy for me
8897783 im just happy they scored or i would have been angry
8897784 special teams stunk it was terrible very disappointing i really felt like with the amount of time i spent on special teams i was disappointed in our play awful special teams
8897785 that play is pretty nasty that they ran two times in a row to get in the end zone they ran a zone read and the quarterback pulled the ball and instead of running it or going with the option which most teams do and they had been doing the wide receiver ran a slant well probably do it next week

8897795 when we were deciding on program elements for demofall 08 we really wanted to take it up a level and get the pundits really discussing topics that were truly relevant to the audience
8897796 we also wanted to give everyone a chance to see their favorite journalists go head to head and maybe have an argument or two as they discuss their opinions and where the future of tech is going most importantly we wanted them to be fun and i think we have achieved our goals
8897797 we pressured their backcourt that resulted to them having a difficult time bringing down the ball
8897798 and when they did break our press they had little time to execute their half court play
8897799 maybe they were surprised because we used it the whole game
8897800 we asked permission and we were given one maybe we got more lucky with it

8897842 smoking during pregnancy is a double edged sword with respect to sids
8897843 not only does it raise a mothers likelihood of having a preterm baby who is already among the most vulnerable to sids but it increases the infants susceptibility to sids even further
8897844 preterm babies are known to have increased breathing difficulties in proportion to their prematurity and cigarette smoke is known to increase apneas in full term babies
8897845 but until now cigarette smoke exposure and preterm birth have not been investigated together with respect to their potential effects on respiratory dysfunction
8897846 our study shows that preterm infants make incomplete and or delayed recovery from interruptions in breathing
8897847 this has clear implications for their risk of sids but there is even still another reason for concern even after the risk of sids has passed inability or delayed recovery from repeated low oxygen episodes can also be detrimental to brain development there is increasing evidence that infants exposed to prenatal cigarette smoke are at high risk for developmental and behavioral disorders
8897848 to our knowledge this is the first report of a direct association between childhood abuse and asthma and asthma related outcomes
8897849 we wanted to explore whether exposure to stress and violence is associated with an increased risk of asthma in urban children living in puerto rico
8897850 we already know that there is a high prevalence of asthma in puerto rican children and many studies have linked stress and exposure to violence to health problems in childhood including asthma
8897851 children with a history of abuse had higher frequencies of all outcomes of interest than those without a history of abuse
8897852 after adjusting for relevant covariates history of abuse was associated with an approximate doubling of the odds of current asthma healthcare use for asthma and allergic rhinitis
8897853 it is not simply the exposure to a particular stressor but the physiological response to that stressor that predicts physical health outcomes
8897854 latino culture places an emphasis on certain values and social supports that may buffer the effects of poverty and community violence experienced by children in puerto rico
8897855 we were disappointed not to find a smoking gun that would explain the common association between obesity and asthma
8897856 however this research points us to other possibilities that future research should examine
8897857 we hypothesized that the low grade systemic inflammation present in obesity would augment the inflammation of asthma a synergistic effect
8897858 or alternatively that the inflammation of obesity might affect the airways independently an additive effect perhaps resulting in mixed airway inflammation
8897859 what we found was that although inflammatory cells and other biomarkers of inflammation were increased there was no significant interaction demonstrated between obesity and asthma
8897860 this does not change the fact that there is a well established link between asthma and obesity sometimes a negative result is important and the results add to our body of knowledge regarding the obesity asthma link now we need to look in other directions for the answers
8897861 we did not look at this in our patients given that asthma is immunologically driven this is a potential avenue for further research
8897862 alternatively it may be that dynamic changes in lung function that occur with episodes of asthma are different with excess body weight
8897863 its probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their child words baby and daddy in english papa in italian and tata grandpa in hungarian for example
8897864 the language centre of most right handed adults is located on the left side of the brain this is consistent with our finding with new born babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently
8897865 we were disappointed not to find a smoking gun that would explain the common association between obesity and asthma
8897866 however this research points us to other possibilities that future research should examine
8897867 we hypothesized that the low grade systemic inflammation present in obesity would augment the inflammation of asthma a synergistic effect
8897868 or alternatively that the inflammation of obesity might affect the airways independently an additive effect perhaps resulting in mixed airway inflammation
8897869 what we found was that although inflammatory cells and other biomarkers of inflammation were increased there was no significant interaction demonstrated between obesity and asthma
8897870 this does not change the fact that there is a well established link between asthma and obesity sometimes a negative result is important and the results add to our body of knowledge regarding the obesity asthma link now we need to look in other directions for the answers
8897871 we did not look at this in our patients given that asthma is immunologically driven this is a potential avenue for further research
8897872 alternatively it may be that dynamic changes in lung function that occur with episodes of asthma are different with excess body weight
8897873 the brains ability to reorganize itself is much greater than previously believed in our studies in which a group of sighted study subjects were blindfolded for five days we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight the speed and dynamic nature of the changes we observed suggest that rather than establishing new nerve connections which would take a long time the visual cortex is unveiling abilities that are normally concealed when sight is intact
8897874 we recruited 47 subjects to participate in the study half of the study participants remained completely blindfolded 24 hours a day for a total of five days under the careful watch of the staff of bidmcs general clinical research center the other half were only blindfolded for testing but spent the rest of the day seeing normally during their stays both sets of study participants underwent intensive braille instruction for four to six hours a day from a professional instructor from the carroll center for the blind
8897875 this extremely rapid adaptation indicates that functions that are normally inhibited in the brains visual cortex will come to the surface when they are needed we believe that over time if these adaptive functions are sustained and reinforced they will eventually lead to permanent structural changes
8897876 our brain captures different types of information from the world sounds sights smells or tactile sensations the impressions we form require us to merge these various different elements but sciences traditional view of brain function is that it is organized in separate and highly specialized systems
8897877 smoking during pregnancy is a double edged sword with respect to sids
8897878 not only does it raise a mothers likelihood of having a preterm baby who is already among the most vulnerable to sids but it increases the infants susceptibility to sids even further

8897883 we need a whole new approach and we need to act now our research shows that many of the worlds existing no take areas are in the wrong place
8897884 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8897885 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8897886 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful

8897894 we have seen a small improvement in consumer confidence in august but this should not be seen as a turnaround in core sentiment

8897916 while we make a huge noise about zimbabwe and the mugabe regime on the other hand we are moving further down the path of integrating our economy with dictatorships closer to home like myanmar burma
8897917 the difference seems to be its ok when there is money in it for us the generals in burma will be laughing all the way to the bank
8897918 if you disagree with the government in myanmar burma you get shot that must assist employment relations with the myanmar burma working class no end no negotiations no strikes and the ultimate flexible labour force

8897938 this means relief for poor consumers residing in urban areas relying mainly on staple foods such as maize meal
8897939 given that maize meal is considered a staple food for the poor and the fact that most of the poor in south africa live in rural areas this trend should be of concern and needs to be investigated further
8897940 the reasons are that wheat product prices lag wheat prices and hence higher wheat prices earlier this year are only reflected now
8897941 notable drops in prices of maize wheat and rice were seen over recent months the same applies to dairy products
8897942 these trends should bring some relief for the poorest of the poor

8897954 we believe that the milk exchange will enable both milk producers and buyers to establish contracts at the best possible price in order to help create a more efficient market environment
8897955 the trade platform will enable producers to make their product available to the entire south africa while at the same time selling their milk to the highest bidder
8897956 it also gives milk buyers an opportunity to obtain milk from more producers at national level
8897957 these regional trends do not necessarily reflect the national picture the milk exchange provides an opportunity to reduce friction in the value chain
8897958 in reaction to this production will also rise and the market reaches equilibrium this can only happen when market signals flow freely through the system

8897999 overheidsbedrijven zoals belgacom zouden beter geprivatiseerd worden de rol van de overheid is in de eerste plaats de voorwaarden cre ren voor een competitieve goedwerkende markt het is niet aan de overheid om zelf een marktspeler te zijn met in dit geval een quasi monopoliepositie er bovenop
8898000 de overheid moet zorgen dat de consument profiteert van scherpe concurrentie dit is vandaag nog altijd niet het geval belgacom schermt de markt af

8898013 your competitor is only a click away and weve seen over the last four years that retailers have become very aggressive with shipping prices and used it as one of their most productive promotions i dont know that it will necessarily start a price war because its already extremely competitive
8898014 theres free shipping that a lot of retailers offer offers free shipping with a minimum 25 order
8898015 during the holiday season last year eight to 10 retailers were offering free shipping with no conditions or a minimum order size
8898016 free shipping or significantly discounted shipping costs the retailer money
8898017 im sure from a consumer perspective they still think gas is a major expense and theyre trying to reduce it any way they can
8898018 thats one of the reasons that the down economy has the effect of pushing people to shop online more than they did in the past
8898019 a lot of consumers tell us that one of the things that keeps them from making online purchases is fear of getting a big bill for shipping
8898020 we fixed the shipping price to eliminate that concern a price war is not our intent we spend our time making sure we have a good value equation for our customers we dont know how our competition will react
8898021 well make it up hopefully when customers come back to redtag com to buy more items thats why were willing to go low on the shipping because we want to earn the customers long term loyalty
8898022 redtag is smaller but its got some good relationships in place
8898023 you come to read and take great for families its a great thing to see families spending time together we want you to have as much fun as were having up here

8898025 its some of the purest water in the united states
8898026 but if youre looking for snooty you wont find it here
8898027 it represents a period of time in our history when the country was faced with pretty dire economic times

8898038 mr chan is not a typical criminal and this is not a typical crime
8898039 i just wanted to kind of be rid of it
8898040 so this was the choice i made and it was a tough one
8898041 after looking at all the treatment plans the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
8898042 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing
8898043 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
8898044 my daughters wont have to watch me struggle like my sisters children watched her struggle
8898045 it has allowed me to spend my time worrying about kid stuff instead of that other stuff that is a great luxury
8898046 yeah im going to face challenges but you cant get any darker than where ive been
8898047 we would never claim that what we study in mice directly relates to how antidepressants work in humans but there are interesting features in parallel
8898048 the study unifies different observations that point to the brains dentate gyrus region and to creation of nerve cells as being important in depression
8898049 at least in mice this result directly links antidepressants and voluntary exercise with trkb mediated creation of nerve cells
8898050 we can get biochemical physiological behavioral and anatomical results in animal models
8898051 these all resonate with the human condition so perhaps you have a physiological relevancy
8898052 there could be a way to stimulate growth of nerve cells to fight depression for example
8898053 among the items taken were two cans of lager and a bottle of frosty jack cider
8898054 the next offence happened in february of this year at york when ingram visited and stole from seven stores including marks and spencer bhs a zavvi music store and hmv
8898055 security guards at hmv became suspicious and stopped him as he left
8898056 they found him to be carrying stolen goods from the other shops including champagne mp3 players and bottles of spirits
8898057 the goods had an estimated value of just under 500 and ingram admitted straight away he had taken the items
8898058 security staff saw him take two bottles of spirits off the shelf and hide these in a bag he was carrying
8898059 mr ingram spent 21 years serving the community and has had an awesome fall from grace
8898060 he has resigned from the police force and is now living on benefits
8898061 when he was first diagnosed with his mental illness he thought it was unmanly and didnt take his medication and took drink instead
8898062 he now realises he must take his medication and not drink in order to keep his condition stable and stop him doing bizarre things in future
8898063 you have this mental illness but that is not an excuse to go stealing from shops
8898064 what is particularly gratifying about this extra investment is that it has been influenced by members of the public who told us the sort of services they wanted during our healthier future consultation last year
8898065 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
8898066 if this turns out to be a non event the market could really come roaring back down
8898067 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production
8898068 but everything is up in the air until monday or tuesday
8898069 the suspicion would arise that someone in the united states created this conflict on purpose to stir up the situation and to create an advantage for one of the candidates in the competitive race for the presidency in the united states they needed a small victorious war
8898070 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8898071 if i look at the situation in the second quarter we would have to say it was more self inflicted
8898072 whenever youre restarting growth what i can tell you is its an imprecise process there were some parts of the business where we were probably too aggressive

8898076 a segment of society thinks that religion is given a great weight in an emerging new cultural identity and lifestyle and is worried about this development

8898079 i am thinking about buying an iphone but i have been hearing reports about its unreliability should i be worried should i wait for the problems to be fixed before i purchase an iphone should i not get an iphone at all
8898080 i like the iphone for its touch screen interface and for the fact that i can combine my ipod and my mobile phone into one device i even like that i can use an app like maps occasionally but thats it mainly i want a mobile phone that i can depend on for making and receiving calls without having to jump through hoops or read hundreds of pages of documentation

8898113 he slapped at rival john mccain even as he called for an end to washingtons partisan politics including appeals for common ground on contentious issues abortion gay rights gun control and immigration and he addressed nearly every major criticism of himself and his campaign head on
8898114 i dont believe that sen mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans
8898115 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8898116 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8898117 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead
8898118 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief
8898119 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8898120 i felt like i wanted to cry i felt like it was about the people he hit it out of the park
8898121 but he talked about substance hes thinking of our future and talking about all the right things thats what people need to hear
8898122 a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain sen obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8898123 we specifically this semester are interested in bringing someone with a political background because of the proximity to the election
8898124 we had hoped to bring someone that had some knowledge and some excitement factor in the political arena and john edwards obviously fit that description at the time
8898125 were in a time in our economy when the financial markets are tougher

8898140 when the company said they had not made the booking the hotel immediately alerted all 30 hotels on the new security network system which is now running in edinburghs city centre
8898141 so when khullar tried to use the same scam on the radisson they called us and we told them to let him check in until we had done some checks on him before we then went round and arrested him for fraud
8898142 this is the first example of the system working which is very good news

8898150 my father just literally died in my arms i notified all my kids
8898151 i thought it was heartfelt i thought it was what america needed
8898152 he touched every base and every issue he addressed the country and he made everyone feel as though hell be the next president of the united states and it was just heartfelt and im glad he did it
8898153 yeah i mean i think thats what mccain is going to do next week when he has the republican convention so i think he did it in all fairness
8898154 i think obamas speech made americans especially black americans extremely proud
8898155 i feel that his speech just continues what martin luther king jr s i have a dream speech embodied

8898229 il dibattito sulle future alleanze in vista delle amministrative del 2009 mi pare eccessivamente geometrico e molto poco politico le ultime elezioni hanno dimostrato lincapacit del pd di attrarre consensi al centro e si sa nelle contemporanee societ complesse un partito che non sappia interpretare i bisogni e le aspirazioni anche dei ceti medi produttivi spinge questi ultimi nelle braccia della destra colbertiana tatcheriana o nazionalista che sia ed destinato a perdere ecco perch ogni nostalgia per lunione semplicemente suicida questo limite della sinistra e quindi anche del pd non si supera nel contingente alleandosi con ludc anzi unalleanza fin dal primo turno con ludc potrebbe allontanare dal pd pezzi dellelettorato di sinistra o spingere ampie fasce di elettori udc nelle braccia di berlusconi e innanzitutto il pd che deve saper offrire programmi affidabili e uomini credibili anche per lelettorato moderato il saper interpretare queste esigenze senza perdere il consenso tra i ceti popolari tra i giovani tra gli intellettuali che sono lelettorato naturale di una forza riformista la grande scommessa di un pd davvero plurale che non voglia chiudersi solo nella storia della tradizione socialista della sinistra italiana per questo il pd non deve commettere lerrore di voler chiudere ovunque la partita del confronto elettorale amministrativo della primavera prossima al primo turno deve invece sfruttare tutte le potenzialit del doppio turno per ampliare le alleanze nei ballottaggi ma solo dopo aver misurato la propria vera forza e avere chiaramente indicato i contenuti programmatici della propria proposta di governo

8898476 there are ten million homes in this country that still lack basic insulation making these properties more energy efficient would take around 2 billion off fuel bills each and every year
8898477 one off payments to deal with rising energy bills will be of help to many households but will do little to tackle the root causes of fuel poverty a national home insulation programme would be the best long term solution to this challenge and that of cutting carbon emissions
8898478 energy suppliers are making eye watering profits at the expense of hard working families the government should seize the opportunity to take a long term solution to current problems by using these disproportionate excesses to pay for a massive drive to insulate peoples homes

8898557 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
8898558 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
8898559 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear

8898602 this application has raised a lot of concerns due to the iconic location on peebles high street
8898603 but we have to face the facts that we have an offer here where there is an even split between retail and a restaurant on these terms i am happy to support the application
8898604 to refuse will impact the viability of the high street while accepting the application will enhance it
8898605 i am sure the council realize quickly enough that there is a desperate need for a bus park
8898606 all i was trying to do was to return some of the infrastructure to the town that the councillors threw away when they allowed flats to be built on the old bus depot
8898607 it is clear that peebles would benefit from the provision of a purpose built bus park for service school and tour buses
8898608 the increase in the number of buses parking in car parks reduces the number of spaces available for domestic vehicles in what is already a very congested town centre
8898609 however it is felt that this application site is not the most appropriate location for this type of development due to the exposed nature of the site and unacceptable access arrangements
8898610 we need to find somewhere closer to or within the town
8898611 i have had a fruitful meeting with derek nimmel a publican from edinburgh who has expressed a keen interest in taking over the lease on the premises
8898612 we have both agreed that the hotel needs to be re opening sooner rather than later and i would hope that this can happen in the coming weeks
8898613 i would also like to allay fears and rumours that have been circulating the village that i have no plans to turn the premises into flats or any other development theres a lot of scaremongering going on and its just not true
8898614 i met with mr swift on monday afternoon and he was very helpful and co operative
8898615 excessive speed continues to be a challenge for roads policing officers and unfortunately is nearly always a contributory factor in serious and fatal road traffic collisions
8898616 drivers who continue to travel in excess of recognized speed limits will be proactively targeted through the latest available technology and will invariably lose their licenses
8898617 there are concerns about the speeds being reached and cameras is an option being considered
8898618 it is at crisis level and i am urging both scottish borders council and transport scotland to bring in average speed cameras
8898619 i think they would be extremely effective and justified as this road is dangerous enough without the speeds we are now witnessing
8898620 average speed cameras are much more effective as they cut speeds for the entire length of a stretch of road not just in single locations
8898621 there is obviously cause for concern on the a702 and we do constantly monitor situations with our partners lothian and borders police
8898622 were extremely excited about this especially when you consider that the chambers institution where it once stood celebrates its 150th anniversary next year
8898623 we would hope to include it in the variety of celebrations we have planned
8898624 the institution is intended for the use of the people of the shire and perhaps this might draw the public back towards it it would help to revitalise the institution as it too is a part of local history
8898625 putting it in the quadrangle would be a nice touch its a big part of peebles history and it needs to be conserved for the good of the town im especially glad to have had a hand in it
8898626 if we hadnt retrieved the tablets then who knows how long theyd have lain there
8898627 i believed we were allowed to enter the land these sheep required attention
8898628 it was clear to me that they did not have an adequate knowledge of the various powers of when a warrant was required and of the circumstances in which they could act without one
8898629 the steps they took were accordingly contrary to the law and the evidence gathered was irregularly recovered
8898630 our office will liaise closely with the scottish society for the protection of cruelty to animals to see how the legislation should be interpreted
8898631 this is a bit of a test case in many ways we accept the sheriffs ruling and wont be appealing his decision
8898632 one of the main premises of the animal health and welfare scotland act 2006 was to make the legislation more straightforward therefore enabling reporting agencies to bring animal cruelty cases to court more swiftly this fundamental principle would now appear to be at risk
8898633 the defence lawyer placed great emphasis on the fact that he believed our inspectors could have obtained a warrant within the hour in our most recent experience it took four days for a warrant to be granted
8898634 the incident occurred shortly after the new animal welfare legislation became law in scotland our inspectors interpretation of the act had already been discussed with the crown office and the society was of the opinion that a warrant was not needed to gather evidence in this instance
8898635 our officers are very concerned that so many animals suffered and died or were in such a poor state they needed to be humanely destroyed on site by the ministry vet we asked to attend
8898636 the scottish spca now expects the crown office to advise us on what has changed in our interpretation of the act as we still maintain our officers acted correctly
8898637 given the level of suffering the lack of daylight at that time of year and the risk of evidence being lost due to bad weather conditions and scavenging we still believe the correct actions were taken
8898638 ive lived here for over 42 years and this is the worst ive ever seen it the water has been right up to my front door to be honest im sick of complaining
8898639 myself and all the other elderly residents around here can never use that path to get to the bus stop its treacherous
8898640 i work at baguette express in galashiels and use the path every day when it rains my garden gets flooded and then in winter the track is frozen with ice and snow
8898641 someone will have to break their neck up there before anything gets done about it
8898642 we have to climb up a mud track to get the bus and once any rain comes it just turns into a burn it floods the front garden and then after that youre tracking mud into the house for weeks
8898643 all the elderly residents around here have to walk the length of the avenue to get the bus this adds almost 10 15 mins to their journey its not a path up there but a riverbed
8898644 a menudo escuchamos o leemos que en am rica latina avanza una nueva izquierda y sin embargo vemos que nada cambia que los modelos econ mico sociales impuestos en la poca de las dictaduras siguen en pie y que las empresas transnacionales contin an haciendo

8898648 it wasnt a conscious thing but they had such low career expectations of themselves when we graduated from high school those who actually did that they couldnt imagine big things for me i wanted to go to college and they thought that i was crazy our kind just didnt do that at the time we were expected to hang out on the streets get in fights and let life happen to us many of them ended up dead at a young age or in prison
8898649 and there were two ways to do it one is to stay on the shore and fish for whatever happens to come your way and the other is to get on a boat go out to the choppy waters and fish for the big ones the marlins the way i figure it is that i was gonna go for the marlins i might get some and i might not if i didnt i could always go back my friends would still be there waiting for me standing on the shore
8898650 go for the marlins in my case give up the safe job and move on take a calculated risk dont let negative people or negative thoughts dictate your life

8898760 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio
8898761 es un conflicto que el estado le ha instalado a la comunidad paichil antriao
8898762 el estado ha ido de alg n modo violentando permanentemente el derecho a la consulta y participaci n de la comunidad
8898763 el conflicto no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
8898764 el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
8898765 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui

8898768 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia

8898774 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
8898775 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8898776 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido

8898911 weve done a lot of work to comply with the requirements of the town and take environmental and land constraints into account
8898912 were trying to address all the concerns from the deis
8898913 theyre behind me so they shouldnt bother me but ill probably see the tops of three
8898914 i found it very interesting that nobody could tell me what the noise level is from the turbine thats a major concern of a lot of the citizens here
8898915 i think theres a lot of misconceptions out there about wind power
8898916 its just like i plant more corn than i need knowing im not going to harvest all of it because you lose some
8898917 we have had development applications lodged with us before for wind farms but theyve had to go through various processes to do with the environment and this providing it receives development approval would be i think the first within the district council of grant
8898918 i am writing to you to express my shock on reading your nsdc officers report recommending its approval
8898919 in the 11 years i have been an mp i have never known an issue which has engendered so much hostility
8898920 i understand officers have to take note of central government policy councillors though are free to take a different view based on the interests of local residents
8898921 you are the leaders of this community and this is a real opportunity to show strong commitment to those you represent
8898922 there is no benefit to the people of north shropshire the only beneficiary of this wind farm is to the developer who gains very handsomely indeed but at a terrible cost to my constituents
8898923 we shall be very peaceful but we plan to have as many people there as possible
8898924 the kaliakra wind power generation and sales project has been planned as a japanese bulgarian joint implementation project to reduce greenhouse gases sanctioned under the kyoto protocol framework
8898925 is emblematic of how innovations and investment are used to mask criminal encroachment on bio diversity
8898926 the developers tegni cymru have said that a specific planning policy gives them the right to build the wind farm
8898927 this application doesnt come anywhere near meeting that requirement the whole purpose of defining green belt land is to create an area that is protected from development
8898928 the generators will be a massive blot on the landscape and will be visible from miles around imagine an olympic swimming pool stood on its end put another one on top then another half and add the giant blades
8898929 the amount of energy that they will create will be minuscule and in no way justifies the destruction of the green belt it will spoil the area
8898930 regional parks should be protected developed and enjoyed by both visitors and residents
8898931 the countryside of cheshire is epitomised by this site and is seen by many as the antidote to urbanisation and relief from city life the park is key to the growth of the visitor economy in cheshire that will see tourism worth some 2billion per year by 2015
8898932 as the northeast monsoon is unlikely to improve hydel power generation could be affected
8898933 weve been looking at the opportunity talking to the locals and undertaking wind measurements in the area
8898934 council had a briefing at its last council meeting about this major windfarm proposal and is awaiting the lodgement of a development application early in 2009
8898935 council has supported in principle windfarm energy developments in the past as enhancing the reputation of the south east for green energy and looks forward to receiving the development application
8898936 they will be constructing the roads and the foundations for wind turbines and will be erecting the wind turbines
8898937 they will also construct the electrical collector system the lines that transport the power to the substation
8898938 we are now planning to have the first set of 22 turbines completely erected and online in december 2009
8898939 the first turbine will be going up in june the second set of 22 turbines is targeted to be on line in 2010
8898940 the work is scheduled to be awarded in the middle of october and construction on transmission line will start this fall and continue through winter
8898941 it was very well attended with people having to stand outside
8898942 we were very critical of the plans and there were a lot of questions that they could not answer the developers got absolutely hammered
8898943 we raised concerns about peoples health the noise and the distance that they were from the nearest buildings it is 600 metres from the nearest property which is far too close
8898944 we always aim to be good neighbours throughout the lifetime of our wind farms so consultation with the community is vitally important to us we wrote to 1 300 homes closest to the site this summer and have listened to what local people told us and revised our plans
8898945 now everyone is welcome to come along and take this excellent opportunity to see the plans we will be submitting this autumn
8898946 we must first assess the damage to the habitat and once the clean up is completed will be trying to encourage wild salmon to spawn in the rivers rather than introducing hatchery stocks
8898947 salmon will be coming up the rivers in the next few months and we must try to ensure conditions are right for them to spawn
8898948 we were initially very excited to see that someone else thinks we have something of value above our land
8898949 i think we need to find out how this works
8898950 it would totally change the way the middle of saline county would look
8898951 essentially nyri wants to run the line from point a to point b and its up to the psc to determine where it will be built
8898952 turning point all nyri is asking is for the project to be considered fairly
8898953 in a way we should be thankful the company is so inept it couldnt even produce a completed application for more than two years
8898954 this has given us time to plan and now we want to have as many people as possible come to the hearings
8898955 but thats a false connection most of the wind farms would not be on the path of this line and dont require anything like this massive project
8898956 we cannot allow this proposal to become reality and destroy our property our neighborhoods and our quality of life because new york city has been negligent in its power generating decisions
8898957 as our communitys congressman i will not sit back and watch nyri trample on the rights of property owners and misuse eminent domain
8898958 if we really pushed hard to do this the earliest we could do it would be by the end of october
8898959 ive been asking for legal representation for the town for six months so we could be doing our due diligence
8898960 we have local knowledge local input and are quite capable of handling something like this
8898961 we have worked on other projects of this nature such as the ngc pipeline which had five different councils involved
8898962 the decision to call in the hauauru ma raki wind farm consent application recognises the national significance of the project and the important contribution it can make to a secure renewable electricity supply for new zealand
8898963 ralph just polled 8 percent in new mexico it is just remarkable
8898964 were scheduled to be on 45 state ballots by september 12 and were ready to rumble
8898965 we are extremely keen to hear peoples thoughts on our revised plans for the cheverton down wind cluster
8898966 the islands views and opinions on our proposals will be invaluable to us in preparing a planning application for consideration by the isle of wight council
8898967 i was approached at my surgery by several residents who were concerned about what a wind farm could mean for the area
8898968 made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
8898969 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8898970 and today as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration
8898971 even after we learned that iraq has a 79 billion surplus while were wallowing in deficits
8898972 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8898973 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taleban in afghanistan
8898974 there in a grove thick with hemlocks edith danced for him
8898975 what i hope happens is the country doesnt forget the jubilation and excitement thats been generated here
8898976 and i hope it turns into something that changes the world
8898977 i think its the most powerful thing i have ever experienced
8898978 really spoke to me as a woman and i think she spoke to a lot of people in that way
8898979 if you have another gannett paper near by you might have a shared pub a few papers are already putting a pub over more than one paper
8898980 nearest clarksville is nashville where the publisher has her hands filled already the retiring clarksville publisher is 68 three years beyond normal retirement age and kept around to allow gci to figure out what to do i gather he got fed up waiting for a decision after three years the big game plan i once heard involved folding both the leaf chronicle and the murfreesboro daily news journal into the tennessean despite the distances involved think that plan still alive maybe part of the move towards creating statewide newspapers in arizona new jersey and tennessee stay tuned
8898981 putting middle tennessee together a long time gci dream dickson gallatin henderson fairview and ashland already under the tennessean so it would only be a small step to bring in clarksville and murfreesboro the problem is that the tennessean s presses are already contracted out to other publications including nashville scene city paper and the nashville business journal cramming the other publications would be very difficult but would save a huge amount of money since gannett is looking for cost savings ill bet they will go ahead with this plan and work out the difficulties afterwards
8898982 recognising this we think the one step consideration offered by the call in process is an efficient way for the matters to be heard both in time and cost for the community the councils and mighty river power this process still allows local consultation and input
8898983 this letter formally seeks the views as to whether the council has the capacity to process and decide the applications and whether it considers the exercise of any of the powers of intervention would be appropriate
8898984 firstly were going to speak to our rma experts to find out exactly what the ramifications would be
8898985 i would have concerns if this limited in any way the people of palmerston norths ability to have input into the process

8899026 with activity remaining subdued in the first half of 2008 and into 2009 and inflation continuing its decline the case for ecb rate easing will become more forceful

8899031 what the japanese economy needs are not makeshift measures but action to drastically change the economic structure so that japan can survive the rapidly changing circumstances in the global economy

8899044 laurie chaves 20 a student at george brown college said after strolling across with lunchtime crowds that flooded the intersection with up to 100 people at a time some filming the event with cellphone cameras
8899045 youre looking for an elmer the safety elephant to be scolding you from the side its organized chaos
8899046 it is plausible that when police are no longer here that people will cross when the red hand is flashing but that is a concern at every intersection across the city
8899047 at nighttime if theres no police here its a different corner man homeless people drunks i hate to say it but somebodys going to get hurt i hope it works but i think this is a publicity stunt for the city
8899048 its great fun its been done many other places in the world and it works there so there is no reason it shouldnt work here
8899049 our hope is we can get an expert in and take a look at the dogs see if they can be rehabilitated and if so place them in good homes so they dont have to be killed
8899050 the important thing today is that they have a reprieve
8899051 my clients will now work with the spca and if the dogs can be saved they will be its important to remember here that the dogs in the case of michael vick the former nfl star quarterback recently convicted in a dog fighting scheme have all been rehabilitated and are now in good new homes there is no reason the same cant happen with these dogs
8899052 there should be a process to assess the dogs thats what we wanted to see

8899070 tact is the ability to describe others as they see themselves
8899071 one of the neat things they are talking about doing is that after the first pitch first live play or first volleyball play the first dead action will be to hand that ball over to principal mr clark mershon or athletic director mr mark mundell
8899072 then it will be put in a trophy case outside of that this will be an opening game night i dont anticipate fireworks or flyovers by stealth bombers or anything else like that i think it is going to be exciting enough for our folks and players
8899073 they are going to have a level of speed and athleticism that will keep them in the game all the time
8899074 the difference this year is they have 19 starters back this year we think they are going to be one of the top two of three teams we will face this year
8899075 you could see a sense of anxiety yet through the process of playing some you could see us realizing that we could at least compete
8899076 we dont have to be afraid that was an important step to take at the end of that we were competing
8899077 poverty is not the only problem in the north desert encroachment is also basically a northern affair and all stakeholders must adopt a holistic approach toward solving the problems
8899078 the 10 poorest states in nigeria are in the north and it is only in the northern part of the country that you have a poverty level of over 50 per cent of the population
8899079 the facts of our current circumstances in the north are well known to you there is the urgent need for the sultanate to do something about the situation
8899080 our first step is to bring together various stakeholders to understand where we are where we want to be and how we want to get there
8899081 it was an anxiety for some of the kids because they had not been in a big class before
8899082 last time team officials called me up and said were going out to oakland for a week
8899083 so i pack up some clothes and get out to oakland and look on tv and every thing i own is under water
8899084 weve all had time to put together a clear plan as to how it affects the organization the team the families of the team
8899085 i dont want to go into detail as to what we do because what we do is really predicated on when its supposed to arrive
8899086 we will be focused and ready to play the buccaneers
8899087 were planning on that game being at the superdome but the powers that be will have a clear plan in place if that should change any or if our preparation should have to be somewhere else it wont be a distraction we wont allow it to be
8899088 that first game that right there ill never forget that
8899089 even though we didnt make it to the super bowl that year that was my super bowl i never seen anything like that and i was just happy to see people out in the streets just happy to see the saints play that day thats probably one thing ill always remember about new orleans is that day
8899090 there are some areas where it looks like it happened yesterday
8899091 those are houses people used to live in and theyre not living there any more so where are they
8899092 i felt like we were all kind of in this thing together
8899093 im trying to rebuild my career coming off the injury and changing teams kind of a fresh start for me a fresh start for the organization and a fresh start for the city
8899094 the more you talk to people and the more you drive around i think you just feel like life is back
8899095 when the storm happened your mind set had to be were going to make things better than they were before were going to try to turn this into a positive somehow some way i see that happening in a lot of areas so just to kind of be there and just feel like youre kind of a part of the rebuilding process is rewarding
8899096 last year i got to 17 with him and thought that was the best thing id ever done
8899097 he walks over looks me right in the eyes then bends over picks up my marker and hands it to me
8899098 he said either i make this or you win the match
8899099 i played really well as good as i could play
8899100 and he played poorly it was not bob maentz golf it wasnt up to his caliber
8899101 i never really played much match play in tournaments before and thats where most of the nervousness came from i think i got a bunch of it out of the way
8899102 hes always told me to play old man par and play my own game and id do fine
8899103 i was watching him out there he can make mistakes like anyone else
8899104 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time america this is one of those moments

8899106 he said that our economy has made great progress under this president
8899107 i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring
8899108 what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8899109 fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8899110 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain sen obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8899111 finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan
8899112 america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future
8899113 he did everything he needed to do he gracefully dissected john mccain and then set out his own vision and clearly everyone got it
8899114 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8899115 there are regions affected by the storm that our teams have not been able to reach

8899132 we cannot turn back not with so much work to be done
8899133 the opponents of working people are trying to divide us by using obamas race as an issue union members must lead the fight against such divisions and instead look at the bottom line
8899134 i dont think we should be out there pointing fingers in peoples faces and calling them racist instead we need to educate them that if they care about holding onto their jobs their health care their pensions and their homes if they care about creating good jobs with clean energy child care pay equity for women workers theres only going to be one candidate on the ballot this fall whos on our side only one candidate whos going to stand up for our families only one candidate whos earned our votes and his name is barack obama

8899137 that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
8899138 i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8899139 i think this is a close election it is a close election now it will be a close election after the conventions and it will probably be a close election until the end
8899140 because this is an unprecedented situation with two conventions coming one right on top of the other
8899141 john mccain in my view cannot win the presidency without carrying colorado
8899142 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans
8899143 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it

8899161 it is very impressive to me that aryx began focusing on making safer drugs long before the congress and others learned what they know today biotechnology exists to improve peoples lives and the aryx approach uniquely balances efficacy with safety

8899408 it might be a little bit stronger or a little bit weaker depending on how much land it goes over
8899409 it could be a little stronger or a little bit weaker but you still have a powerful hurricane making landfall anywhere from that far tip of the florida panhandle all the way out into southeast texas right around port oconnor the really good hurricane models have this either near mobile ala or new orleans three of them do two others have it closer to southeast texas what the hurricane center is doing on their forecast is kind of splitting the difference

8899416 i remember elvis first as a white artist who imitated blacks and while he inspired us he excited us should i say he was a copy of what we had already seen many times over and there was always this mixed feeling of watching a white carbon copy
8899417 what remains in my mind about elvis presley that is so positive is that he refused to detach himself from sources of his motivation and inspiration and so elvis presley coming from mississippi and memphis with that level of popularity identifying
8899418 elvis presley most black folks resented him because we thought that a black doing the same thing wouldnt get the play

8899426 in 1998 the anc successfully politicised the work of the judicial service commission the body tasked with the appointment of judges its primary goal was shifted away from protecting the integrity of the judiciary towards ensuring the attainment of the ancs political objectives in making appointments or recommendations in the case of the constitutional court the overriding concerns became african leadership demographic representivity and ensuring a politically sympathetic bench

8899432 i knew from visiting my husbands home in malone new york near the canadian border that there was a smuggling culture that had been going on since before prohibition the way it got interesting to me was that i learned people did it by driving across the frozen river
8899433 i developed the story from that one main image i asked myself okay whos in that car what are their lives about what are they smuggling i thought a white woman and a mohawk woman would put an interesting spin it
8899434 it doesnt seem that way when you drive along route 30 you think okay there is nothing here but that is deceptive
8899435 everyone in hollywood just said the same thing over and over you have to recast melissa leo youll never get money with melissa leo my little mantra was if you can suggest to me an actress who can do this role better ill use her but i already knew nobody could do it better
8899436 not only did we shoot it on actual bodies of water that were frozen but melissa did her own driving we had a guy from clarkson university in potsdam n y who would come out and auger and make sure the ice was thick enough
8899437 it really was in the middle of nowhere it was so cold we had to worry about things like the camera freezing up which it did once it was so cold there was one day where the wind chill was about 20 below and we couldnt shoot outside
8899438 in terms of being a woman who makes her own way people help her but nobody really rescues her she rescues herself
8899439 i said to melissa lets look at rio bravo lets look at the searchers because we were talking about how to cary a lead role and how john wayne does it with so little hes not twisting up his face he gives nothing away in terms of expressions and yet everything is there

8899488 there is certainly a growing swell of opinion that change is necessary whether that is going to be within management or a change of composition of company assets is a little unclear at the moment but i think something is going to happen
8899489 the first thing is to clarify their strategy at the moment they could buy almost anything and explain it to the investor community as part of their strategy the second thing would be to introduce hurdle rates of return to increase accountability
8899490 im not that convinced selling nedbank is a good idea if they found a way of redeploying capital to invest in some large global asset management business then maybe the timing is not bad but there are issues about leaving south africa and it would be damaging for the pension funds business
8899491 selling nedbank is not as simple as a lot of international investors make it out to be it would be effectively exiting south africa because the life business would get hammered along with it
8899492 management change is more likely in the next six months than ever before south african portfolio managers are generally passive but in the last month i have come across a lot of them who are begging for change

8899506 with activity remaining subdued in the first half of 2008 and into 2009 and inflation continuing its decline the case for ecb rate easing will become more forceful

8899511 geopolitical storms also threaten to push energy prices higher with the uk media suggesting russia may cut off energy supplies to western europe in response to growing tensions over georgia
8899512 this supports our view that the ecb will eventually cut rates pretty aggressively although worries over the inflation outlook will keep the bank on hold for some months yet

8899523 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
8899524 i was rather disconcerted to see that the arrangements put in place for ramadan which we support for muslim colleagues have been imposed upon all councillors
8899525 we object to the request that non muslim councillors observe the fasting rules for ramadan this sends out the wrong message to our community
8899526 our community consists of a huge number of different religions all of which should be valued and no one religion should be accorded more status or influence than others
8899527 it is requested that members do not partake of any refreshments until after the iftar refreshments are served
8899528 all thats being asked for is courtesy to be shown to the sensitivities around some councillors eating during council meetings whilst others in the room are fasting
8899529 non muslim councillors have simply been asked to ensure that there is iftar food available for muslim councillors because in previous years muslim councillors wanting to break their fast following prayers had found that the iftar packs had been eaten

8899532 if the muslims were offended by the preaching of the anglican evangelist as the reports say the proper procedure was to report their grievances to the police who in our view would have dealt with the issue in accordance with the law
8899533 religious skirmishes and other conflicts pitting members of different denominations should be avoided by all well wishing tanzanians as they could have devastating consequences on the country we should avoid them at all costs

8899583 the people are very warm and passionate when the matches start and the argentinians always seem to play at their best
8899584 i think argentina is favourite for this match we have this new guy juan martin del potro who is very good and who has been called to the team for the davis cup and nalbandian took two tournaments off to prepare for davis cup and for the olympic games juan monaco did the same and the whole team did that so they are really preparing for this match and i think argentina will win pretty easily
8899585 we played only one final in the states and we didnt have too many chances its always nice to play for your country and i have very special memories of that we played some very special matches
