5240001 we will ask the leadership of the russian federation for there to be a russian military base on the territory of south ossetia because russian citizens live here
5240002 we will ask the russian leadership it is their decision
5240003 i consider the government was not working effectively so i signed the decree to sack it
5240004 we have created an emergency commission to liquidate the consequences of the georgian aggression this is connected to the fact that several members of the government are incapable of acting in such a serious military situation
5240005 an international security mission should be deployed to help protect civilians and create a safe environment for the displaced to return home and international organisations should also send fact finding missions to establish the facts report on human rights and urge the authorities to account for any crimes

5240060 yo corr en valencia el fin de semana antes del gp de hungr a en un gt deportivo es una pista dif cil los altos muros de hormig n le dan una imagen muy diferente a un circuito como el de m naco la primera curva es una curva a derecha que se tomar n a tope en un f1 y a continuaci n viene la dif cil frenada de la curva n mero 2 una segunda curva a la derecha la curva 3 es de cuarta despu s de las curvas 5 y 6 los coches llegar n hasta la s ptima marcha antes de la frenada de la curva 8 que es el comienzo de la secci n del puente
5240061 existe una peque a subida en la entrada del puente de astilleros lo que podr a perturbar a los coches en mojado y a continuaci n hay una curva de 90 grados justo antes de volver a la pista y bajar para comenzar un largo curv n los coches m s lentos podr an ser un problema en calificaci n aqu por lo que es necesario mantenerse atento a los comisarios al empezar a subir velocidades
5240062 es realmente dura la frenada de la curva 12 y es ah donde se siente m s como un circuito urbano porque hay sem foros colgando a trav s de la pista y se pueden ver los edificios una doble curva de izquierdas y casi de inmediato la curva 14 un giro de 90 grados a la derecha entonces est s en otra larga recta al final del cual hay una horquilla que no es distinta a la horquilla adelaida en magny cours esta ser una buena oportunidad de adelantamiento

5240075 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

5240077 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5240078 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5240079 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5240080 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5240081 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5240088 inilah gitar kesayangan yang dibeli pada 1978 di singapura pada masa itu harganya sekitar s 2 000 rm4 600 gitar ini sudah dikira mahal untuk remaja berusia 17 tahun iaitu umur saya ketika itu
5240089 sekarang gitar ini boleh mencecah s 16 000 rm36 800
5240090 saya dan gitar bagai menjalin suatu hubungan saya umpama berbual dengan gitar dan tidak boleh hidup tanpa gitar
5240091 jika saya rasa bosan gitarlah menjadi teman sumber insiprasi dan kekuatan saya hiburkan hati dengan gitar kesayangan bagi saya gitar adalah darah daging saya sendiri
5240092 pernah suatu ketika bapa mengupah seorang guru muzik mengajar di rumah selama setahun namun sebenarnya saya bermain gitar mengikut firasat hati minat dan kebolehan ini seolah olah datang sendiri
5240093 mendengar muzik saja saya boleh mengagak dan menghasilkan irama sendiri dengan mengetip tali gitar
5240094 kitalah sendiri yang mencari not lagu sehingga mampu menguasai sesuatu lagu tanpa perlu mengikuti kelas muzik secara formal
5240095 saya tidak pernah bosan dengan gitar tetapi sekarang disebabkan kesibukan lain terutama membabitkan keluarga saya hanya boleh memperuntukkan empat jam setiap hari untuk bersama gitar
5240096 bersama kumpulan search kami sempat bekerjasama menghasilkan sebuah album iaitu cinta buatan malaysia pada 1982 sebelum saya mempelopori kumpulan rock lefthanded setahun kemudian
5240097 kini saya banyak mengadakan persembahan secara solo serta menerima undangan untuk persembahan gitar
5240098 kalau hendak diikutkan irama muzik kita sangat berdaya saing dan seharusnya diterima ramai soal bahasa tidak harus dibangkitkan kerana pencinta muzik menerimanya dengan baik

5240108 we now know that free radicals similar to those in cigarettes are also found in airborne fine particles and potentially can cause many of the same life threatening conditions
5240109 this is a staggering but not unbelievable result when one considers all the diseases in the world that cannot currently be attributed to a specific origin
5240110 we now have evidence that these pfrs are pervasive in the environment and may exist in higher concentrations than most organic pollutants
5240111 the delay in the itc investment tax credit renewal has meant that large commercial jobs are being postponed
5240112 because they dont want to give the democratic congress any credit
5240113 many of these commercial projects are in important planning stages right now and the overall industry is at the tipping point that will lead to widespread adoption
5240114 the absence of the itc will kill most if not all of this growing momentum we need only look to the interruption of tax credits for the wind industry for an example of something that we do not want to repeat this would be a real shame
5240115 over the longer term however the united states commercial market is far too important to be ignored
5240116 a consistent itc policy extending over several years that allows industry to grow and flourish is critical to the industry
5240117 the itc has become a very politicized issue however and its possible that approval could extend into 2009

5240121 andre nel tells me that he has already won 20 off his team mates
5240122 and im hoping that it becomes so addictive that the south africa bowlers do themselves an injury pressing the popper
5240123 we had received information that we would be targeted by groups within azamiyah and within the awakening movement itself
5240124 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5240125 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5240126 i pray the government stops this down sliding and take the country out of this crisis
5240127 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership
5240128 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5240129 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5240130 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5240131 i wouldnt say theres a humanitarian catastrophe but theres an urgent need for primary products
5240132 we have to realize that it isnt just antivirals that we need
5240133 we need to make sure that were prepared to treat people with antibiotics
5240134 many of our federations have asked us to support womens boxing in the olympics we hope well soon have the women competing there
5240135 were looking forward to it the time has been there for a long while we were just waiting but weve been ready long enough
5240136 what we have done i think the ioc family witnessed
5240137 weve made a lot of reform and changes and weve also demonstrated fair judging in the olympics
5240138 win fine lose dont always lose and complain dont accuse the judges and referees they are working very hard if they were not fair every bout the loser would be complaining
5240139 every day every night youre thinking about it scared that something will happen to your family
5240140 i hope when i go home everything will be quiet and there will be peace
5240141 i love my country so i will do anything for my countrys peace
5240142 its too hard to focus on the competition when you have war in your home
5240143 i called them and they said were good dont worry about us but its hard not to worry you cant see you just hear
5240144 but russian military is in georgia walking on the streets people are scared
5240145 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5240146 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5240147 i wouldnt say theres a humanitarian catastrophe but theres an urgent need for primary products
5240148 one way access to enter the school state of the art surveillance cameras and electric locks on doors
5240149 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
5240150 behind the scenes a lot of work has gone on to create out vision for the town centre
5240151 ive been burgled twice in the last eight years ive had my car stolen and i was on my bike the other day and this white van had been following me stopping and starting this was very late at night about midnight i was coming back from some dinner

5240153 most people in taiwan use microsoft software and depend on it for work their market share should be very high
5240154 we fully intend to comply with the process and make sure they get all the information they need
5240155 it was in eighth grade against cabot and i wasnt playing so good
5240156 the next play i sent them 10 12 yards back

5240166 there are a huge number of opportunities whether in hotels restaurants or contract catering all of which can offer exciting fulfilling careers
5240167 this is a young industry its commonplace to find good people in their 20s and 30s running a front of house operation becoming head chefs running divisions for contract caterers or even working as hotel managers
5240168 theres a bright future to be had for well trained motivated recruits we need to communicate our merits more effectively
5240169 we are pleased to deepen this relationship and are confident that this transaction will create long term value for mufg shareholders while creating new opportunities for unionbancal employees and customers
5240170 im confident union banks present and future customers will be delighted with the results
5240171 the continuing massive industrialization in china is providing solid support to the global economy
5240172 merck has analyzed the adverse events reported for gardasil relating to the recent reports of death and paralysis and based on the data available to merck believes that no safety issue related to the vaccine has been identified
5240173 unfortunately we see no signs that the russians are starting to pull out or even preparing to withdraw from georgia
5240174 all of the russian checkpoints towards gori are still there
5240175 they have not retreated one metre from where they were yesterday despite expectations that they would do so
5240176 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behaviour characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century

5240200 i dont think that they would want to hit me on purpose it wouldnt benefit them to hit me
5240201 i dont think he was trying to hit me i think it might have been a little bit of a dirty play they might have been trying to come up and in
5240202 i want him to say hes ready to go maybe id prefer if he didnt have the blurred vision
5240203 if the doctors say he can go he says he can go and davey says he can go he can go

5240270 practical action orientated road map to improve the quality of aid and its impact on development
5240271 when it comes to the challenges of ownership i think that decentralization of ec aid is an important factor decentralization to the delegations so that the dialogue can take place on a level where the partnership is taking place and that goes for all the member states but certainly for the governments and the civil society and that is something for what we have to work stronger for the decentralization of the delegations

5240283 the eleven hundred pieces of silver which were taken from you about which you uttered a curse in my hearing behold the silver is with me i took it
5240284 i wholly dedicate the silver from my hand to the lord for my son to make a graven image and a molten image now therefore i will return them to you
5240285 i am a levite from bethlehem in judah and i am going to stay wherever i may find a place
5240286 dwell with me and be a father and a priest to me and i will give you ten pieces of silver a year a suit of clothes and your maintenance
5240287 now i know that the lord will prosper me seeing i have a levite as priest
5240288 i suspect that a large number of people who open it would very quickly do what i did which is say this is scurrilous stuff and throw it away this is just using a group of vulnerable people to put out an offensive message which is making them even more vulnerable

5240299 despite having the countrys biggest housing crisis with the largest affordability gap between average earnings and average house prices and the biggest gap between housing delivery and demand for new homes these findings reflect the regional impact of the credit crunch and the massive down turn in the housing market
5240300 this is a crucial issue for local planning authorities the sudden down turn in planning applications should enable councils planning departments to concentrate on delivering local plans for new housing and employment while the redundancy announcements by developers should release much needed skilled planners to be employed by councils
5240301 right now there is a legal requirement to produce epcs for new commercial buildings commercial properties offered for sale or lease and all public access buildings but there remains a shortage of trained and qualified assessors to provide those certificates
5240302 our experience backed by this survey shows that business leaders are clearly making the tough decisions necessary to survive the downturn central and local government however are much slower to react
5240303 at the moment too much government resource is focused at hindering business with red tape such as the new epcs with not enough focused on initiatives that help business to create wealth business not government will create the wealth to lead us out of the downturn so government must remove the blocks that prevent or hinder businesses
5240304 i think so im trying not 2 step on my dress
5240305 and i think its going 2 b a smooth ride
5240306 i would have preferred to start with a victory but the draw was a fair result
5240307 the players who were at uefa euro 2008 are not at 100 per cent yet but i see my team developing in training every day well need some time to perform at our best but our time will come
5240308 when you kick off with a draw at bayern you have to be content
5240309 it was a spectacular match and a great start for me and my team
5240310 im very very disappointed we played a convincing game with good football my team believed in themselves until the end and we should have made it 3 3 but we started at home with a bitter defeat and no points thats bad
5240311 the third match in a three match week is always the hardest so its great my team put in a performance like the one we produced today said the man who earned fc twente a uefa champions league third qualifying round berth last season
5240312 but there is still a lot of work ahead for us we have great expectations for this season
5240313 there has been a deepening of uk pakistan relations we wish him mr musharraf well in the future
5240314 we support any measures which support democracy and the rule of law
5240315 i think it is the right thing for him to have done
5240316 i think it in no way detracts from the strong record he has as being a staunch ally of the west and its fight against islamic terrorism
5240317 i think the coalition government in pakistan now needs to focus on two issues the parlous economic state of the country and working with its allies to combat the ongoing threat of regional terrorism
5240318 the insanity of war has robbed me of everything i knew and loved
5240319 songs that play together like some kind of musical of the mind

5240323 this is another opportunity for us to progress our preparations against a very good french side and at the same time re introduce some players to our squad
5240324 we have competition for places across the squad and that intensity is going to be vital for us after tomorrows game we only have one more opportunity in pre season before the guinness premiership starts so it is very important we see a step up in what we are trying to achieve
5240325 we appreciate tomorrows game will be another step up physically and that is a good thing it is up to us to generate good habits now and build on them
5240326 nobody needs to tell any employee or player at gloucester rugby simply how important the community is to the club and that is why we were so keen to use this day to get as many people into the club as possible
5240327 our supporter base is quite simply the best around and for supporters to have the chance to meet the players practice skills on the pitch and get involved with the club it is a great way to start the season
5240328 so much has happened in recent seasons off the field but we felt as a club it was crucial to try and show our supporters and the community we are there for them and give them something not many other clubs do
5240329 there will also be the opportunity for supporters to tour the c amp g grandstand changing rooms and hospitality suites in some ways it is a bit of a thank you for all their support and it will be a great way to kick off the season
5240330 with the us success of the race against pain website it became obvious that the ideas and knowledge from this community could benefit those pain sufferers outside of the states

5240333 partisan challengers who have obtained a list of returned letters shouldnt be allowed to strip ohio voters of their right to update their addresses
5240334 voter suppression and intimidation is driven by a desire to maintain the status quo concluded judge
5240335 these acts are carried out in an effort to deprive certain americans especially those most marginalized of a voice in our democracy election day is the great equalizer it is the one day where if all was right in our democracy it would not matter if a person is rich poor black white educated or not we all would have the same amount of power
5240336 oh you know what its like theres nothing you could have really said to make me feel better and people have their own dramas in life you know
5240337 for better for worse including being forced to listen to the same problem stuck on repeat basically the message i was trying to give worked people who rant non stop about their problems and have done so for years drain away your will to live

5240398 the formation of this joint venture is a significant step in our plans for the china market
5240399 along with our current operations we will have a much larger scale and a cost effective manufacturing base on which to build up our business in china and for overseas markets

5240405 seb du hast hier in deutschland nun schon das siebte mal in folge gesiegt das bedeutet dass du jetzt die f hrung in der fahrerwertung bernommen hast der rekord von marcus gr nholm siebenmal die gleiche veranstaltung zu gewinnen ist dir ebenso gelungen dieses wochenende hatte man den eindruck es fiel dir leicht war dieser sieg verglichen mit den vorherigen sechs siegen der leichteste
5240406 immer wieder h re ich die gleiche frage ich kann es schwer sagen tats chlich lief es von beginn an gut f r mich es gab zum gl ck nicht viel regen was die sache etwas leichter gemacht hat ich habe ziemlich schnell und zu einem fr hen zeitpunkt meinen rhythmus gefunden und bin auch ein paar risiken eingegangen dennoch musste ich die gesamte rallye hindurch k mpfen
5240407 hattest du an diesem wochenende irgendwann das gef hl dass einer der anderen fahrer druck macht
5240408 man ist immer unter druck wenn man hier als favorit ins rennen geht hat man es nicht leicht da jeder ein gutes ergebnis von dir erwartet wenn du aber in die erste pr fung gehst vergisst du das alles und gibst einfach gas
5240409 ein doppelsieg f r citro n hier ist ein gutes omen f r die weiteren asphalt rallyes in dieser saison und nat rlich f r die herstellermeisterschaft
5240410 das ist die beste position f r die restliche saison die rallye in neuseeland wird schwierig da dort immer viel schotter auf der strecke liegt wir haben gesehen was in der t rkei passiert ist das kann in neuseeland genau so sein ich bin jedenfalls gl cklich ber meine f hrung in der meisterschaft wir haben immerhin einen vorsprung von vier punkten
5240411 daniel der veranstalter hat dieses jahr die streckenf hrung leicht ver ndert und es gab weniger pr fungen im milit rgebiet war die diesj hrige streckenf hrung verglichen mit denen der letzten jahre gut
5240412 es gab keine gro en unterschiede da lediglich die letzj hrige pr fung in der entgegengesetzten richtung gefahren wurde man kennt die stellen an denen es eventuell rutschig ist mit den baumholder pr fungen sind wir vertraut

5240440 when these people came back and were telling these horrific stories and our superiors were egging people on some people were actually volunteering to go over there and it just seemed like justified homicide it didnt seem right to me
5240441 to blow open the doors with explosives and then to assist in both securing the premises and detaining the adult male occupants
5240442 during these searches he witnessed several instances of unjustified abuse unwarranted detention humiliation and looting by fellow soldiers much of which he said was ignored by his superior officers

5240447 despite their ineptitude in a lot of other areas and how poor they are at governing one of the things the bush administration has been very good at is using administrative mechanisms to control policy outcomes
5240448 i have worked on regulatory issues inside the beltway since 1976 and have watched five presidents come and go
5240449 the bush administration is the most hostile and aggressive toward these agencies by a couple of orders of magnitude making the reagan era look relatively benign
5240450 no matter who is elected in november it will take years to repair this damage
5240451 politics is injected and elevated into decisions where science and rational judgment should prevail
5240452 politics supersedes scientific and technical information that is critical to protecting our environment and health and safety at home and in the workplace
5240453 many of the politicization scandals in this administration came from cases where unqualified or inexperienced people got into key jobs often with the power to hire others or control information flows
5240454 despite the presidents promise to bring business like thinking to the federal government the bush administration has overseen or at least permitted a significant expansion of both the height and width of the federal hierarchy
5240455 there have never been more layers at the top of government nor more occupants at each layer
5240456 weve been particularly concerned that some of the scientific community is being co opted by political manipulation and that policy is being presented as fact
5240457 the power to coordinate information collection and to review proposed final regulations in a policy office of the white house made omb the equivalent of a political censor over agency actions
5240458 protect his right to select appointees based not only on their managerial prowess but also on their commitment to his policy agenda and their ability to advance articulate and defend it
5240459 one of the things this administration is going to be most known for is that they provided a lot of special access for business interests
5240460 theyve allowed an unprecedented level of involvement by private interests in creating political policy with regard to regulation with regard to rules their energy policy their greenhouse gas policy all of that

5240529 the professional developers conference on october 27 and the windows hardware engineering conference the following week represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7
5240530 we are both looking forward to turning our attention and blogging energies towards the community outside microsoft
5240531 the audience of enthusiasts bloggers and those that are the most passionate about windows represent the folks we are dedicating this blog to with this blog were opening up a two way discussion about how we are making windows 7 windows has all the challenges of every large scale software project picking features designing them developing them and delivering them with high quality windows has an added challenge of doing so for an extraordinarily diverse set of customers as a team and as individuals on the team we continue to be humbled by this responsibility we strongly believe that success for windows 7 includes an open and honest and two way discussion about how we balance all of these interests and deliver software on the scale of windows we promise and will deliver such a dialog with this blog planning a product like windows involves systematic learning from customers of all types in terms of planning the release weve been working with a wide variety of customers and partners pc makers hardware developers enterprise customers developers and more since the start of the project we also continue our broad consumer learning through telemetry customer experience improvement program usability studies and more one area this blog will soon explore is all the different ways we learn from customers and the marketplace that inform the release we have two significant events for developers and the overall ecosystem around windows this fall the professional developers conference winhec the following week both represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7 this blog will provide context over the next 2 months with regular posts about the behind the scenes development of the release and continue through the release of the product
5240532 in leading up to this blog we have seen a lot of discussion in blogs about what microsoft might be trying to accomplish by maintaining a little bit more control over the communication around windows 7 some might say that this is a significant understatement

5240537 we players are not machines and when someone is the focus of so much talk it can affect them at a personal level we must protect him
5240538 we need to refine and improve what we did wrong but were not worried as that was only the first official game and were still in pre season
5240539 but even so if you lose games like this you go home annoyed
5240540 can he get the title for liverpool as ronaldo did last season why not they are different players ronaldo comes in from the side but fernando is a real striker he has everything to be the best player this season
5240541 there was nothing on when he got the ball versus sunderland but he scores a few goals like that he is always looking for the target and as soon as he gets space to shoot he shoots and often scores
5240542 he is a megastar now he played wonderfully at the euros and always when you need him he scores very important goals he is a top quality player and for me he is the best striker in the world if you are speaking about a real striker he is the pinnacle he is everything not only in normal games but more often than not in special games

5240556 i have the evidence letter and whoever denies that is free to challenge me
5240557 the rdc is forgetting that the government took over the entire estates land we kcc no longer have any access to that land and there is no way we could influence its allocation
5240558 i have no idea about that new developer but if the rdc has evidence let him produce it

5240571 that was a nice refinance boom we had wednesday morning although i wish it had lasted a little longer
5240572 wednesday was one of the biggest days the industry has ever seen
5240573 if you were out last week you must wonder what all the fuss is about after all mortgage rates only fell 0 02 for the week never mind the several point rallies and sell offs in between and stocks rose a modest 108 points never mind the 1000 point range in between along the way the two year treasury yield fell briefly to 1 85 and fed funds futures signaled sub 2 00 funds rates later this year for this weeks fed meeting there is an 82 probability for a 50bp cut to 3 00 and 28 probability for a 25bp cut to 3 25 the feds surprise 0 75 rate cut on tuesday and the prospect of a government led economic bail out quelled some panic in the markets and returned stocks and bonds from their extremes much of the talk swirling around the mortgage industry centered on the higher conforming loan limits proposed in bushs economic package jumbo fixed rates meanwhile continue to worsen and ended the week nearly 1 00 higher than conforming rates more than three points worse in price the spread between mortgage and treasury yields hit 2 40 last week close to record highs of 2 60 set in late 2002 this spread is driven by many factors not the least of which is interest rate volatility when rates settle down i e when the fed is not expected to cut or raise rates any time soon look for this spread to collapse producing relatively lower mortgage rates lower short term funding costs widened the difference between two year and ten year treasury yields to 1 40 resulting in the steepest yield curve we have seen since late 2004
5240574 odds for more rate cuts have done nothing but increase and traders have begun rumors of another rate cut prior to the march 18 fomc meeting

5240579 as more rate cuts were built in to the yield curve short term rates fell 0 10 more than long term ones and funding costs fell accordingly the difference between mortgage and treasury yields remained steady the spread has not widened appreciably in three months and mortgage bankers are enjoying a healthy decline in mortgage rates lock volume was strong last week and refinance activity is picking up servicing prices have moved in to two camps a high priced one that believes the record slowdown in prepayment speeds is here to stay and a relatively low priced one that believes speeds will accelerate soon prices for conforming whole loans therefore are as widely scattered as we have seen in some time jumbo fixed rates continue to languish at approximately 0 75 over conforming rates and rumors swirled last week about a temporary increase in agency lending limits the mortgage bankers association has changed course and is now backing stand alone legislation that would allow fannie mae and freddie mac to purchase jumbo loans up to 625 000 nationwide

5240582 weve got a small squad but we believe its a good one and i want to keep everybody involved this season
5240583 i was delighted with the attitude and the character we showed for the spurs game and i want to have a look at a couple of games before making a final decision
5240584 im pleased to have added justin hoyte to the squad but we have no more bids in at the moment and it may stay that way
5240585 it may leave us a little bit short but then we have players who have proved they can play in a number of positions villa only had a small squad last season and they finished above us in the table
5240586 i like the idea of everybody having a chance of playing on the other hand i do not want to leave us exposed so its a situation that needs a lot of thought
5240587 i think it is the right thing for him to have done
5240588 i think it in no way detracts from the strong record he has as being a staunch ally of the west and its fight against islamic terrorism

5240596 a mobi domain helps eliminate reservations about the ability of sites to work on mobile phones especially as the number of mobile devices around the world continues to increase we fully support dotmobis ongoing mission to ensure that sites such as ringtones mobi are optimized for mobile devices
5240597 ringtones mobi was one of dotmobis premium names and while it was exciting to see ringtones mobi sold at the t r a f f i c east auction last october for 145 000 its more exciting to see content come alive under the name and its great to see a site that gives a wide variety of musicians especially independent ones access to a global audience who are ready to buy and listen to their music

5240607 im particularly fond of the balliol aircraft they have a great colour scheme with the streak of blue on the tail
5240608 we can confirm that 2 para were involved in the incident in which three civilians tragically lost their lives a full investigation will be carried out and our sympathies are with the families of the killed and injured civilians at this time
5240609 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5240610 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time the casualties were treated at a nearby isaf medical facility where two of them children remain seriously ill
5240611 isaf deeply regrets the tragedy of this incident when women and children were killed and injured as a result of an imminent insurgent attack from a position where they would have known women and children were present the enemies of afghanistan have yet again shown a complete disregard for the lives of the innocent who they claim to fight for
5240612 of course we d have wished for a slightly better result than places three and four at our home race but the two peugeots couldn t be beaten here the team and the drivers achieved the maximum and kept the title fight open this means that we ll be seeing a thrilling finale at silverstone
5240613 it was a good race for rocky and me we were both quick even in traffic you can see that we ve learned a lot since the beginning of the season unfortunately we had no chance against the peugeots nevertheless we still have hopes for the championship we ve only got a two point gap to marc gen and nicolas minassian we ll do everything we can at silverstone to clinch the title
5240614 in terms of speed we wanted to be closer to our team mates and we managed that we drove similar lap times so we re very satisfied in that respect at the previous races we were still lacking something we know it s difficult against peugeot but we ve still been making maximum use of the potential for audi so far we want to do that at silverstone as well and decide the championship in our favour
5240615 that was a really tough weekend for us my first stint in the race was terrible i had no grip whatsoever i can t remember ever having fought so hard with the r10 the second stint was a bit better but in the third stint i again had absolutely no feeling for the car we need to find out what was wrong and solve the problem before silverstone so that we can drive a great season finale there
5240616 we already had problems with our car in qualifying unfortunately they continued in the race the car was inconsistent dindo capello and i both had the same feeling still we were able to move forwards up to third place at times
5240617 it was a pretty uneventful race the peugeots were able to fully play out their advantage in the first two hours they saddled us with a lap before the situation became a little more balanced we saw a nice fight among our two cars positions kept changing but then alex pr mat had a slow puncture he had to pit a little earlier but fortunately late enough so that this didn t mean an extra stop the other car had also a slow puncture just before the end of the race apparently there was a lot of debris on the track too bad that this caused dindo and allan to miss the podium again but we ll make up for that at silverstone

5240635 mandatory sales have been very strong relative to best efforts the reason mortgages are once again trading with zero duration and hedge costs are low when treasury yields drop the market thinks more rate volatility is ahead mortgage to treasury spreads widen and mortgage rates do not change when treasury yields rise the market thinks volatility will subside mortgage to treasury spreads tighten and mortgage rates do not change the former rates down has been mostly the case lately and mortgage yields are trading a whopping 2 09 over five year treasuries thats the widest since 2003 jumbo core prices worsened relative to conforming in the past day or so but not enough to call it a trend quite yet
5240636 when the tide goes out you find out whos been swimming naked
5240637 stand by for a tumultuous 2008 as the market struggles to move from the shadows back into the light of sounder banking accompanied by fed funds levels at 3 or lower
5240638 mortgage rates are now officially low conforming loans with rates in the low to mid 5 range are streaming in to pipelines mortgage rates fell 0 55 in the past two weeks alone and thirty year fixed rates are near levels where they spent much of 2003 and 2004 the spread between mortgage and treasury rates has stopped widening for the moment therefore as treasury rates dropped mortgage rates came down mortgage yields traded about 2 10 over equivalent treasuries in the past few weeks while credit is still tight and property values very much in question we expect loan volume to pick up nicely this week it has been seasonally low for the entire industry loan volume is usually about half of its usual pace over the holidays and this time around was no different jumbo fixed rates continue to languish prices are about 2 points behind equivalent conforming loans and rates hover at historical wides roughly 0 75 over conforming rates the jumbo market remains a tale of two investor types portfolio jumbo arm rates are aggressive as funding costs drop and banks seek to fill portfolios jumbo fixed rates are high as the securities market struggles along offering no good outlet for aggregators bankers cheered as the yield curve steepened tough economic news pushed short term rates down sharply the difference between ten year and two year treasuries closed last week at 1 11
5240639 the dust is still settling after the fed used an ax instead of a scalpel to cut rates as barrons put it mortgages have been volatile tuesday prices rose 0 50 thursday prices fell 0 75 the yield curve steepened the 10 year treasury yield rose 0 16 more than the 2 year yield credit spreads especially those affecting jumbo core loans have moved in ever so slightly for everything other than cream puff loans jumbo core yields remain at very high levels relative to agencies mortgage to treasury spreads narrowed mortgages currently yield 1 65 more than treasuries about 0 10 less than pre fed levels demand for mortgages is up banks usually increase their purchases of mortgages when the yield curve is steep
5240640 jumbo loan prices of both the adjustable and fixed rate varieties had a banner week spreads while not back to pre collapse levels are trading at levels that might even be called respectable our sources tell us that while lower credit tranches are not yet trading well the aaa pieces are as well received as they have been in months rate sheets came back in stair steps with wells posting strong fixed rate bids early in the week and citimortgage and chase posting very strong arm levels late in the week and today while spread markets are still volatile we are getting more optimistic by the day corporate bonds junk bonds and libor swap spreads are all moving tighter because liquidity has returned to the financial markets banks are lending the commercial paper market has stopped its collapse and libor has returned to approximately 0 50 over treasuries
5240641 inflation is not a problem in a recession and certainly not in one caused by the bursting of the largest housing bubble in us history be definition those are deflationary events if we have a simple slowdown i think rates drop to 4 or less if we see a recession short term rates will drop below 3
5240642 mortgage rates gave up all of the ground they had gained last week a combination of higher long term treasury yields and wider mortgage to treasury spreads did the trick jumbo spreads didnt fare much better and continued to widen spreads of all kinds remain wide and the markets dont seem convinced that current fed actions or bushs proposal will help much

5240651 if you needed a conforming fixed loan last week was your week not so much if you were looking for a jumbo loan conforming mortgages soared chopping a full 0 25 off of fixed mortgage rates jumbo loan prices unfortunately continued their downward spiral relative to their conforming brethren aaa jumbo tranches continue to trade poorly and jumbos are trading a full point worse than a month ago meanwhile mortgages had a decent week relative to treasuries mortgage rates are still at four year wides 2 00 higher than treasuries but they reversed some of their recent dramatic ascent and bankers have reason for hope the yield curve is steeper than it has been in three years and check out august fed funds futures 3 10
5240652 your eyes do not deceive you treasury yields plummeted last week and mortgage rates barely budged in fact mortgage rates rose 0 30 relative to duration equivalent treasuries the spread between mortgages and treasuries eclipsed 2 00 for the first time in years back in 2002 mortgages traded 2 50 over the curve for a brief period for much of 2004 2005 and 2006 the spread was 1 25 it is not a coincidence that spreads are wide today like they were in 2002 and 2003 then as now the fed was in a rate cutting mode and there was great uncertainty as to the future of interest rates when such uncertainty exists buyers of mortgages demand a greater relative yield to compensate for prepayment risk hence the wide mortgage to treasury spreads so what will it take to narrow the spread some certainty about interest rates if the fed stops cutting rates sometime next year and signals that they intend to leave rates alone for some time it is very likely that mortgage to treasury spreads will come down in the meantime short term rates are very volatile fed funds futures pushed to levels not seen in some time august 2008 futures traded down to 3 67 on fears of economic slowdown there is only a 50 chance for a rate cut in december but after that significant cuts are built in also the yield curve steepened 0 80 a level not seen since early 2005 recall that the difference between two year and ten year treasuries was 0 10 only a year ago as for credit spreads core jumbo prices held in last week although we saw several price hits worsened for high cltv loans fannie mae also announced price adjustments that will affect core agency loans in the high ltv low fico bands the move by fannie mae was significant it was the first such credit adjustment to their core products in many many years
5240653 jumbo loan prices are holding steady two weeks ago spreads moved tighter and they remain at decent levels equal to pre collapse levels of the summer a few jumbo securities have traded and liquidity is creeping back the same cannot be said for sub prime loans the bbb abx index set a new low last week in spite of hopes for a bail out from the master conduit proposed by the treasury regarding conforming products mortgage rates did not fall as far as treasury yields last week the prospect of greater volatility pushed mortgage rates 0 15 higher relative to treasuries the yield curve as measured by the difference between two and ten year treasuries also steepened by 0 15 financial companies that borrow short and lend long cheered the news
5240654 fridays 366 point decline rates as only the 626th largest in since the start of the dow in 1896 put in another way we have seen drops of this magnitude or worse on 2 of all trading days over the past 111 years

5240660 there is a slim chance it might move out to sea but we cant predict exactly what might happen
5240661 the picture i paint of the causes of transvestitism shows the transvestite as a man afflicted with a developmental abnormality it is by no means a positive lifestyle choice the transvestite is driven by urges he cannot control and doesnt want to behave in ways which normal people will naturally find abhorrent the transvestite is the victim of an affliction that sets him apart from his fellow men and from women
5240662 i do not believe that transvestitism is something which can easily be integrated into a mans personality i see it as an alien growth on the male psyche not a natural part of being human that most men somehow repress in fact i would go so far as to suggest that the attempt to integrate transvestitism into ones self image can seriously distort the transvestites view of himself and the world the view that transvestitism is merely an expression of an innate feminine side to our nature is not helpful in explaining why it happens who is affected and why transvestitism is experienced just the way it is men trying to cope with transvestitism often appear to have quite fragmented images of themselves and of their gender and sometimes serious confusion about their sexual orientation all of which is quite understandable if we think of transvestitism as an abnormal and disfiguring growth on the side of an otherwise normal psyche

5240675 the u s men with schroeder as team captain won silver medals in 1984 and 1988 and had a fourth place showing in 1992 but they dropped to sixth in 2000 seventh in 2004 and had three coaching changes since

5240756 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5240757 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5240758 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5240759 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5240760 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5240761 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5240762 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5240763 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do

5240767 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5240768 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5240769 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education

5240773 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5240774 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5240775 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5240776 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5240777 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5240778 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5240779 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5240780 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5240781 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5240782 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5240783 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5240784 this is a planning took where all things are going
5240785 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5240786 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5240787 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5240788 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5240789 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5240790 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5240791 cand pornim sa facem un lucru nobil aparent imposibil universul coalizeaza cu noi si vom duce la bun sfarsit ceea ce am inceput
5240792 toata lumea imi spune ali nu ma intrebati de ce pentru ca eu oricum am trei nume frumoase
5240793 it felt like we were waiting for a monthly employment report on friday only we were waiting for countrywides cfc earnings report cfc reported less loss than expected which is good for countrywide and good for the mortgage industry everybody was nervous when cfcs stock price nearly dropped below 12 it rallied all the way back to 17 in a relief rally on friday cfcs balance sheet improved on the liability side as well barrons reports that the yield on cmcs debt fell 0 40 and the cost of cfc credit default swaps essentially an insurance policy against countrywide going out of business dropped 1 00 all of this good price action is predicated on cfc weathering the storm as for the rest of the credit spectrum abx indices hit new lows last week but jumbo core spreads hung in at respectable levels

5240796 the community had been raising red flags for months and sometimes years
5240797 its a mystery to us how you can have the number of inspectors that were practically living in that building and have that level of disaster
5240798 it exposed an area that the city had never looked at this comprehensively when we looked at it we found a lot of areas that could be improved
5240799 this wasnt any building this was a public spectacle this was a high rise toxic vacant building that was under deconstruction

5240803 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5240804 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5240805 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5240806 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5240807 because earlier studies had estimated that males accounted for about 10 percent of the cases of bulimia and anorexia which can be fatal
5240808 the military is very strict and theyre afraid theyre going to get chucked out
5240809 not im fat and gross and need to go on a diet
5240810 a teenage boy shouldnt be eating what his 110 pound dieting mother would eat
5240811 its normal for a half gallon of milk and a loaf of bread to disappear every 48 hours if theres a teenage boy in the house
5240812 when parents are hung up on their own weight issues their kids are at higher risk
5240813 but one of the problems i see for male eating disorder patients is just being taken seriously
5240814 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5240815 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5240816 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5240817 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5240818 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5240819 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5240820 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5240821 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5240822 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5240823 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5240824 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5240825 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5240826 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5240827 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5240828 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5240829 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5240830 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5240831 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5240832 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5240833 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5240834 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5240835 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5240836 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5240837 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5240838 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5240839 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5240840 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5240841 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5240842 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5240843 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5240844 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5240845 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5240846 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5240847 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5240848 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5240849 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5240850 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5240851 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5240852 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5240853 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5240854 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5240855 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5240856 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5240857 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5240858 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5240859 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5240860 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5240861 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5240862 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5240863 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5240864 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5240865 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5240866 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5240867 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5240868 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5240869 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5240870 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5240871 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5240872 persistence of airway responsiveness commonly referred to as twitchy airways is a major reason why asthma in girls may persist or develop past the onset of puberty
5240873 while our results were not unexpected they do point to intriguing potential mechanisms to explain the gender differences in asthma incidence and severity especially intriguing is that the differences in gender begin at the time of transition into early puberty
5240874 for as long as possible since these individuals offer a unique opportunity that may provide insight in the natural course of asthma both in male and female subjects
5240875 we are now able to perform a secondary analysis with an emphasis on those who have reached clinical normalcy
5240876 it is possible in the future that therapy may be developed that would be directed toward the mechanistic basis for persistence of airway responsiveness
5240877 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5240878 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5240879 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5240880 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5240881 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5240882 women and men are different equal treatment of men and women does not result in equal outcomes
5240883 i very much welcome this report and have given an undertaking that the government will look carefully at the issues it raises and the recommendations it makes
5240884 vulnerable women who are not a danger to society should not be going to prison
5240885 youve probably never had to go what theyve gone through
5240886 we want to get closer to the teams on top its also a good stepping board for our game against jru
5240887 were trying very hard to manage the situation i guess from this day on well be back we know the importance of our next four games that will bring us where we really want to finish our confidence is back
5240888 we also made our defense look very good were seeing good things even in practices
5240889 was sen barack obama a citizen of indonesia at any point in his life
5240890 we knew it was fast but 3 53 314 we just cant believe it
5240891 thats going to go down in history that time wont be broken in a long time were the best team in the world
5240892 this is pinnacle weve been working on this since before sydney for the best part of a decade and what a performance
5240893 it was phenomenal yesterday i was pretty down after the first couple of rounds because i wasnt my normal self and didnt want to let these guys down
5240894 i know how much these guys have sacrificed for this one event its just fantastic to be part of this team weve come a long way in four years
5240895 in the event the employee with a disability shall receive any benefits including medical surgical or hospital benefits under any group plan covering nonoccupational disability contributed to wholly or partially by the employer then the amounts so paid to the employee from the group plan shall be credited to or against any compensation payments

5240900 other people will pay good money for this view and i get it for free every day
5240901 were all sad to see it end but the guys are still happy what a feat
5240902 for instance the roof of that building has 700 yards of concrete youd be forever pouring it in buckets but we poured it all in one day with the pump
5240903 there are a lot of things that people dont see
5240904 weve still got a long ways to go its not time to relax just yet
5240905 this is my ex wife treat the scene with respect
5240906 detectives if there was any reason to believe that this was a traumatic death and they stated no therefore the homicide suspicious death protocol was not followed
5240907 the protocol was not being followed because it was felt at that time by all parties that there were not signs of foul play or trauma for this death investigation
5240908 make observations and document those observations as part of their investigation and processing of a crime scene
5240909 when they bagged the hands that was when i asked the question you know do you think anything is out of whack here

5240918 i want to be the guy we can depend on and just continue to work hard and practice hard
5240919 he seemed very upbeat about the situation you never want to see somebody get hurt but he said he was just going to take a little time off
5240920 right now they have me working at right tackle primarily and i feel comfortable there but whatever the team needs me to do i can do
5240921 struggling to get by day to day and putting their long term plans on hold at a time in their lives when they should be building better for their future the rising cost of living combined with the debt they are carrying and makes paying bills and making ends meet a source of stress and struggle
5240922 they do not believe they have enough money to keep pace with the cost of living
5240923 they are entering their adult lives saddled with debilitating debt and a changing economy that offers fewer stable good paying jobs especially for young people without a college education

5240934 it breaks the stereotype of what a small efficient electric car can be
5240935 it shows how much personality and style these kinds of cars can have
5240936 i looked at stealth planes like the f 117 fighter plane it has faceted surfacing and i used it in bits and pieces in the design

5241224 si svegliano a met e rimangono con i sogni mezzi aperti
5241225 lunica cosa che mi fa stare in piedi che siamo ancora sotto lo stesso cielo
5241226 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5241227 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5241228 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5241229 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5241230 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5241231 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5241232 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5241233 the market is telling us we need it and we need it badly
5241234 ze komen ook nog van het hoofd van een organisatie die zelf niet alleen buitensporig geweld heeft toegepast maar dat bovendien richtte op burgers en burgerdoelen in het bijzonder in 1999 in joegoslavi
5241235 sie hat so eine lockerheit bekommen das ist gro artig
5241236 vorher habe ich gedacht ja das jucken kommt aber ich wei auch auf was die jungs alles verzichten mussten um hier dabei zu sein
5241237 ich wei dass ich niemals mehr dort sein wollte denn die zwei jahre vorher h tte ich nicht durchgestanden
5241238 het is bijzonder dat je hen juist in die omstandigheden mag bijstaan
5241239 na de havo studeerde ik twee jaar lang voeding en di tiek in amsterdam gedeeltelijk uit eigenwijsheid
5241240 mijn klasgenoten gingen f naar de pabo f naar de hbo verpleegkunde ik moest dus wat anders
5241241 eerst op de afdeling nefrologie daarna op reumatologie ik wist al dat ik naar oncologie wilde dus toen er na anderhalf jaar een plaats vrijkwam bij het diakonessenhuis was de keus snel gemaakt het is vooral het psychosociale aspect van de verpleging dat me aanspreekt het is een kunst voor me om tijd vrij te maken voor mijn pati nten om er echt voor hen te zijn in de kleine dingen kun je veel voor hen betekenen
5241242 toch zijn juist deze mensen dikwijls enorm rustig dat is ook wel eens moeilijk want er is ogenschijnlijk niet altijd grond voor tegelijkertijd is het mooi om te zien dat pati nten soms heel sterk de nabijheid van god kunnen ervaren zo geven mensen mij soms meer dan ik hun kan geven
5241243 er komen vijf tot tien kinderen in de leeftijd van 10 tot 14 jaar veelal kinderen uit eenoudergezinnen die het prachtig vinden dat ze wat aandacht krijgen we vertellen uit de bijbel en doen spelletjes het is verbazend hoe weinig kennis de kinderen hebben god is groot en wij zijn klein dat snappen ze al niet eens het blijft dan ook lastig om de boodschap over te brengen om een lichtend licht te zijn
5241244 mijn ene zus is verloskundige en arts de andere werkt in het speciaal onderwijs we zijn alle drie heel verschillend maar het is opvallend dat we juist die eigenschap delen dat sociale hebben we absoluut van huis uit meegekregen onze ouders zijn altijd erg betrokken
5241245 tien dagen lang naar het meer van gen ve met stichting ichthus omdat we naar het buitenland gaan voelt het voor mij als een echte vakantie en als ik dan de gasten zo intens zie genieten geeft dat veel voldoening
5241246 opposti schieramenti lessero rispettivamente nellopera la cinica denigrazione del matrimonio concepito come prigione e tortura morale e la sua esaltante glorificazione come atto di civilt cos alto da meritare qualunque sacrificio per preservarne linviolabilit
5241247 ho visto amici fratelli amanti sposi i cui rapporti furono radicalmente mutati la cui situazione fu interamente capovolta dallarrivo casuale o voluto di una terza persona
5241248 therefore it is often done as an expression of contempt creativity or both vandalism is only a meaningful concept in a culture that recognizes history and archaeology like other similar terms barbarian barbary and philistine the term
5241249 attendu que la colonne vend me est un monument d nu de toute valeur artistique tendant perp tuer par son expression les id es de guerre et de conqu te qui taient dans la dynastie imp riale mais que r prouve le sentiment dune nation r publicaine le citoyen courbet met le v u que le gouvernement de la d fense nationale veuille bien lautoriser d boulonner cette colonne
5241250 but we have very little evidence as to the growth of the debate
5241251 supported by the holy scriptures and the fathers we declare unanimously in the name of the holy trinity that there shall be rejected and removed and cursed one of the christian church every likeness which is made out of any material and colour whatever by the evil art of painters if anyone ventures to represent the divine image charakt r of the word after the incarnation with material colours let him be anathema if anyone shall endeavour to represent the forms of the saints in lifeless pictures with material colours which are of no value for this notion is vain and introduced by the devil and does not rather represent their virtues as living images in himself let him be anathema
5241252 satan misled men so that they worshipped the creature instead of the creator the law of moses and the prophets cooperated to remove this ruin but the previously mentioned demiurge of evil gradually brought back idolatry under the appearance of christianity
5241253 but i also venerate the matter through which salvation came to me as if filled with divine energy and grace
5241254 all religious images not of our faith are idols all images of our faith are icons to be venerated
5241255 before their destruction the buddhas had however twice in the past been attacked by the less efficient artillery of
5241256 lord what work was here what clattering of glasses what beating down of walls what tearing up of monuments what pulling down of seats what wresting out of irons and brass from the windows what defacing of arms what demolishing of curious stonework what tooting and piping upon organ pipes and what a hideous triumph in the market place before all the country when all the mangled organ pipes vestments both copes and surplices together with the leaden cross which had newly been sawn down from the green yard pulpit and the service books and singing books that could be carried to the fire in the public market place were heaped together
5241257 we brake sic down about a hundred superstitious pictures and seven fryers sic hugging a nun and the picture of god and christ and divers others very superstitious and 200 had been broke down afore i came we took away 2 popish inscriptions with ora pro nobis for honor and we beat down a great stoneing cross on the top of the church
5241258 i am just on the verge of finishing a script i am working on about the functioning and psychology of media so far you have seen the media exposing things and now i want to expose the media in all its naked glory
5241259 the media has transformed from a truth telling machinery to a power mongering and money making enterprise
5241260 watching with glee someone else fall down and to be ripped to shreds
5241261 they tend to fall in love more with the way they rip the film apart much more than they hate the film
5241262 when they journalists get a certain whiff of an interesting story on someone their greatest fear would be that it will be denied by the person
5241263 it is primarily because most of the mumbai media hobnobs and rubs shoulders with the film people
5241264 the film people out of their fear and greed and in order to use the media people open their doors to them and almost become informants to the media about the rest of their colleagues in the industry
5241265 media looses its primary objective and tends to get embroiled in the camp culture of the industry
5241266 i dont believe that the media is so dumb it was unintentional and when i wrote the 11 things it was all in good humour i even made fun of myself in the blog why is it being taken further
5241267 theres been a retracement in the dollar partly on profit taking but mainly because commodities have moved back higher and commodities seem to be wagging the fx market dog
5241268 i suspect continued weakness in the euro as the figures coming out of europe are going to be poor
5241269 there has been a tug of war between negative fundamentals such as the economic slowdown and positive factors for corporate earnings such as a softer yen and fall in oil prices
5241270 we saw some quite bullish news out of china with them increasing the export tax on aluminum alloy that will help the market
5241271 copper remains as a reasonable tight market even though demand is soft supply side is suffering quite badly
5241272 output at escondida is down around 4 per cent given thats the worlds largest copper mine it is helping to offset any problems on the demand side
5241273 the effects of current weaknesses in the developed economies on demand for our commodities should be minimal driven by ongoing strong demand from the emerging economies
5241274 the dollar has a significant impact on these markets but today were moving with fundamentals and technicals these markets were a bit oversold last week
5241275 i think the whole focus on water and the environment thats going to offer we think big opportunities for us as time goes on
5241276 it impacts us but i think weve kind of managed our way through it pretty well we havent had any big write offs
5241277 some of the best opportunities weve seen in the last 10 years were seeing right now assets are cheap
5241278 in financial services sometimes bad news is good news youll see some great deals done in this cycle and well do some of them
5241279 its another way to simplify the company and run it better
5241280 this is a great way to expand into the united states our base case is to do a spin to investors but i think the appliance business makes sense to a lot of people out there
5241281 i always say look its a good business we run it well
5241282 weve never contemplated it we dont think about it we like the business
5241283 you can zigzag a bit but if you cross that line you are out of bounds and we will steer you back
5241284 antingen avsiktligt valt att vertolka eu s statsst dsregler eller nnu inte riktigt l rt sig f rst hur eu s f rhandlingsmekanism fungerar
5241285 it is critical that we conclude this dialogue as a matter of urgency
5241286 that country zimbabwe needs an opportunity of healing that country needs an opportunity of re starting
5241287 that country needs an opportunity of rehabilitating itself so we as the leaders of the movement for democratic change will remain committed to this dialogue
5241288 the decision that will be reached about what should happen will come from the zimbabwe parties
5241289 the old miller place in spite of what happened there
5241290 i really dont know that there are that many people with set hours monday through friday
5241291 but this year im forcing the kids to reuse their backpacks
5241292 they each cost 50 they like the special cool ones and theyre still holding up
5241293 ive got two teenage boys and they like the brand names
5241294 they shant expect that this year were a cheap bunch here at this house anyway
5241295 i think if parents are going to drive their kids to school and not use bus service thats already available that creates problems
5241296 those choices have to be revisited just like everywhere else
5241297 all of this time ive spent too much time on the net ive dedicated all my life to the net ive ignored everything i have in front of me i forgot what i have in my life ive missed so many things thats impossible for me to grab back so ive decided to take a break for a while i need to unplug my self from all of this i need a life
5241298 ich rate dringend nun wenn die schlacht in nordafrika entschieden ist rommel zu einer art von volkshelden zu erheben das heer hat es unbedingt notwendig

5241340 ein gro er teil der israelis hat keine ahnung was die pal stinensische gesellschaft ist
5241341 die pal stinenser sind weniger ignorant f r vieles was in israel stattfindet weil sie von den israelis schon mehr als 40 jahre besetzt werden aber auch sie kennen die geschichte nicht und verstehen nicht wieso das j dische volk nach dem holocaust einen eigenen staat gr nden musste
5241342 was jetzt passiert sind keine ernsthaften gespr che es verhandeln ein schwacher israelischer ministerpr sident und ein pal stinensischer pr sident der nicht f r den gro teil seiner landsleute spricht
5241343 es handelt sich hier nicht um eine auseinandersetzung um l wasser oder grenzen so etwas k nnte man diplomatisch oder milit risch l sen wir stehen vor einem menschlichen und lokalen konflikt von zwei v lkern die zutiefst davon berzeugt sind auf dem selben st ck land leben zu m ssen
5241344 daf r ist ein mentaler raum notwendig wie wir ihn mit dem
5241345 wir sind verdammt oder gesegnet gemeinsam oder nebeneinander zu leben wenn das akzeptiert von beiden akzeptiert wird kann man einen dialog beginnen
5241346 edward said und ich waren berzeugt dass es keine milit rische l sung f r diesen konflikt gibt
5241347 das schicksal unserer beiden v lker ist untrennbar miteinander verbunden intelligentes musizieren wir h tten schon l ngst anfangen m ssen voneinander zu lernen
5241348 wenn bei uns ein israeli einem syrer oder pal stinenser in der probe zugeh rt hat und versucht mit ihm musikalisch eins zu werden kann er ihn abends nicht ignorieren
5241349 wir sind an diesem ziel viel n her weil das projekt nicht mehr ignoriert werden kann

5241352 the test is a breakthrough because its a simple blood test it could therefore be applied to patients who are at risk those who have a history of exposure or symptoms of the disease
5241353 it would really help the treatment its usually 20 or 30 years before you find out you have it it could have helped me too
5241354 what we are seeing today is a product of exposure decades ago so even though the legislation changed to reduce occupational exposure to asbestos fibres we have a decade lag time between the exposure and the disease

5241368 i know how much these guys have sacrificed for this one event its just fantastic to be part of this team weve come a long way in four years
5241369 weve agreed the basics i hope that can lead to further discussions in the coming weeks
5241370 after discussions in recent weeks with the amaury group and thanks to the intervention of the ioc and a mediator in the shape of jean claude killy we are announcing a new initiative for professional cycling for the coming years

5241376 litsite alaska uses narrative to inspire learning and community building
5241377 we bring people together through storytelling and are using ibms technology to give voice to hundreds of stories about alaska and the lives of alaskans contained within our vast and growing archive
5241378 if we had to record all of the stories ourselves the process would be too costly and time consuming
5241379 but with websphere voice server we can convert a page of text quickly and efficiently for a not for profit site the savings in time and resources are enormous litsite alaska is leveraging ibms technology to produce more audio content than its small staff of freelancers and contract workers could do on its own
5241380 alaskan storytelling is an art form and litsite is playing a critical role in continuing the tradition of preserving alaskan culture
5241381 as a leader in speech technology ibm is pleased to be playing a role in bringing alaskan tradition to life on the web through vocalizing traditional stories and native language
5241382 one of the unique ways ibm research stays ahead of the competition is by looking at innovations that will have a real world impact
5241383 now through our collaborative model we are helping the it market explore new growth opportunities enabled by our state of the art speech technologies and solutions
5241384 speech is becoming increasingly equivalent to text due to decades of research investment such as that of ibm research improved performance and tools for interpreting the resulting text are driving rapid growth for example of speech as an interface to mobile phones
5241385 one particularly effective approach is the voice search model just say what you want and get it to shorten transactions transcription of voicemail and call center conversations to text makes it possible to quickly search and analyze the result creating new growth and flexibility in unified communications and customer service analytics
5241386 the ncsbn places an extremely high value on creating high quality nnaap and mace examinations by purchasing these exams from pearson vue they now have complete ownership of all exam content and control over the process for exam development we are pleased to continue to partner with ncsbn to offer nurse aide and medication aide candidates the most consistent and secure testing experience possible

5241388 as one of the most heavily regulated and complex industries the pharmaceutical sector presents a myriad of unique challenges to organizations during their product development lifecycles and until now few have stepped forward to help
5241389 together conformia and ibm are helping to deliver a clear path for these organizations to follow one that allows them to create an integrated data and information environment resulting in more effective knowledge management programs which they are now demanding
5241390 combining our deep pharmaceutical and biotech expertise with ibms strength in pharmaceutical industry business transformation delivers a groundbreaking new approach to help companies implement new development strategies such as the quality by design paradigm or the ich quality vision this helps solve some of the biggest issues in drug development
5241391 our work with ibm both validates and strengthens our continued dedication to making product development more efficient so scientific leadership can do more with the same resources

5241411 the big improvement in the first half was primarily attributable to the sale of 35 of our interest in the mcelmo dome co2 field effective february 1st which generated a gain of 3 344 000

5241415 prevention of norovirus infection will require a robust immune response and our search for a good adjuvant has led us to immuneregens material
5241416 we welcome this interaction with their scientists and hope to be able to determine if viprovex is well matched with our antigen in the next six months
5241417 the ability of viprovexs active ingredient sar9 met o2 11 substance p to generate not only antibody mediated responses but also support cellular responses via activation of specific immune cells gives us strong reason to expect adjuvant activity when coupled with vaccines such as those being developed by the biodesign institute
5241418 with our compound able to stimulate the immune system via both antibody and cellular immune responses to co administered protein and dna immunogens we optimistically anticipate a productive collaboration with dr arntzens team

5241423 hvis man skal finde et positivt element i beslutningen er det at vi m forvente at specifikationerne for ooxml bliver offentlige klagerne har blandt andet v ret et af isos argumenter for tilbageholdelse af disse

5241479 there is now a concrete proposal with the turkish cypriot association which shows the progress that has been made
5241480 this process only started last september and these types of negotiations are not easy
5241481 with a view to improving relations between the football communities on the island of cyprus
5241482 this is an interim measure prior to a solution to the cyprus problem
5241483 to play in formal competitions you have to be a member of fifa the only way would be to join the greek cypriot league but we are not willing to do this therefore we would only be able to play friendly matches under this proposal
5241484 with a view to improving relations between the football communities on the island
5241485 the offer would allow turkish cypriot clubs to play friendlies against clubs from other countries but we are not talking about the setting up of a new national side
5241486 there are also two conditions attached firstly any clubs wanting to take up the offer would have to be affiliated to the official cypriot fa
5241487 secondly in accordance with our statutes the official fa would have to give its approval for these matches to go ahead
5241488 in order for any matches to be staged in the north the ctfa must sign a document whereby they recognise the cfa and agree to become members this must be done by september

5241530 dont we know how to use this free solar roof heat energy the answer is yes
5241531 solarattic has harnessed the suns solar energy which is collected in every structure in the united states even commercial roofs are active solar collectors that can provide free hot water and heat for industrial processes california state officials reflect the national ignorance about existing technologies that can use this free energy the result california has passed laws to eliminate the roof heat and even require existing homeowners to get rid of the heat if they have to replace their roofs how smart is that if we can use the heat to reduce imported oil and what if the homeowner is already using the free heat energy from their roof to reduce their current energy costs it is time that state and national energy officials get educated in conservation technologies before their collective ignorance results in even more imported oil

5241586 in america were a frontier nation and so the idea is that just beyond the next ridge is the perfect farmland a giant oil field or an abundant supply of timber
5241587 people dont like the idea that the frontier is now closed and weve got to live within limits
5241588 but the oil we are currently producing is of organic origin
5241589 the genius of you americans is that you never make clear cut stupid moves only complicated stupid moves which make the rest of us wonder at the possibility that we might be missing something

5241592 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5241593 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5241594 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5241595 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5241596 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

5241598 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5241599 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5241600 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5241601 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5241602 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5241603 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5241604 who are open to doing something on the production side
5241605 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5241606 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5241607 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5241608 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5241609 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5241610 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5241611 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5241612 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5241613 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5241614 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5241615 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5241616 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5241617 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5241618 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5241619 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5241620 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5241621 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5241622 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5241623 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5241624 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5241625 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5241626 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5241627 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5241628 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5241629 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5241630 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5241631 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5241632 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5241633 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5241634 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5241635 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5241636 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5241637 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5241638 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5241639 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5241640 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5241641 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5241642 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5241643 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5241644 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5241645 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5241646 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5241647 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5241648 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5241649 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5241650 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5241651 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5241652 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5241653 a few issues happened between me and the club so i no longer play for them
5241654 my personal trainer works with brescia and i did a lot of work with him there during the off season so maybe that is where the rumours are from
5241655 but there a few offers i am studying even though i am not in a hurry i want to make the right choice
5241656 at the end of it all the most important thing is that wherever i end up i will give it my absolute all
5241657 i dont want to rush the comeback i want everything to be gradual i have been out for one year and i understand it will take time to get my rhythm back
5241658 everything is going well and very soon you will see me again on the football field
5241659 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5241660 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5241661 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5241662 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5241663 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5241664 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5241665 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5241666 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5241667 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5241668 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5241669 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5241670 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5241671 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5241672 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5241673 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5241674 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5241675 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5241676 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5241677 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5241678 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5241679 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5241680 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5241681 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5241682 chelsea firstly told us yes then no we are looking for a central defender and should we be able to find a name which suits us we will sign him
5241683 it would be useless signing a player who would never play we have a few ideas so we will see
5241684 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5241685 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5241686 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5241687 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5241688 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

5241696 when district travel can be accomplished at a lower cost resources are no longer available for educating students luxurious accommodations or the appearance of luxurious accommodations can cause the public to question whether their tax dollars are being wasted
5241697 its unfortunate that this report was leaked to the press before it had been completed and before our school district response could be included

5241730 ronaldinho heeft de prijs betaald voor zijn losbandige levensstijl bij barcelona
5241731 uitgaan en van het leven genieten dat was nu eenmaal ronaldinho en dan is het natuurlijk normaal dat de messen geslepen worden als je prestaties erop achteruit gaan
5241732 met zijn priv leven moeten we ons niet moeien maar het valt niet te ontkennen dat ook zijn sportprestaties eronder leden op het einde werd hij bijna uitgespuwd wij als spelersgroep hadden het daar ook lastig mee
5241733 de mensen denken dat hij onprofessioneel bezig is net een tijdbom die elk moment in de kleedkamer kan ontploffen het tegendeel is echter waar nu zijn tierlantijntjes tot het verleden behoren is hij een voorbeeld voor iedereen hij wil de beste zijn en dat is hij in mijn ogen ook

5241738 as i understand it yes there are rights of appeal zentais son ernie steiner said outside the court today

5241747 we see this detention as the latest in a series of actions designed to intimidate journalists
5241748 we view with growing alarm signals coming out of fiji including one newspaper raising concern about a consistent siege against media freedoms
5241749 concern is growing that this and other detentions are not spontaneous case by case reactions from an annoyed interim government
5241750 they are more a calculated strategy using any excuse to breed fear amongst the media the only institution maintaining freedoms of speech on a daily basis in the face of what is looking more and more like a military regime media freedom is also under threat in the media tribunal proposed by the regime with powers to fine journalists editors and publishers
5241751 this will act as a court of review on adjudications of the media council complaints committee like so much else in the charter it risks being rigged we dont think the tribunal will do what the regime wants i e muzzle the media so we fear the next step meanwhile the police force which has become little more than an arm of government is being used to threaten and harass journalists and others
5241752 oh my goodness yes im here for you girl i was you nine months ago i was lucky enough to meet the embassy girls otherwise id know nothing
5241753 one had seen it as being quite anthropic the work is relying on the assumption that the reason for our existence is to observe and describe objective social phenomena and is based always on the notion that the existence of human social life validates certain features of the physical world more importantly perhaps and in common with most of the positivist writers hart overlooked the unconscious and failed to examine the ways in which unconscious conflicts disrupt jurisprudential discourse not by hazard but according to particular structural regularities
5241754 frankly these recurrent ideas in jurisprudence are obsessions they are symptoms of a malaise symptoms of a failed attempt to contain or neutralise the anxiety of human experience what langland calls the inquietude juridique the three recurrent issues are symbolic of the three principals the mother father and child in the oedipal drama it is the symbolic that gives the world its meaning and its law and order lacan has shown us how the law is the being embodied in the name of the father and that the symbolic order exemplified by the name of the father is constituting society as l vi strauss shows this is the moment of the institution of the prohibition against incest what is interesting is that nowhere in the work does hart address the taboo against incest nor does he even where he discusses the minimum content of natural law attach true significance to human fecundity and the legal control of sexuality
5241755 for me it is always important to look back the elements that have led most theorists to abandon the concept of law are precisely those which intriqued me i approached the work concerned to show that harts anthropic imagery was symptoms of his anxiety it appears to me that this has been overlooked by most critical theorists and indeed gets no more than a brief mention in dworkins taking rights seriously in addition the development of jurisprudence requires us to consider the cutural products of the past at this moment legal philosophy in france is dominated by a concern to identify the processes through which the unconscious has revealed itself in theoretical texts and there is great uncertainty in the utility of paradigms that are not self referential this has acquired a profound importance because of the deep pessimism that has descended since les attentats of 9 11 the questions are more important now this is not qui veut gagner des millions
5241756 hart treated ideas merely as means of communication and consequently ignored the role and function of metonyme et metaphore in conceptualising law and legal systems language does not serve solely to convey thoughts and information the defective in communication is also important and if law were totally divorced from poetic processes then from where would the notion of obedience emerge du fond de la mer the unconscious is structured like a language and so too is law the law and the unconconscious are related in form and process and thus in its relation to the concept of law obedience is not merely an idea but a symbol for ideas which are essentially uncontainable by the signifier here hart is so wrong because the signified is never a simple idea
5241757 hart set out to provide answers to the three recurrent issues
5241758 in the second extract also from chapter 4 hart asserts for a group to have a habit it is enough that their behaviour in fact converges
5241759 what is interesting here is how hart ignores the distinction between the things to which a term refer its denotation and the meaning of the term its connotation hart continually blurs the distinction between extension and intension furthermore the passage reveals that hart never did not manage to abandon the faith in the achievement of objective human knowledge and his reliance upon reason his thesis is constructed out of artificially sharp dichotomies habits versus rules primary versus secondary legal versus pre legal what is more he set out to generalise experience and as a consequence the work fails to celebrate the intrinsic irony and particularity of language and social life
5241760 what is this context which sentences in a text are to contribute to context and which can be examined in themselves gestalt psychology tells us that what is context and what is relief is a question of intention all sentences are independent it is only when they escape from the page that we can understand their deep meaning there is no context out of which it is illegitimate to extract a sentence sentences like teeth can be removed from their surroundings and analysed as independent entitiies furthermore the unconscious is not revealed in a context but in a text any text freud showed how much can be understood about the unconscious from parapraxes i have attempted to show this same approach is fruitful when analysing works such as concept of law
5241761 human discourses occur in any number of discrete realms and as feyerabend and kuhn have shown rival theories are incommensurable if neither can be fully stated in the vocabulary of the other none is privileged to pass judgment on the success or value of any of the others that is sure je suis certaine
5241762 the search has proved futile like the gold at the end of the rainbow objective truth has eluded even the most committed of the traditionalists some found it unsupportable and dworkin avoided anxiety by redefining what he would accept as truth

5241795 youve got to be strong and know what youre doing as officials
5241796 i feel bitterly let down today because a sad day
5241797 if we had got the penalty we would have been in the ascendancy because they created nothing and didnt hurt us

5241801 i havent seen it again but my first impression was that it was a penalty
5241802 i had a look at the referee straight away and i thought it was definitely a penalty in my eyes
5241803 it would have been harsh on us because i thought we were by far the better team for most of the game

5241861 ich habe gemerkt dass sie uns untersch tzen als wir vor dem spiel im tunnel waren
5241862 das ist aber fantastisch vor dem spiel waren unsere chancen aufs weiterkommen bei 20 prozent nun liegen sie bei 50 prozent

5241882 i love germany and i love the n rburgring it was here in 2007 that we picked up our first one two of the season and weve gone and done the same again this time round todays result is a fantastic reward for the whole team theyre all delighted after finishing second and third at le mans it was important for peugeot to win this weekend and take the lead in both the manufacturers and drivers championships the title will finally be decided at silverstone we preferred to let our crews fight it out between themselves here because it was too early to start thinking in terms of strategy for the drivers title we took our decision out of respect for our drivers who all put in great performances again despite the traffic as well as for sporting reasons we didnt want to influence the outcome this is a great result not only for our brand but also for the psa group which scored two one two finishes in germany today with citro n taking first and second in the countrys round of the wrc
5241883 our race plan went perfectly we stayed with our incisive strategy of starting strongly in order to pull out a gap and we lapped our closest rivals at the halfway point so as not to lose the benefit of our hard work should the safety car come out the aerodynamic set up of the 2008 sprint spec 908 proved very competitive
5241884 i am proud of our performance for peugeot today it was very important to get both cars to the finish with a view to scoring championship points and after junes le mans 24 hours it was also important for st phane and me to get back onto the podium theres nothing like winning i am really delighted with this result because there were no team orders which goes to show what a sporting team peugeot is
5241885 its a fantastic result for us and for the whole team our car was perfectly balanced and the mechanics did a terrific job which enabled us to claim our second win of year following our victory at monza we had a good fight with the n 7 car and there was never much in it so nobody could afford to make a mistake
5241886 we lost a lot of time in the traffic especially behind the lola aston martin that cost us the lead and we then dropped a further 30 seconds to the n 8 car when we had a small problem with the starter probably because of a loose connection in the button
5241887 todays result is very positive for us in terms of the drivers championship it was nice to start from pole position and we also posted the fastest race lap the title decision will now go down to the wire at silverstone which is a circuit i love

5241893 but taking a break takes the pressure off and encourages non sexual intimacy which in turn makes you both feel more easily aroused because youre relaxed
5241894 a deficiency of zinc can impact on your bodys production of testosterone making you feel unenthusiastic
5241895 so rather than peeling off all your clothes before having sex in the bedroom try some heavy petting with your clothes on in the kitchen the hallway or even the garden shed
5241896 it might feel daft at first when you could just go to the bedroom but changing the location of where you get aroused can trigger new desires and emotions
5241897 being amped up by a high powered high stress job is more likely to make you more sexually active than idling in a cushy low key career
5241898 there were six separate dining halls for the servants depending on your place in the hierarchy
5241899 the stewards room was the top dining room reserved for the upper ten it was terribly smart they sat on chippendale chairs

5241901 david left the club on friday he told us that he cannot work with owen or under anybody for that matter but as a club we are standing by with what we have done because owens appointment was relevant

5241913 the small patch of moist forest is surrounded by caatinga dry shrubland and thorn forest
5241914 around one million people depend on the forest for their water supply but the moist forest is shrinking every day because of fires the spread of agriculture and the development of leisure homes for people who want to escape the hot dry climate people have not yet realised that their quality of life and economic activities such as agriculture depend on the preservation of the forest they think water comes from the water company
5241915 we have no right to exterminate the species that evolved without us we have the responsibility to do everything we can to preserve their continued existence
5241916 we believe that the water issue will ultimately save the araripe manakin if we can convince the one million city dwellers that their water supply will be guaranteed if they preserve the moist forest

5241926 zum nachteil der verbraucherinnen wurde unser antrag betreffend r cktrittsrechte von den koalitionsparteien immer wieder vertagt wir werden aber nicht locker lassen und ihn in der n chsten gesetzgebungsperiode erneut einbringen
5241927 gerade dieser fall zeigt aber auch wie wichtig die t tigkeit des vki f r die rechte der konsumentinnen ist
5241928 so lange effiziente rechtsschutzinstrumente wie beispielsweise die gruppenklage weiter auf sich warten lassen ist es wichtig dass dem vki weiterhin gen gend mittel und ressourcen f r die prozessf hrung im dienste der konsumentinnen zur verf gung gestellt werden
5241929 somethings been rattling around my head for the past few days and its only forming slowly like a memory in the mist something someone said it was exactly the same wording used in regard to another bishop not so long ago i need to do some hunting but lets increase our prayers for bishop roche lets not let our hostility to his actions make us think any less of the poor man under the mitre

5241933 die in der begutachtungsfrist eingegangenen stellungnahmen sind niederschmetternd eine neuerliche inhaltliche auseinandersetzung ist unabdingbar

5241953 if we took hex chrome off all those workers wouldnt have to worry about respiratory programs and the potential for cancer in the future
5241954 so we saw a huge benefit to doing it but we also had to manage the risk very carefully
5241955 we had to come up with a system that had at least as good if not better corrosion resistance on the parts
5241956 and more difficult we had to convince our engineers of that so we could get hex chrome out of the work environment
5241957 ive come to understand that the hierarchy of controls saves money
5241958 the best cost benefit comes from elimination or substitution of the hazardous product
5241959 if you add all that up verses the investment we made in engineering its always cheaper to engineer it out than put an engineering control in place
5241960 you do it for ethical reasons you do it because its the right thing to do
5241961 but if you can demonstrate to management that the right thing to do is also the smart thing to do financially it gets things done very quickly
5241962 that will help us in the summer because big parts of the plant arent air conditioned
5241963 because that energy is generated so efficiently the simple payback period is a little over 3 years
5241964 sikorsky is on what we call the glide path to get those numbers
5241965 were seeing a huge return on investment not to mention that this is the right thing to do which is to fix the most dangerous jobs first

5241972 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5241973 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5241974 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5241975 the way were swinging the bats you never feel out of the game no matter what the score
5241976 when we got ichiro up there in the ninth inning in that situation i thought you know we might pull this out
5241977 because when i go to the court and the other players know i beat 19 players in a row and nobody can beat me it is good for me
5241978 but the important points i played very good that was the difference
5241979 im pretty sad that maybe i couldnt give 100 percent today
5241980 its pretty sore too tight and i feel it when i move or serve or get ready for a return
5241981 basically i just want to come in and help the offensive line any way i can
5241982 i want to be the guy we can depend on and just continue to work hard and practice hard
5241983 he seemed very upbeat about the situation you never want to see somebody get hurt but he said he was just going to take a little time off
5241984 right now they have me working at right tackle primarily and i feel comfortable there but whatever the team needs me to do i can do
5241985 i wanted to make the perfect coney island experience something that captivates thats an immediate visceral reaction and that lingers in the memory
5241986 sometimes the absurd is a way to shock people out of thier daily routeine and get them to thnk about things in a fresh way or get them pay attention
5241987 wenn man davon ausgeht dass ltere mitarbeiter l ngere krankst nde aufweisen als junge kann der ffentliche dienst hier absolut mithalten mit der privatwirtschaft
5241988 es gibt statistisch gesehen auch keinen blauen montag im ffentlichen dienst
5241989 die krankenstandstage bewegen sich nicht rund um den montag und freitag sondern sind gleichm ig verteilt
5241990 umso h her die qualifikation umso niedriger sind die krankenst nde
5241991 ich glaube aber auch dass die reformen unter schwarz blau nicht zur motivation der polizistinnen beigetragen haben
5241992 es muss das ziel eines vorgesetzten sein dass die mitarbeiterinnen gesund sind denn nur dann bringen sie volle leistung und fehlen nicht
5241993 einen weiteren schritt zur vergleichbarkeit mit der privatwirtschaft zu schaffen

5241999 you have to pick a board thats open to guest views
5242000 i think the big problem is yahoo doesnt know what it wants to be when it grows up
5242001 its difficult to talk about mergers and acquisitions when you dont have a clear vision and i dont think yahoo has a clear vision right now
5242002 yahoo has none of those things and as long as thats the case theyre going to continue floundering theyre going to flounder if theyre talking about mergers and acquisitions and theyre going to flounder if theyre talking about management and continued operations of the company
5242003 those two guys represent a toe in the water in both the and subscription revenue worlds where yahoo is underperforming
5242004 if i were them id be pushing very actively on the agenda of what are we going to do to push from an underperformer to an overperformer in both of those segments what are you doing to build critical mass and share in those against google and the established 300 spartans on the telephony side
5242005 this is step two out of 10 not step eight out of eight
5242006 the more time they lose in these proxy battles and these pseudo proxy battles theyre giving google more time giving traditional telephony cellulars more time to respond
5242007 from a strategy perspective you want to keep any option open as long as theres not a compelling reason to close it
5242008 in this case theres no reason they should give up on the merger and acquisition front but as theyre doing that they should also try to come up with a clear and consistent plan
5242009 i think theyre going to have to do this on their own
5242010 i think looking for somebody to parachute in and buy the company really becomes the long shot and now its really taking yahoo back to whatever it is it wants to do when it grows up again
5242011 finding a company thats going to buy a property as expensive as yahoo particularly given the public nature of what happened during the microsoft thing is going to be tough in this market where everybodys watching their cash real closely its going to be double hard
5242012 has agreed to pay up to 30 million to settle federal trade commission charges that it did not have adequate evidence to support its advertising claims in which its effervescent tablet was marketed as a cold prevention and treatment remedy
5242013 to avoid continued expense and distraction from management of the business

5242021 what we believe hoffe must have is the diary he kept from the day he arrived in tel aviv in 1939 filled with observations for researchers it would be very significant
5242022 brod became a zionist before the first world war lived and worked here and is buried here less well known is the fact that kafka was a totally engaged jewish personality and writer with many intimate connections to zionism and jews

5242040 i wouldnt be alive today but for the personal courage of john mccain
5242041 it was long ago and far away in a prison camp in north vietnam my father was a high ranking admiral the vietnamese came and said that i could leave prison early and we had a code of conduct that said you only leave by order of capture i also had a dear and beloved friend who was from california by the name of ed alvarez who had been shot down and captured a couple years before me but i wasnt in good physical shape in fact i was in rather bad physical shape
5242042 so i said no now in interest of full disclosure im very happy i didnt know the war was going to last for another three years or so but i said no and ill never forget the high ranking officer who offered it slammed the door and the interrogator said go back to your cell its going to be very tough on you now and it was but it was not only the toughest decision i ever made but im most happy about that decision than any decision ive ever made in my life it took a lot of prayer it took a lot of prayer
5242043 i think that rich is should be defined by a home a good job and education and the ability to hand to our children a more prosperous and safer world than the one that we inherited
5242044 well i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5242045 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies thats my commitment thats my commitment to you
5242046 i think my faith is strong enough and my marriage is strong enough that i can afford those civil rights to others even if i have a different perspectiveor a different view

5242052 i believe that a foreigner has to be better than the local players and he has to prove his qualities to the coach

5242055 if you guys are going to run stuff and run every lie under the sun have somebody stand up for somebody
5242056 have me as a man who ended a relationship stand here and write some truth have me stand up for somebody and write that jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated person i think ive ever met
5242057 shes one of the most lovely people ive ever met in my life and im going through something thats a very personal thing and you have to give that up
5242058 you have to give everything up because you cant have it all and it sucks
5242059 but its about time that somebody stands up for that girl and i think shes great
5242060 the most normal thing in the world theres no lying theres no cheating theres no nothing
5242061 people are different they have different chemistry they have different lives
5242062 its not about years its about going out with somebody being truthful on the way in being truthful in the middle and being truthful on the way out
5242063 why are you asking me that question im being as honest as i can possibly can be
5242064 i ended a relationship because there is no lying i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right i dont waste peoples time
5242065 i guarantee you that 20 percent of the people on this street right now who are in a relationship wish they could get out but they dont know how and im going to be honest on the way in to my relationships and im going to be honest on the way out of my relationships
5242066 i just feel like spending a million dollars right now to put a mirror in every us weekly so that when youre reading about it you go oh that was me two years ago or that was me a year ago
5242067 and im not the first im the second one and thats it theres no lying theres no b llsh t i just dont want to be followed around new york city like an animal

5242080 it is extremely difficult to hunt so many walruses on ice and it would be strange to bring the bodies to the shore
5242081 it is clear that border guards found remains of walruses that died last autumn
5242082 most probably the animals died during long swimming through rough ice free sea from drifting ice to the mainland coast
5242083 he suits the profile of the type of player we want to bring to the club premier league experience but young enough to improve
5242084 we think hell get great confidence from being a regular player as was the case when jeremie aliadiere was at arsenal he was in the team one week and then out the next so it was very hard to gain confidence hes a super athlete hes technically good and from the feedback weve had hes a smashing kid to work with so were very much looking forward to bringing him to our team
5242085 its tough because i was an arsenal supporter but you have to make decisions in football and this is a new chapter in my career
5242086 i was a london boy hopefully ill be a north east boy now
5242087 its a chance to go out and show i can play and hopefully play every week and keep up my consistency
5242088 long term i want to take this club into the champions league that will take time but we have that vision
5242089 were not putting a time scale on anything were thinking long term we want to recruit young players our targets wont change because weve won one game
5242090 its only the way we can survive financially we cant compete for the top players what we can do is give youngsters an opportunity
5242091 i think i played their in my first game for the under 17s but not since
5242092 but ill play anywhere even left back they play more in a triangle in the middle i was happy about that
5242093 you have to get stuck into the likes of modric and giovanni players new to the premier league thats exactly what we did
5242094 we felt that experience would be important for us all over the field we knew he would give us height at set pieces
5242095 hes progressing very well for a young player hes extremely ambitious he wants to work at his game he wants to learn his book of knowledge is wide open
5242096 i think tactically the gaffer has done well he closed down the middle and asked the wide players stewart downing and jeremie aliadiere to tuck in and close up the midfield
5242097 they were quite narrow and we knew bentley and giovanni like to tuck in they all wanted to play through the middle so the gaffer knew that before the game and knew exactly what they were doing
5242098 we can discuss this but it has to be market oriented any restriction to energy markets makes things more expensive for customers
5242099 there is no fear of a nuclear bomb coming out of this region but the bigger danger is that a small amount of uranium combined with conventional explosive terrorists could make a dirty bomb that would make an area the size of the citys square mile unusable for 30 or 40 years
5242100 my father was out of work so i was eligible i was single and i was out of school and all and unemployed
5242101 it was good physical work good hard work but we were well fed and well cared for

5242103 at the time during the depression it was tough and my father was working for a company in waterbury and he was only working a couple days a week
5242104 so we needed food on the table there were seven of us besides mother and father nine people ate a lot of food
5242105 they need it today it would be wonderful today if they had it and got the kids off the street and into a camp like that work hard and earn money and learn what life is all about

5242112 once we get a little heating going well start to see scattered showers and thunderstorms develop and they should become numerous by early afternoon
5242113 the main threat will be gusty winds and heavy rains and we could have some street flooding where the heavy rain occurs
5242114 were expecting rainy conditions through wednesday with a gradual improvement starting thursday and continuing on into the weekend
5242115 ayah nenek dulu pernah bercerita kepadaku bahwa kakek dan nenek waktu masih muda sangat miskin tidak punya uang sehingga tidak bisa terus menyekolahkan ayah
5242116 memang begitulah keadaannya nak mengapa kau tanyakan hal itu anakku
5242117 aku membayangkan saja ngeri yah lantas apakah ayah pernah menyesali masa lalu yang serba kekurangan sekolah rendah dan susah begitu
5242118 tidak nak ayah tidak pernah menyesalinya dan tidak akan mau menukar dengan apa pun masa lalu itu bahkan ayah mensyukurinya karena kalau tidak ada penderitaan seperti itu mungkin ayah tidak akan punya semangat untuk belajar dan bekerja berjuang dan belajar lagi hingga bisa berhasil seperti saat ini
5242119 lho kata ayah tadi penderitaan masa lalu yang serba susahlah yang membuat ayah berhasil padahal aku dilahirkan dalam keluarga mampu kan ayahku orang sukses
5242120 ayah tidak sekolah tinggi sedangkan ayah menyuruhku kalau bisa sekolah sampai s2 dan menguasai 3 bahasa inggris mandarin dan it kalau aku ingin sukses seperti ayah kan nggak bisa dong kan aku nggak susah seperti ayah dulu
5242121 hahaha memang kamu mau jadi anak orang miskin dan jualan kue
5242122 yaaaah kan udah nggak bisa memilih tapi kayaknya kalau bisa memilih pun aku memilih seperti sekarang saja deh enak sih punya papa mama baik dan mampu seperti papa mamaku hehehe
5242123 karena itulah kamu harus bersyukur tidak perlu susah seperti ayah dulu yang jelas siapa orangtua kita dan bagaimana keadaan masa lalu itu kaya atau miskin kita tidak bisa memilih ya kan maka ayah tidak pernah menyesali masa lalu malah bersyukur pada masa lalu yang penuh dengan penderitaan dari sana ayah belajar hanya penderitaan hidup yang dapat mengajarkan pada manusia akan arti keindahan dan nilai kehidupan yang jelas di kehidupan ini ada hukum perubahan yang berlaku kita bisa merubah keadaan jika kita mau belajar berusaha dan berjuang habis habisan tuhan memberi kita segala kemampuan itu gunakan sebaik baiknya dimulai dari keadaan kita saat ini entah miskin atau kaya niscaya semua usaha kita diberkati dan kamu pun bisa sukses melebihi ayah saat ini ingat teruslah berdoa serta berusaha belajar dan bekerjalah lebih keras dan giat maka cita citamu akan tercapai

5242126 we havent delivered at this level of consistency across some of the sports which i would call the formula one sports for many many generations
5242127 the whole country has been watching and has been thrilled by team gb we are immensely proud of what they have achieved so far and inspired by their performance our olympians talent and dedication represent the very best of britain
5242128 thats all in the past mate im an olympic champion now
5242129 i can tell everybody that it is worth it all the pain and the hardship and worrying if you are as good as you think you are
5242130 some people dont want to win gold they need to it seems that we have a lot of those at these olympics
5242131 you can work for 10 years you can have terrible days but you always are carried on by the idea that one day you will be a winner and that it will all be worthwhile now i can tell you something else one thing you can never imagine is how great it feels to win i thought i knew precisely how it would feel but i didnt i only found out when i had given everything i had and realised that it was enough
5242132 hey i want to order pizza but we shouldnt waste the money
5242133 no problem ill just chacha while you order and go pick it up
5242134 harbour suspicions of their neighbours intentions and nurture their own national dreams about deep sea riches north of 70
5242135 you dont defend national sovereignty with flags cheap election rhetoric and advertising campaigns
5242136 you need forces on the ground ships in the sea and proper surveillance
5242137 the promise of co operation and dialogue with northerners which seemed to frame government plans in the 1990s has been jettisoned in favour of a call to arms to stand up for canada
5242138 the time for canadian action in the north has indeed come but it need not be justified by partisan rhetoric rooted in alarmism even paranoia
5242139 integrated northern strategy focused on strengthening canadas sovereignty protecting our environmental heritage promoting economic and social development and improving and devolving governance so that northerners have greater control over their destinies
5242140 youd have to go back to diefenbaker to find a prime minister as personally focused on issues in the north
5242141 the problem is that the actual lead has been taken by the prime ministers office and has been driven primarily for electoral reasons with the department of national defence muscling in on some of the larger infrastructure funding that has been made available i dont fault dnd for that but as a result some of the smaller departments havent been given as significant a voice
5242142 the international leaders forum gives political leaders from around the world a unique opportunity to observe american democracy first hand while hearing from a wide range of experts from the us and abroad
5242143 our goal is to highlight the best of our democratic tradition provide our guests with a better understanding of americas political process and encourage dynamic discussion about the future of democracy across the globe
5242144 its always nice to score three goals and the whole team contributed to them and to the win hopefully we can go the next step and win again on tuesday night
5242145 im obviously delighted with the result and it is fantastic to opening the season with a win we always knew we would have to work very hard to get something from this fixture but the squad know that there are many things we can improve on we now have two home games in the space of a few days which we need to take the confidence that we have gained from today into those matches
5242146 not getting it up and down on 11 kind of ticked me off
5242147 i kind of told myself im letting the tournament get away from me again that was where the tournament was won for me

5242149 well shes sleeping cant be woken but nobody knows why theyve run a battery of tests still waiting results but on the face of it they havent got a clue
5242150 what are we going to do about your tea love
5242151 i think i can still find my way around these corridors ive spent enough time here over the years
5242152 jack maggs called hamish and filled him in we came over as soon as we heard
5242153 im surprised the jungle drums took so long to get the story out
5242154 we were out excommunicado jack left a message on hamishs machine
5242155 so youve been staying with hamish this past fortnight have you
5242156 im sorry i didnt get in touch sooner i felt like i needed a retreat after the brawl in the pub
5242157 it makes perfect sense to me anyway what matters is fiona
5242158 she just i dont know collapsed during the meeting i mean she couldnt go on i took her up and put her to bed
5242159 then we called dr roebuck he organised an ambulance someone called cynthia
5242160 i rode in with her i mean lydia and i rode in
5242161 ill just go find hamish and lydia i think do you want something a cup of tea maybe
5242162 is there a cafeteria or somewhere to get a cup of tea nearby
5242163 down the corridor first left down a flight then follow the signs
5242164 lydia was just saying how morag had been there when she came home and pretty much took care of the whole thing until cynthia met them at the hospital
5242165 i mean they say theres nothing wrong she just wont wake up they say its a non a non trauma coma
5242166 like lydia said shes shut down for no apparent reason all they can do is run tests and wait
5242167 they said we could talk to her if we like she might be able to hear us
5242168 but we didnt we couldnt think of anything to say
5242169 maybe if we talked to her more maybe shed wake up
5242170 what now what do the doctors recommend does she stay here or can she be looked after at home
5242171 i expect theyll want to keep her in for a while at least
5242172 i doubt this will last i mean theres not anything wrong with her right so theres no reason to think she wont wake up soon
5242173 yes of course its probably just like exhaustion or something
5242174 us oldies ken we come down with these mysterious illnesses from time to time its only age you just have to accept you cant keep up the pace your nan isnt the kind of person to slow down voluntarily so her body has said enough is enough and taken a wee holiday
5242175 but old folks dont go dropping into comas all the time do they no its more than that something must have happened
5242176 despu s de ello boston ya est corrido y es parte de su leyenda

5242179 i dont know why he got shot i dont know why he went up there i just saw him drop to the ground
5242180 clearly over the course of the last 24 hours this crisis has escalated
5242181 the brzezinski faction gears up for the global showdown with moscow
5242182 another of zbigniews sons is ian brzezinski currently the us deputy assistant secretary of state for european and nato affairs and a backer of nato expansion into ukraine and georgia this project means that americans will be committed to fight and die for a gangster regime in the caucasus at the far end of the black sea
5242183 the epicenter of world confrontation is rapidly shifting out of the middle east and towards eastern europe and everywhere else along the borders of the russian federation
5242184 hysterical agitation against the serbs in kosovo the chinese in tibet and sinkiang the russians in the caucasus
5242185 ian brzezinski another son of zbigniew is busy poisoning us relations with russia from his post as deputy assistant secretary of defense for europe and russia in the bush pentagon
5242186 with us missiles about to be installed in poland under the direct supervision of ian brzezinski the pentagons top man for eastern europe the world is demonstrably moving towards a us russian superpower confrontation with unmistakable thermonuclear overtones
5242187 the initial thrust of the obama campaign was the attempt to achieve nomination by acclamation through a surprise people power coup or color revolution employing the same repertoire of techniques which the cia the national endowment for democracy ned the soros foundations the brzezinski clique and gene sharps albert einstein institution have carried out recently in such places as belgrade serbia tiflis georgia and kiev ukraine something similar is afoot in tibet and in the rest of china
5242188 judging by opinion polls american voters see obama as the better candidate on most positions the economy and healthcare the biggest campaign issues education migration problems and so on there is only one issue on which mccain is substantially ahead of obama 55 to 24 the question of who would make a better commander in chief for the us armed forces he is a former officer a vietnam war hero and the son and grandson of us navy admirals
5242189 everyone has been asking why the war started on the first day of the olympic games theres a simple explanation for that the order to start the war didnt come from saakashvili whose attitude to china is neutral or positive it came from cheney and the neo cons who hate china thus they also disrupted the medias celebration of the beijing olympics
5242190 perhaps when russia even begins to match your tremendous feats of glory can you speak about pulling back you fool of the worst kind
5242191 the games in 2012 is going to be an amazing opportunity and has always been my main target not this olympics because im only 19
5242192 my main focus will still be the swimming i wont accept anything that gets in the way of that at all if speedo or any brand are interested id love to have a kit deal because buying costumes goggles hats it gets quite expensive just for one pair of goggles its 25 you dont expect them to be that much its just a bit of plastic youre in the pool four hours a day so you go through a training costume every month they go see through or big theyre around 30
5242193 the heats were so hard and so fast that it was difficult to race hard again within 36 hours
5242194 i would have liked to have gone quicker but now ive got to concentrate on getting recovered again so im ready for the 10km
5242195 i said come on then lets go one better she didnt really react by that stage she was totally focused on the job i could have told her that her hair was on fire and she would have just sat there
5242196 im gutted for the crew truly gutted they deserved to win it did spur me on a little bit but at that point i was in the zone only concerned about my own performance
5242197 i was shouting to shane sutton britains chief coach was it me was it me when he said id won i still didnt believe it
5242198 to become olympic champion puts you on a different level to everyone else
5242199 when youre one of the best athletes in your country you feel great but when you come here youre mixing it with thousands of the best athletes in the world and youre nothing until you become olympic champion
5242200 i couldnt put myself through that stress again im happy with my lot besides i was never good at any sports i dont think im that good at riding a bike its just hard work and determination that has got me here at least ill be able to relax now i didnt want to carry on for another four years fighting and fighting for that one step further now ill just see what limits i can push myself to as a bike rider to see if i can be like bradley wiggins or chris hoy that would be the ultimate
5242201 dan has been with me from the beginning and has got me through the toughest times
5242202 i definitely wouldnt be in this position if it wasnt for him the thing i was most gutted about was not being able to share the experience with him at the very last hurdle
5242203 im going to be in a position where all the other athletes have medalled
5242204 my motivation will be to make sure that im not the loser in the team

5242206 its hard to believe all wins all records it was a dream that ive always lived for

5242212 in a way i think its storytelling at its most primal form
5242213 i believe in both print publishing and bookstores and i always have
5242214 but i also believe that obscurity is one of the hardest things for young artists to avoid by using a variety of online distribution tools as well as more traditional print publishing im hoping more people will get to know both myself and my work i believe that this helps build a platform for my continued development as an artist and helps grow my audience at the same time im also very pleased to see that the book is already available through a number of channels notably online at both amazon and barnes amp noble

5242271 freedom and life can be taken from us but not honour

5242273 im telling you all im going even if they tear me into pieces over there
5242274 every one of us who as political correspondent or politician was forced into decisions we later regretted made stupid mistakes this rationale is far too weak when it comes to explaining having approved this law the word later also doesnt reach the heart of the matter because i knew back then that this vote of yes could never be expunged from the story of my life
5242275 the depoliticisation of the once thoroughly liberal minded bourgeoisie the catastrophic heritage of bismarck the segregation of the universities the institution of the reserve officers the caste methods within the civil service the turning of the bourgeoisie to pure moneymaking and the political disengagement of intellectuals from everyday life this catastrophic attitude of the german middle classes was fed on many levels making them the middle classes susceptible to apolitical emotional excitements in turn making the victory of fascism possible by the absorption of virtually all the bourgeois electoral masses
5242276 in my opinion the german people as well as the bishops and clergy bear the blame for their predecessors in the concentration camps it is true that later there was possibly nothing more that could be done the blame lies earlier the german people as well as in large part bishops and clergy were responsive to the national socialist agitation they aligned themselves with the national socialists almost without resistance even sometimes with enthusiasm therein lies the guilt
5242277 the whole national socialist agitation is a persistent appeal to the inner swine of man
5242278 the german people will need decades to morally and intellectually recover from the wounds inflicted by this kind of agitation
5242279 human dignity shall be inviolable to respect and protect it shall be the duty of all state authority the german people therefore acknowledge inviolable and inalienable human rights as the basis of every community of peace and of justice in the world

5242305 its inevitable that the controversy that surrounded him has played a role in his performances on the pitch

5242322 no if i felt i was really doing damage i would have stopped but it is horrible when you have to drop out especially when it is the olympic games so many people have worked hard to get me here and in some ways it is quicker to keep going because you are just left out there on your own if you stop somewhere
5242323 its like when youre chasing a beautiful woman and you slap on the cologne and for a short while it is the most important thing before a big fight everyone just wants to know the answer to one question whos gonna win whos gonna win and then you move on to something else when you know the answer

5242386 this is my dream job i have always wanted to be an action hero and hope to be able to use my gymnastic ability to perform all of laras stunts
5242387 i could maybe go 9 60 the way i looked

5242406 im absolutely delighted with the quality of the additional staff we have appointed to the national management team and to the scottish rugby coaching group
5242407 to secure the services of the ex all blacks captain mike brewer is a boost he is now a very experienced coach having worked in club rugby in ireland england and italy before becoming forwards coach for leinster
5242408 anyone who knows rugby will have been impressed by the progress leinster the reigning magners league champions have made up front during his three years in that role
5242409 graham steadman is among the most experienced defence coaches in the world having now spent five years in that position in rugby union with firstly munster and then ireland that followed his 21 year career as an international player and coach in rugby league
5242410 im looking forward to working with frank and the other coaches scotland have a young team with a great work ethic and players who are very keen to learn
5242411 i think they have the potential to develop into a really good international side in the next three to four years
5242412 i have been an admirer of scotland and the work that alan tait has undertaken in the last few seasons
5242413 i look forward to being part of franks coaching team and to getting the players trust and buy in to the defensive systems ill look to put in place
5242414 let me repeat liu xiang will not withdraw unless the pain is unbearable

5242418 after liu xiangs injury i wont bother coming back to the birds nest for more
5242419 and will encourage him to come back to the track
5242420 i think they will be disappointed but they will understand

5242422 brahman akan mengambil kekayaan mereka yang suka memeras bawahan dan orang orang di sekitarnya demikian pula mereka yang tidak membagikan kekayaannya kepada pekerja pekerja yang ulet membanting tulang
5242423 kami akan menyucikan semua yang kembali ke hindu dengan memercikkan gangga theertha air gangga dan sethu theertha air sethu
5242424 saya menanyakan pada uskup katolik untuk mengambil langkah langkah perbaikan tetapi tidak ada yang dapat menghentikan perlawanan umat kristen dalit ini adalah hasil dari beberapa perubahan perubahan
5242425 ada beberapa kemiripan dalam sebuah kasta didasarkan pada dugaan di dalam hubungan antara kekristenan adalah sebuah tanda balasan atas kemurnian solidaritas kemanusiaan sebuah ancaman kemurnian spiritual dan sebuah gangguan serius bagi misi gereja gereja injili
5242426 oleh karena itu kebiasaan atau tradisi yang mengabadikan atau menguatkan kembali pemisahan kasta sebaiknya lebih lagi disusun sehingga dapat mengekspresikan suatu solidaritas bagi seluruh komunitas kristen
5242427 ini adalah situasi yang patut disayangkan saya tidak ingin mengomentari hal ini
5242428 raja menghargai setiap bentuk kepercayaan agama tidak memberi keistimewaan terhadap satu
5242429 sebelumnya saya islam bahkan belajar di pondok pesantren tebu ireng menjadi taat dan fanatik pada islam
5242430 menginjak usia remaja saya sering bermimpi di malam hari kedatangan orang tua berpakaian serba putih
5242431 le ndilalah karsa gusti mbesuk kowe tapa padha ngajarake piwulang adi
5242432 setelah membaca kitab kitab suci hindu maka romo mangku tentu mempunyai bandingan dengan isi quran bagaimana pendapat romo mangku
5242433 wah banyak pengetahuan baru yang saya tidak dapatkan di quran
5242434 menjadi hindu saya merasa aman tentram selalu merasa puas dengan keadaan tidak pernah punya pikiran untuk hidup berlebih lebihan di luar batas kemampuan memandang manusia mahluk lain dan alam semesta seolah olah memandang diri sendiri timbul rasa kasih sayang ingin bersama sama memuja kebesaran tuhan saya berhasil membina keluarga dengan baik bahkan hewan hewan peliharaan merupakan bagian dari keluarga kami pohon pohon kami sayangi dan pelihara
5242435 saya benar benar merasa bahwa agama hindu telah menuntun saya menjadi manusia yang berguna dan bertanggung jawab memelihara keharmonisan kehidupan di dunia
5242436 karena itu kepada anak anak muda saya selalu menekankan untuk mempelajari kitab kitab suci hindu dengan baik sesuatu yang baik dan indah tidak perlu dicari ke mana mana semua ada dalam pustaka warisan leluhur kita sejak dahulu
5242437 kalau paat di bali itu artinya pahat alat tukang kayu untuk membuat takikan
5242438 romo saya sudah lama ingin memberikan ini pada romo tapi baru kali ini sempat ketemu
5242439 wah terima kasih banyak atas jerih payahnya dan ketulusan hati mas paat memberikan kepada saya nanti di bali akan saya suruh membentuk jadi tongkat dengan pegangannya berbentuk kepala bebek
5242440 ya saya hanya mengingatkan jangan sampai ada umat hindu yang mencuri kayu di hutan larangan
5242441 saya tertarik dengan istilah spanyol itu mas paat betul seperti apa yang dikatakan oleh romo mangku bero jangan sampai ada umat hindu di sini yang tega merusak hutan dengan menebanginya selain melanggar hukum juga melanggar dharma karena melakukan pencurian dan pembunuhan atau mematikan pohon bila pohon ditebangi semena mena dan hutan digunduli malapetaka bagi umat manusia pasti akan tiba berupa bencana alam kalau kita merusak atau menyakiti alam maka alam pun akan menyakiti bahkan memusnahkan manusia hubungan antara manusia binatang dan hutan seperti yang diuraikan dalam kitab suci arjuna wiwaha dimisalkan sebagai sebuah hutan yang lebat dihuni harimau manusia hidup di luar hutan sebagai petani hutan menjadi angker karena harimau menjaganya dan harimau juga hidup dari hutan yang banyak dihuni oleh binatang kecil lainnya seperti kancil dan manjangan manusia mendapatkan air untuk kehidupannya juga dari hutan karena adanya sumber mata air yang mengalir ke tanah tanah pertanian
5242442 apabila keharmonisan ini terganggu karena manusia nekat masuk hutan dan menebangi pohon maka hutan kehilangan angkernya harimau dibinasakan hutan semakin gundul dan akhirnya hutan berubah menjadi tanah gersang yang tidak lagi menghasilkan air bagi kehidupan manusia itulah tanda dunia menuju kiamat kehidupan musnah karena ulah manusia seperti yang saya sampaikan tadi salah satu wujud bhakti kita kepada hyang widhi adalah dengan menjaga trihitakarana tiga hal yang membawa kebaikan yaitu parhyangan hubungan manusia dengan tuhan pawongan hubungan manusia dengan sesama manusia dan palemahan hubungan manusia dengan alam semesta jadi bila salah satu dari ketiga hubungan itu terganggu atau rusak maka menyebabkan malapetaka bagi umat manusia karena keharmonisan sentralnya ada pada manusia penebangan hutan adalah salah satu contoh yang buruk bagi rusaknya hubungan manusia dengan alam semesta maka merusak trihitakarana dapat dikatakan sebagai perbuatan dosa

5242446 president bush arrived in beijing today i dont think he really gets the olympics when they asked him if he liked the decathlon he said that he prefers regular coffee
5242447 beijing skies are so polluted that chinese authorities are planning emergency measures for the olympics for example protesters will now only be run over with hybrid tanks
5242448 president bush is going to make history he will become the first sitting u s president to attend the olympics in a foreign country he said hes been looking forward to it ever since he heard that in china people are not allowed to make fun of political leaders
5242449 well this is a fine predicament i find myself in
5242450 i have no idea what number post i am on anymore sadly current events
5242451 its exciting when youve been inside a publisher for six years and we havent been really shopping for projects or investigating our network to see whats out there
5242452 its a very exciting world that suddenly opens up if things work out this could well be a really really interesting and positive move for massive
5242453 i mean i remember trying to find publisher deals and it was just so incredibly hard that youd kill yourself
5242454 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5242455 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5242456 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5242457 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5242458 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5242459 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5242460 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5242461 yougov asked 541 single brits how far they agreed with the following statement if i like someone on a first date i would rather end the date with a nice cup of tea coffee or other warm drink than by spending the night with them
5242462 luckily i was in the stairway when the explosion hit but they didnt make it
5242463 when you send one message to twitter and we send it to ten followers you arent charged ten times thats because weve been footing the bill
5242464 we took a risk hoping to bring more nations onboard and more mobile operators around to our way of thinking but weve arrived at a point where the responsible thing to do is slow our costs and take a different approach
5242465 i hear the rhythms and melodies of everyday life and try to translate them into my production taking it to an intensity of deep dark melodic pounding driving bass however i interpret a feeling at that given moment

5242494 ive only ever heard it sung live by two women brigitte fassbaender and sarah walker but i took time to relate to it because so much is written in a masculine emotional framework
5242495 that the lover often doesnt realise hes upset hes so emotionally unaware by contrast im very much in touch with my feelings
5242496 because its so truthful and because it mirrors mankinds relationship with the landscape i feel so hemmed in by a world of plastic metal and concrete so i find it liberating to immerse myself in that poetry
5242497 my main problem is a danger of crying as i sing it im certainly in the right place emotionally im 39 and single i had a passionate relationship for seven years which i realised was going nowhere god im painting a picture of gloom why dont i just slit my wrists on this table edge
5242498 my father an artist used to play it on 78s hans hotter singing while he worked in his studio just hearing this sound with my father silhouetted against the window went straight to my core and has stayed there ever since
5242499 at 14 i was singing along with kathleen ferrier records at 17 i saw jessye norman at the proms and i knew what i wanted to be
5242500 i was so homesick hated london and was staying in a hall of residence where people would pour beer under my door i was this little bumpkin from cheshire who couldnt cope with the social pressure im not sure i can cope now

5242503 a teacher once said to me youll have to give up everything if you take up singing you wont have boyfriends or any sort of life only now do i realise how true those words are
5242504 you would have to be a psycho path to thrive in the environment an opera singer exists in you are cut off from everyone you love you are plunged in with people you may not get on with and you can be very demoralised particularly nowadays when youre asked to do things you dont agree with
5242505 meaning that we singers arent trusted one lovely thing about doing
5242506 and because theres less money about you are pushed to work more and more ive read so much press criticism about singers cancelling and being greedy i dont agree fear is what drives everything in music now everyone is galvanised by a fear of whether theyll be around tomorrow theres a fixation on youth and newness so you grab the work while you can i find it depressing
5242507 i dont think i cancel more than others i worked without a holiday for eight years exhaustion was one factor then i went through a horrendous experience during orlando at covent garden in 2003 she dropped out halfway through the run just before that i had taken steroids to get through a prom so i was working on vocal cords that were much too swollen i then went straight into covent garden rehearsals i felt as if i was having to drive my throat like a jcb to recover from that was a three year journey of hell and there was such pressure on me not only to keep going but to keep quiet about my problems

5242533 that parody was the reason i won the grammy because it made the record so big it was undeniable
5242534 it is the fault therefore of the instruments which god does not allow to be idle that evil things are done with god himself setting them in motion
5242535 all this is settled and certain if we believe that god is omnipotent and also that the ungodly is a creature of god although as one averse from god and left to himself without the spirit of god he cannot will or do good the omnipotence of god makes it impossible for the ungodly to evade the motion and action of god for he is necessarily subject to it and obeys it but his corruption or aversion from god makes it impossible for him to be moved and carried along with good effect god cannot lay aside his omnipotence on account of mans aversion and ungodly man cannot alter his aversion it thus comes about that man perpetually and necessarily sins and errs until he is put right by the spirit of god

5242552 this is a standard response by management in labour negotiations
5242553 they hope this threat will stampede our membership to take a bad deal
5242554 the risk that actors may not receive increases retroactively is more than offset by the long term damage that would result from a premature deal that eliminates residuals for work done for new media and reused on new media or from allowing signatory producers to produce non union

5242556 sag negotiators and industry representatives continue to have informal discussions regarding a successor tv theatrical agreement
5242557 it is not at all unusual for both parties in large negotiations like ours to meet in smaller more manageable groups to talk about remaining outstanding issues in an effort to reach accord
5242558 every effort by sags negotiators to reopen these talks to fundamentally alter the new media terms and make unreasonable economic demands has been flatly and consistently rejected by the producers at every level of these talks
5242559 the amptps position on its final offer could not be any clearer and no amount of dead of the night emails by sag leaders is going to change the fundamental facts negotiations concluded when the producers presented their final offer on june 30 2008 and no meetings formal or informal are scheduled
5242560 as the amptp knows and as we have reported to our members on several occasions substantive discussions about contract issues have occurred with ceos amptp committee members and staff on a continuing basis since the last formal meeting of the full committees
5242561 the details of these discussions are confidential any suggestion that this is not the case is intentional misdirection and completely false
5242562 all of us in new york hollywood and across the country should be concerned about how this failure to reach an agreement is impacting our members

5242616 the zimbabwean issue is far from resolved and so the continent as a whole has a responsibility to continue to engage with us in finding solutions
5242617 part of it is actually a process of trying to unlock the deadlocks that have emerged in the negotiations
5242618 are you telling me stephanie is some sort of medieval death goddess or something
5242619 not a death goddess not medieval either for that matter no shes just married to the god of the dead
5242620 eh depends on which version you read a lot of these stories have multiple versions like persephones father some stories say he was zeus some say she was a virgin birth
5242621 do you two want me to go stick my head in the oven until you guys get back around to something that makes sense
5242622 anyway no matter what the details the important thing is that hades pulled persephone underground demeter was so upset she refused to make the crops grow the world got cold and nasty and all the humans were starving to death finally zeus couldnt take it anymore so he went down to tell hades to let persephone go
5242623 when they got there persephone already ate some pomegranate seeds right
5242624 bingo hades conned her into eating them but since it was just seeds demeter kind of forced a compromise persephone had to marry hades and spend one month a year in the underworld for every seed she ate and during those months she was underground nothing would grow on earth
5242625 when persephone was on earth the sun would shine and the crops would grow spring and summer then she goes back down in the fall and stuff stops growing autumn and winter
5242626 look this little english lesson is fascinating but am i the only one who thinks weve all lost our collective minds
5242627 yo harvest goddess and all her talk about being from down south
5242628 didnt she say she never wanted to marry her husband too
5242629 so youre saying hades is the one who sent all those guys after me the one who couldnt drink the coffee and the guy who turned into the hawk and the guy with the pebble
5242630 sisyphus zeus seduced some farmers daughter somewhere and sisyphus told on him so he got punished in the underworld he has to keep pushing a boulder to the top of a mountain over and over again for all eternity it just keeps rolling down and he has to start over
5242631 and look at this winner tantalus killed and roasted his own son and served him to the gods for dinner only demeter was dumb enough to eat any of the kid but they punished tantalus by sticking him in a pond forever hes always thirsty but the water always drains away before he can sip it
5242632 considering our previous theory involved a highly localized black hole in the bottom of his coffee cup i think it makes as much sense as anything else
5242633 so our working theory is that i spent last summer dating a greek goddess who was taking a little vacation from her husband the god of death
5242634 they thought monogamy was something you built coffee tables out of nobody carved as many notches in their bedpost as big daddy zeus but our girl persephone kind of got around too
5242635 the persephone in these books doesnt really sound like our girl
5242636 you can say the b word in front of me
5242637 the point is stephanie wasnt like that in fact ovid says that the only time her heart ever thawed was when this guy orpheus came to the underworld to try to get his dead wife back he sang so beautifully that even persephone wept of course orpheus screwed it up on the way home and lost his wife anyway man those greeks just didnt believe in a happy ending
5242638 its been a few thousand years people change in fact isnt that what the guy with the pebble said that his master was different than in the old days
5242639 prepare yourself adam i may never say this again i think hes got a point
5242640 think about it for centuries these greek gods were where it was at worshippers sacrifices all the comely maidens they could seduce then a couple of thousand years ago zippo people stopped believing in them what if it drove him crazy
5242641 you mean a lack of worshippers made hades go crazy and turned persephone into a sweet girl
5242642 crazier things have happened think about it how many times have we seen some washed up celebrity who couldnt handle it when they werent famous anymore and just had a total breakdown robbed a bank beat their wives drank themselves to death
5242643 it sounds like hades has turned the underworld into a real hell man thats got to be a bummer
5242644 not in greece everyone went to the underworld when they died good bad or indifferent the ones set up for punishment went to tartarus thats the place where the nasty people got tortured for all time like our friends sisyphus and tantalus the heroes went to the elysian fields their version of paradise but for most people they just kind of hung around in hades empty shells of the people they used to be
5242645 but from what the pebble guy sissypants said it sounds like its pretty bad all over down there now right
5242646 i mean its stupid and crazy and insane and if we told it to anybody outside of this room theyd strap us into a hug yourself jacket and throw us in a rubber room but damned if i can come up with anything better
5242647 only problem is adam what do we do with this information
5242648 if all of this is real im still sticking with if for now then that means stephanie should be out and about in the world for the next few months right
5242649 well then that gives me a few months to find her because until i do theres absolutely nothing anyone can say that will give any of us any peace
5242650 its a guy with a big ass pair of wings now will you let me in weve got a lot to talk about
5242651 i am surprised hes holding out i dont know where hes getting his advice hes played four years and hes played every game once and hes been hurt three times i know if i was in the front office even if it wasnt steven even if it was someone else on another team it would be hard for me to justify giving them a lot of money regardless if he was the team
5242652 its just unfortunate that sometimes and its happened to a lot of great players when they play behind a player that had length and longetivity and did it well in a way that people respect they sometimes dont know how to deal with it they dont know where to take it and thats one of those situations where hes trying to carve a niche for himself and he wants that to be so different from me that hes doing a lot of things that i didnt do but those are the things i didnt do because you dont need to not because i didnt want to
5242653 when i will grow up i want to be pr 10

5242663 under the control of the uvf leadership but not accessible for use by members
5242664 they said a thing in the statement it even galled me to read it out but i read it out anyhow that the arms had been bunkered beyond reach and the general de chastelain had been contacted
5242665 i said why not take the ultimate step it wouldnt only add to the statement
5242666 now i look forward if i am still living to stand on some podium to say that the uvf have decommissioned their weapons that would be my dream that would be i suppose the icing on the cake
5242667 if you are the leader you lead from the front perhaps maybe after consultation you have to have the confidence in yourself the confidence in your men to say im making a direct order here that uvf arms will be dispensed with decommissioned call it what you want i expect every man to obey that
5242668 many people have asked why we have had two memorial services but the question should be why should we not have two memorial services
5242669 over 10 years we have taken control of our own lives we did not allow the terrorists to dictate to us back then and we will continue to do what is right for us
5242670 the only proper tribute to the dead of omagh 10 years on must be that a full cross border public inquiry takes place
5242671 we have not received justice in omagh it is not wreaths we need it is justice and truth
5242672 if i were with you today i would ask you to do one thing and that is to look to the future
5242673 a new generation has grown up in omagh and is it to them that we should look static memorials have their place but living memorials also have tremendous value
5242674 would it not be wonderful if a scholarship fund might be established in the name of the young people who died 10 years ago perhaps one which would enable a young person from the town to spend time with the united nations or at a university who engaged in peace studies
5242675 if one of these could be established it would one way of bringing good out of tragedy
5242676 they are the people who have not deserted us and who have consistently supported us during the last 10 years
5242677 with the exception of the lincoln memorial which is really just a stone statue beautiful as it may be its not a place abraham lincoln ever went
5242678 the hardest part of the construction is bringing a historic building up to modern day technology but the park service has been very cooperative in helping us make it work
5242679 it seems like people are saying hey were not going to go halfway across the country but well sure take that trip to six flags or busch gardens and well spend the night
5242680 for the most part people are still traveling they are just changing their behaviors maybe they are looking at it as a basket of goods and services so they might be trading in on hotels
5242681 we travel about the same but cut back on other things like fancy restaurants
5242682 we dont spend as much money when we get into town
5242683 with b and bs you can drive to the next town and stay someplace completely different and really feel like you have gotten away
5242684 people in the area only explore it or experience it when they have out of own visitors when people are looking to save money we are encouraging them to explore right here at home
5242685 when most of us dream about getting away from it all we really mean we want to get away from it all i dont think most of us can really relax and recharge when we still have the usual surroundings
5242686 i think that part of the joy of traveling is you are meeting other people who are also away and you can share experiences with them and going elsewhere on vacation is a wonderful way to keep ourselves stimulated
5242687 cleaner cheaper quieter car for local travel and the gas tank is always there should you need to drive longer distances
5242688 having lots of hunters in one place increases the possibility of mishaps
5242689 under normal circumstances opening day of dove season is probably the busiest hunting day of the year other than deer and turkey seasons and this year is not normal
5242690 we always see greater participation when dove opener falls on a weekend
5242691 most years there are enough managed dove fields to provide hunting opportunities without overcrowding
5242692 by courteous i mean not crowding hunters already in the field
5242693 just because you are on a public area doesnt mean it is okay to walk in on other hunters and start hunting so close to them that it diminishes their enjoyment
5242694 i would suggest that hunters do more scouting this year than they might ordinarily do
5242695 you can pretty well count on managed dove fields being crowded on opening day this year for myself i would rather find a hunting spot that has fewer hunters
5242696 doves need water and grit and they prefer to roost in dead trees if you can find all those things within sight of each other you are in business if there happens to be a crop field close by thats even better
5242697 a cap at the least will help other hunters know you are there
5242698 that is a very soft area and more vulnerable to injury than the rest of your body even if you dont wear glasses get a pair of shooters glasses
5242699 dont shoot if you cant see sky above and well below your target its best not to shoot at an angle lower than 45 degrees from the horizon
5242700 even shooting at a safe angle you can rain shot down on others if you arent careful
5242701 a wounded bird can be chased down on foot recovering a downed bird isnt worth the chance of a ricochet off the ground
5242702 they make catching cripples much easier and they allow you to stay at your shooting station where other hunters are expecting you to be take plenty of water for your canine companion and be alert for signs of distress dogs can die of heat stroke
5242703 that sounds obvious but it is easy to forget when doves are flying and the shooting is fast under those kinds of conditions you have to make a conscious effort not to let down your guard unload your gun every now and then and take a short breather to take a drink of water water your dog and watch other hunters you might miss a shot or two but you are less likely to go home with a heart full of regret because you lost your cool

5242776 weve had a republican and i have moments when i approve and moments when i dont approve

5242783 i am happy just to be alive after the injury i was complaining of asthma after surgery last year but it was not that i missed an injection and blood went into my lungs football was not the most important thing i nearly lost my life
5242784 sometimes when things happen you can be knocked off if you are not strong mentally but i am strong mentally and i never give up which is why i am still going strong
5242785 i have been so worried that i can hardly watch football i wish so often that i am on the field but i dont brood over some things i know when the time is right i will enjoy my football again there are ups and downs the most important thing is not to give up because i have given it my all to be able to come back
5242786 stephen can play again but when i will return will remain a surprise i dont want to rush the comeback i want everything to be gradual i have been out for one year and i understand it will take time to get my rhythm back

5242912 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5242913 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5242914 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5242930 we have come a long way from our first year
5242931 i kind of thought he was crazy but he did it
5242932 we have added many committed players and shed some less committed players
5242933 we have solidified our organization and have been improving our community relations every year
5242934 i was around since the beginning and went to all the games events and meetings with my mother and brother so i know a lot about the team for a 9 year old
5242935 someday i am going to be the owner of the organization
5242936 i am so fortunate to have the opportunity to cheer for a team that allows me to be myself and have fun in a relaxed environment
5242937 it gets hectic sometimes when i have to work late and then go straight to practice when that happens i dont get to put my girls ages 2 and 10 months to bed which i love doing
5242938 its tough but if you want to do it bad enough you find a way
5242939 i wish i could play til the day i die

5242946 take a taxi to kuttikattoor and ask for the arabian bride kunhamina she is famous there because of her ludicrous marriage and no need of a postal address or phone number
5242947 policemen regularly come knocking on our door threatening us with deportation my mother has been running from pillar to post for the last 14 years trying to get citizenship for my younger brother and me no photographs please as they mean nothing but further humiliation
5242948 i will continue to strive for indian citizenship for both of my children they have no place to dwell other than india you take any number of my photographs if they can ensure citizenship for my children
5242949 as a last resort i met chief minister vs achuthanandan last week and pleaded for his intervention he promised maximum efforts on the part of state government to persuade an otherwise unwilling union government
5242950 since a large number of children of arab marriages were born in middle east and came here with their indian mothers they do not have the citizenship in either country and face deportation when they become adults
5242951 arab marriages are taking place clandestinely in north kerala even now though there is widespread propaganda that they are not taking place in this literate and progressive state barely an year ago the kozhikode police arrested two arabs on charges of marrying teenage girls and sexually abusing them
5242952 i have never seen my father i have no clue about his whereabouts even the name and address he gave to my mothers family were fake
5242953 now i am struggling hard to forget the bitter experiences of the past
5242954 my father yusuf mubaraq has done nothing for us but his three sons in oman helped us a lot financially after his death however the extreme humiliation and neglect by the society had already crippled my ambition to excel in life
5242955 it is poverty that makes these girls get into such marriages sometimes a kindly arab might look after the girl for a lifetime why prevent that
5242956 if anything worthwhile is to be done poverty should be wiped out there can be no cosmetic changes

5242958 and mama theyre mating at night and mamma they wont make nice
5242959 my personal trainer works with brescia and i did a lot of work with him there during the off season so maybe that is where the rumours are from
5242960 but there are a few offers i am studying even though i am not in a hurry i want to make the right choice
5242961 a new circuit means that there is a new challenge something new to discover new corners new set up a new way of driving because every race is a different story
5242962 ive seen the lay out and the location but the best way to prepare for racing on a new track is to get there as soon as possible to spot the small details on the track the best way to understand a circuit is to drive it and i cant wait
5242963 we can expect valencia to be a race which is going to be very hard on the brakes a little bit similar to montreal
5242964 also we will have to see how the surface is
5242965 i hope they dont make too rash a decision now while they are upset after the game
5242966 hopefully they will take a bit of time and decide what they want to do we would love them to give it another shot they are huge players for us and hugely influential in the dressing room
5242967 i knew we were in trouble after going about one furlong she kept changing her legs and paddling and couldnt handle the ground at all
5242968 it is true to say that we have had interest and some good offers from teams in other championships but formula 1 is what we are concentrating on
5242969 its where takuma deserves to be and naturally we are talking to a number of people about 2009
5242970 will look and sound old and weak next to obama
5242971 we didnt like doing what we did justin was a nice man and a good hurling man
5242972 but we thought we were just missing that little something that we werent sure that wed get out of justin
5242973 we felt that we needed something to get to an all ireland final
5242974 there are lads in their 30s that have never played in an all ireland final all they wanted to do was play in one

5242979 the outflow of client money is extremely regrettable and it hurts but you have to keep it in perspective
5242980 we are talking about an outflow of around one per cent of the total assets of the wealth management business we can bring back confidence by turning in a profit again
5242981 we will handle all our other legal problems in the same energetic way
5242982 managers and staff who do not add to earnings will have to feel that in their salaries
5242983 id like to ask five star why theyre so fucking crap
5242984 oh i must get this potato out if i just dodge in and out what could possibly go wrong
5242985 at the heart of our portal is that you can get a lot of information from the community
5242986 theres been user generated content in investing for a long time but its been in the form of discussion boards
5242987 with discussion boards things tend to fall off the bottom of the page and theres little incentive to make a really good post our site gives people a platform where they can share their knowledge
5242988 weve put in mechanisms to help prevent stuff like that
5242989 people are encouraged to build a long term reputation on the site
5242990 the only people who bother to spend a lot of time writing are the people who actually know something about the topic
5242991 i was frustrated that the personal finance blogosphere didnt really have a center spot
5242992 so i began putting together a catalog of personal finance blogs with listings by topic i came up with a framework that i hoped would make it easier for readers to find out the main theme of a blog i gave the opportunity for people to list their main topics give a summary of their blogs purpose and their views and even link to their best posts i hoped that this would be useful for readers to find blogs which fit what they were looking for and that bloggers would be willing to participate because it was free advertising
5242993 now that the former part is doing well id like to get more personal finance information itself on the site
5242994 sort of a stage two what are index funds what is a 401 k
5242995 i think its currently unique for its focus on the blogosphere for both bloggers and readers
5242996 there are lots of great finance facts in for example but nothing ive seen about personal finance blogs accumulating finance information is only one of the finwikians goals the main goal being to link people to sites which will provide them a more daily dose if they subscribe
5242997 people like to have a voice and they like flexibility
5242998 nothing is static on a wiki you can add your own blog listing or point of view to a topic then readers like to be able to find information quickly i hope people like this one because it helps them find useful information even if thats not on the wiki itself

5243002 he just made some mistakes early in the game and the guys hit him
5243003 otherwise that doesnt happen to him too often some days that happens
5243004 whenever you have a chance to get those pitchers out of the game quick its good to get to their bullpen and work their bullpen
5243005 it was a good day for everybody i guess that gave us a little more confidence
5243006 the fastballs he threw ran back over the middle they were elevated
5243007 we spent the majority of the day doing that they were pretty consistent in scoring
5243008 the way we came out swinging the bats against beckett today is a big lift for us
5243009 i think we thought today was going to be one of those games where one or two runs was going to be tough to come by to have our guys set the tone early was a big lift

5243027 after receiving complaints from nearby businesses about the level of noise from market traders at particular times we felt that we had to officially ask the operators if they would tone this down
5243028 we must stress that we appreciate that calling out is part of the standard practice on markets but we had to agree with people working in the area that on some occasions this has gone beyond what is felt to be reasonable
5243029 we talked directly to the traders about this on a number of occasions before sending this letter which is not asking them to stop calling only to reduce the volume and frequency of the calling
5243030 this is absolutely ridiculous theres nothing left in this country anymore
5243031 shouting is part of the colour and vibrancy of markets and creates a lot of jollity and banter
5243032 even small traces are extremely toxic as they persist in the body for a long time and accumulate in the human tissues

5243035 as one of the worlds most dynamic economies whose gdp surged to us 53 9 billion last year and with an annual average growth rate of some 8 dubai continues to serve as a model for development and diversification
5243036 reducing our dependence on hydrocarbons which now account for less than 5 of gdp while simultaneously encouraging new public private partnerships and creating vast numbers of new employment opportunities the emirate is an inspiration to the region and indeed the wider global community
5243037 under the guidance of hh sheikh mohammed bin rashid al maktoum vice president and prime minister of the uae and ruler of dubai the emirate has been transformed into a full and leading participant in the global economy
5243038 as outlined in the dubai strategic plan 2015 the emirate aims to increase productivity by 4 annually while raising its gdp to some us 108 billion and increasing per capita gdp to us 44 000 by 2015
5243039 during this period of sustained economic growth development and diversification the government of dubai also continues to recognise the importance of demonstrating to the regional and international community the emirates ongoing commitment to good governance and its upholding of the highest regulatory standards
5243040 at the investment corporation of dubai whose portfolio includes all of the emirates wholly or partly owned government businesses we fully support this drive to ensure the highest levels of corporate governance and transparency
5243041 focused on both local and international opportunities icd manages its own portfolio of assets in line with such global standards and we encourage all entities in the emirate both public and private to share our commitment to these principles today and into the future

5243050 there will be a few tears at the end of the day but there will be lots of stories great music a beer or two and maybe the odd cuban cigar
5243051 he brought great pleasure to the people of ireland and yet more around the world ronnie will be greatly missed by many but most particularly by his family with whom our thoughts are today
5243052 ronnie whether as part of the dubliners or during his solo career will also be remembered for his promotion of irish music both at home and around the world he bore his illness with bravery and will be sadly missed
5243053 his contribution to irish music and irish life was immeasurable and his influence will be felt for many many years to come
5243054 and hed be like man the pizza is good today
5243055 i just wanted to make sure i took every single moment in and every single swim in every single moment with my teammates so i would remember them
5243056 to swim in the same era as him has been awesome
5243057 weve been talking about mark spitz for 36 years now
5243058 i dont know if im going to be alive when they stop talking about this bloke you wonder if we are going to see someone as good as this again
5243059 being able to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when i was tired and i didnt want to be there
5243060 im just thankful for him having done what he did
5243061 the sport of swimming has come a long way so far and i think it can go even further
5243062 mike is opening a lot of doors with what hes doing
5243063 i just want to lay in my own bed for five minutes at least and just relax
5243064 one of the things im really looking forward to is getting back to baltimore
5243065 hes more naturally suited for longer distances itll be change for him but i think itll be a good one
5243066 when we train every day sometimes there are workouts you dont like dont want to do bob says youre putting money in the bank
5243067 i guess i put a lot of money in the bank over the last four years and we withdrew pretty much every penny in the bank after bob and i both grab a little break itll be time to start depositing
5243068 i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years
5243069 as he turned away he turned back and said i thought about it
5243070 this is one of those times where everything seemed to be clicking
5243071 wed like to have scored on the first drive all in all it was good i was ok with it
5243072 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
5243073 very much in control of the huddle like he always is and very much in control of the game and that allowed us to be in control as an offense as a unit we felt like everything that we were going to run was going to work
5243074 does that sound a little awkward or funny maybe a little bit believe me i feel very comfortable here
5243075 as a trio we have so much to learn and so far to go
5243076 its only the second exhibition game but because of the work were putting into it it seems like eight games
5243077 i think they had some good moments and some not so good moments
5243078 there were some opportunities to learn in a game like this
5243079 i wish i would have at least caught one camp practice
5243080 i started training a little bit but when i started running again in cleats i think thats when i really aggravated it
5243081 well just see how he feels throwing tomorrow if he can
5243082 from my standpoint i think hes going to be just fine
5243083 10 recent developments in the field of user experience design most techniques may seem very futuristic but some of them are already reality
5243084 hes the only one with the experience strength and knowledge to save us from sinking
5243085 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5243086 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5243087 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5243088 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5243089 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5243090 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5243091 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5243092 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5243093 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5243094 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5243095 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5243096 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5243097 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

5243158 at the heart of our portal is that you can get a lot of information from the community
5243159 theres been user generated content in investing for a long time but its been in the form of discussion boards
5243160 with discussion boards things tend to fall off the bottom of the page and theres little incentive to make a really good post our site gives people a platform where they can share their knowledge
5243161 weve put in mechanisms to help prevent stuff like that
5243162 people are encouraged to build a long term reputation on the site
5243163 the only people who bother to spend a lot of time writing are the people who actually know something about the topic
5243164 i was frustrated that the personal finance blogosphere didnt really have a center spot
5243165 so i began putting together a catalog of personal finance blogs with listings by topic i came up with a framework that i hoped would make it easier for readers to find out the main theme of a blog i gave the opportunity for people to list their main topics give a summary of their blogs purpose and their views and even link to their best posts i hoped that this would be useful for readers to find blogs which fit what they were looking for and that bloggers would be willing to participate because it was free advertising
5243166 now that the former part is doing well id like to get more personal finance information itself on the site
5243167 sort of a stage two what are index funds what is a 401 k
5243168 i think its currently unique for its focus on the blogosphere for both bloggers and readers
5243169 there are lots of great finance facts in for example but nothing ive seen about personal finance blogs accumulating finance information is only one of the finwikians goals the main goal being to link people to sites which will provide them a more daily dose if they subscribe
5243170 people like to have a voice and they like flexibility
5243171 nothing is static on a wiki you can add your own blog listing or point of view to a topic then readers like to be able to find information quickly i hope people like this one because it helps them find useful information even if thats not on the wiki itself
5243172 i am muslim first then a lawyer i am muslim first then an mp

5243176 what sort of behaviour is that i hope the public realise that this is not something that should be condoned
5243177 we should not be blamed first an investigation had to be conducted to ascertain whether the perpetrators are our members but stern action will be taken if our members are involved

5243284 not only does nfc have a much shorter transmission range than rfid inherently making it more secure than traditional rfid but applications running over nfc technologies will more than likely encrypt the data that is being transmitted so even if there is a sniffer trying to pick up the transmission it wont pick up anything of use because of the encryption
5243285 security is something you dont just have with a purchased product you have to keep working on it every day this area needs a certain level of education on what it is and how it works in the wireless world the big challenge is how the rfid device integrates with security measures
5243286 there is no difference whether the use is short or long distance what matters more are other factors that affect security
5243287 there are multiple points with the hardware and software that allow the possibility of a breach
5243288 some vendors say im compliant today so i am ok but that is not true
5243289 rfid users need monitoring of the network this didnt exist before hardware and software vendors all have their own offerings the challenge is how to make it all work together this is the crux of what is happening
5243290 as weve always maintained we continue to bring stock into the uk on a weekly basis and wii fits recent performance in the software chart is testament to this
5243291 continual shipments into the uk will carry on right up to and through the peak season period and we are continuing to look at the current stock situation very closely
5243292 indications so far are that the tour has been very popular and the software very well received

5243306 and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
5243307 it defies common sense and it defies imagination and for people to keep on pushing this is offensive

5243309 was not the bill that was presented at the state level
5243310 when you lead that sort of life you have to understand that when your level drops then the knives will be out he is like that he likes going out and enjoying life
5243311 he was full of life ever since he arrived and thats how he won two leagues and a champions league
5243312 he has his own private life that should not be interfered with but it is true that that private life also affects his sporting performances
5243313 ronie went from being an idol for all barcelona fans to being jeered and criticised and that hurts anyone
5243314 people think that he is unprofessional and a bad team mate as if he were some sort of time bomb waiting to explode in the dressing room but he is nothing of the sort he is an example of professionalism
5243315 he knows he has made a lot of mistakes but he surprises me with the enthusiasm and sacrifice he makes in every game he wants to be the best and he is
5243316 rijkaard believes in self regulation but that is almost impossible in a team like barcelona where the players earn a lot of money and win a lot of trophies
5243317 in all collective activities there has to be order and discipline and that is what guardiola has imposed as a coach he knows what he wants and he has got some very clear ideas
5243318 maar door de toeristenbestedingen in amsterdam hebben veel winkeliers hier nog weinig last
5243319 historically deals were smaller in size and more growth oriented
5243320 on the exit side most entrepreneurs opted for an initial public offering now thats all changing the deal size has gone up to an average of 45 million and every flavor of investment can be found you see multinationals private equity players hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds cross border m amp a is also emerging as a source of opportunity the sectoral focus has widened buyouts have started to happen and some exits now involve selling to others icici ventures sold a stake in infomedia india to tv 18 as an example we see a lot of trends in india that were in china before
5243321 we are minority investors we identify high growth sectors so we can generate returns and do it without leverage
5243322 were also getting more comfortable with sectors were not familiar with it just takes more time
5243323 the bulk of our investments had been in the u s and europe control situations leveraged buyouts etc during the last few years we have been looking to expand our footprint into brazil australia japan china and four months ago india while we are used to doing control transactions in the rest of the world were seeing very little of that in china or india we wanted to tailor our own flexible strategy to do minority investments
5243324 the important thing is are you really a partner with the promoter many promoters choose private equity deals based on value but private equity players can bring lots of different things to the table access to customers access to acquisitions or even operational efficiencies
5243325 sometimes you get it wrong sometimes you get it right
5243326 the key is before you do the investment to get comfortable with the promoter you have to align the objectives on both sides which is hard when you have a powerful promoter or when many branches of a family with different viewpoints are involved with the business getting behind some of these facets is very important
5243327 looking back in time think of infosys as an example there were a few professional managers who left another enterprise and who had the technology and the right governance model in place
5243328 we do try for larger transactions were not in a rush to deploy hundreds of millions of dollars of capital over a certain number of months we dont have a specific timeline its a long term business we lived through this in china as well where we started small and over time we evolved to write larger checks we view this as a once in a lifetime opportunity for the company so we have to be patient
5243329 if we didnt have a presence there the question would be asked why are we not there as with any other sector we have to localize our product private equity for the indian market there may not be a lot of leveraged buyout opportunities but there are lots of other growth capital opportunities over the next few years we want long term relationships with these companies goldman sachs also has had the strategy of following its clients we see where they have gone every large client of goldman has an interest and a presence in india that creates a reason for us to be there also
5243330 we have very little influence so you have to do the homework before getting in
5243331 you see either a structure of command and control or where people genuinely are bettering themselves and building institutions its hard to change it once youre in there
5243332 ultimately the bet you make is on the top management team you cant spend lots of time on all these issues if you have a lot of deals
5243333 the biggest value addition they brought was a team of people to facilitate a capture and then they built a world class team around that also whenever we did an acquisition we had access to their entire teams expertise in a particular area when we wanted to open an office in romania we put our neck on the line and took a cut in variable pay and the firm supported us
5243334 one is the management team of course second alliances can add value bringing new technology customers sourcing and revenue third would be the complementarities other companies in the portfolio that we are aware of we see things on the horizon that a company may not and we can provide funding to make things happen
5243335 we all strive to be a sounding board for ceos we want them to think of us as their business partner
5243336 id like them to reach out to us thats what were there for and when we can add value if i know what problem the company management is trying to solve i can put the resources of our company at their disposal
5243337 the advantage that any private equity firm has is its relationships we have a track record of supporting companies so it sometimes allows us to get a leg up to have the opportunity to look at a deal
5243338 given the culture of negotiation they always want to find the best deal
5243339 its our responsibility to explain to them our tangible value added we may get privileged access for a short period of time or maybe one extra meeting that helps us come up with the right judgment but really theres no friends and family discount out there
5243340 one of the most provocative original thinkers on the role of religion in the modern world
5243341 in this age images are powerful enough to divide to spread fear to remove hope powerful enough to unite to build trust to inspire action until now the images of many have been in the hands of a few finally that is changing millions of people around the world are telling their own stories for the first time in history we have a chance to see the world differently to see it through the eyes of the other imagine if we could get inside each others heads for a day what would we see
5243342 is the ability to form a mental image of something that is not perceived through the senses it is the ability of the mind to build mental scenes objects or events that do not exist are not present or have happened in the past

5243386 repeat offenders travelling from country to country and flagrantly avoiding the stringent sex offender mechanisms in the uk
5243387 many of them have been teachers or volunteers in orphanages currently schools and organisations abroad have no mechanism for undertaking pre employment checks for checking the suitability of working with children through uk criminal records or other sources this is a major gap in the protection of vulnerable children
5243388 offenders are always trying to find new ways to access vulnerable children the easiest way to do that is to get into the school or orphanage system once youve got a job youve got an employment history and can travel from country to country by not allowing international organisations access to the information we hold we are putting children at risk and allowing offenders to operate without fear
5243389 there is something fundamentally wrong about the current attitude to risk and harm to children abroad when these figures are shown side by side
5243390 this sends a strong message to so called sex tourists that they wont get away with targeting other countries with less strict controls than the uk
5243391 from the autumn we also intend to make registered sex offenders notify the police of any travel abroad

5243403 a pretty decent chance of getting some meaningful rainfall as well
5243404 this is certainly what we need to put a dent in the rainfall deficit especially this time of year when were heading into our driest season

5243409 at the same time i think jerry reese as a citizen has the right to continue this litigation until its concluded
5243410 were just working as hard as we can to get this project done
5243411 certainly this legal process is hampering it however well continue to work as a team to get it done
5243412 you have to pay to defend yourself for decisions that you think are correct
5243413 its unfortunate that there are individuals who are willing to go to the extremes that mr reese is to make a point that obviously no one else is
5243414 its unfortunate but its nothing that you can really prevent
5243415 if we werent tinkering with having a professional sports team if we werent involving ourselves with what ought to be privately operated redevelopments of landscape we wouldnt have a half million dollar legal bill

5243427 the beautiful part of writing is that you dont have to get it right the first time unlike say a brain surgeon

5243452 the human mind has an apparent transition at the high ends of mathematics and physics into human philosophy this is explained by a kind of beauty known only to mathematicians that begins in logical thinking after a modest exposure to the two subjects ive often wrestled with the problem of reducing complexity to simplicity which i believe is the resolution of the lateral mind to a horizontal plane without loss of information this is not an easy task
5243453 since writing is one area that requires a lot of ingenuity and logical thinking mathematicians or physicists will most certainly find it fascinating playing around with words and semantics just as they have been taught to work around proofs theorems and figures and because writing can be so addictive and dynamic they virtually end up abandoning their world of maths and physics to venture into writing

5243458 many smaller nonprofits could be more successful if they had access to outside guidance reliable data or other tools but they simply cant afford it
5243459 our model will allow them to get the support they need within their budgets

5243463 in my work teaching nonprofit executives ive seen firsthand how valuable it could be to have a repository of tools available 24 7 in one place at one time the resource library is just that it offers sample annual fund plans job descriptions corporate solicitations and more that development directors can use as templates and customize for their own use

5243498 however there are far more blacks who will vote for obama because he is black than there are whites who would not vote for him because he is black
5243499 when our days become dreary with low hovering clouds of despair and when our nights become darker than a thousand midnights let us remember that there is a creative force in this universe working to pull down the gigantic mountains of evil a power that is able to make a way out of no way and transform dark yesterdays into bright tomorrows let us realize the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice
5243500 no one is born hating another person because of the colour of his skin or his background or his religion people must learn to hate and if they can learn to hate they can be taught to love for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite

5243507 the scrap rates have not shown signs of softening for the past one week in view of high prices in global market that is why its rates are prevailing at rs 30 500 per tonne
5243508 if the scrap rates come down it will eventually cause further decline in rates of ingot prices

5243538 it is an ho nour to be recognized for our support and contribution to the derdack success story we have been partners for 2 years and in this time we have seen a growing interest and acceptance of the mobile messaging products offered by derdack in our region
5243539 the ease with which the derdack products can be integrated into existing it systems and the speed of implementation are very important aspects of the projects we undertake in addition the innovation and vision of the derdack team helps us create new opportunities for growing our business which is good news for both ihorizons and derdack
5243540 we invest time in ensuring our partner channel can be effective the annual derdack partner conference allows us to say thank you to our part ners update them on our plans for the year ahead and enable them to see new product developments we have built a strong revenue stream with the help of our partners and we all look forward to 2009 being another year of growth
5243541 the survey paints a stark picture of the challenging business environment that has emerged in the uk over the past year with the economy facing its most difficult period since the early 1990s this is now compounded by high and uncertain oil and commodity prices creating inflationary pressures and fall out from the uk housing market downturn which has continued to gather pace at the same time we are seeing a new realism among businesses about the need to weather the current economic conditions with projected staff and capital investment both significantly down on this time last year
5243542 as an increased number of businesses express concern over late payment effective cash flow management is now more essential than ever for those sectors with rising input costs such as manufacturing and transport amp storage
5243543 we expect the slowdown to be at its worst towards the end of 2008 and into early 2009 we also expect inflation to start falling back from early 2009 allowing the bank of england room to cut interest rates throughout 2009 nevertheless overall the performance of uk plc through 2009 is likely to be the weakest growth since 1992 when the economy grew by just 0 3 per cent however towards the end of 2009 providing wage inflation stays low economic activity looks likely to pick up

5243545 telephony is critical to the success of our company and gohello has enabled an easy to use mobile service which our employees love and requires no technical expertise or understanding i would highly recommend gohellos allmobile telephony to anyone wanting to move away from the restrictions and complications of a fixed line phone system
5243546 with our previous telephony solution we often felt that important phone calls were missed due to our small workforce and travelling demands the gohello solution has overcome this as calls are now routed directly to employees mobiles our customers may not have noticed our new telephone system but that can only be a good thing by using gohello we dont need to worry about taking messages keeping the office manned or costly business calls leaving us to do what we do best running the business

5243561 this is surely an indictment on customer data standards at any organisation that sends transactional documents all of whom want to grasp the transpromo opportunity but a section of whom seem to be undermining that opportunity
5243562 if transpromo is to be effectively exploited there needs to be an improvement in customer data standards two fifths of the population have received bills or statements addressed to the wrong person in the last six months which could seriously undermine consumer attitudes to advertising carried in those documents the opportunities presented by transpromo are probably very considerable but their effective use requires british business to make significant enhancements to the way it manages and updates customer records
5243563 whilst operators understandably dont want to be perceived as trying to unfairly glean excess revenues from unwitting subscribers while abroad taking a one size fits all approach blocking their usage while abroad will result in them losing very significant revenues at a time when you would expect them to be looking to maximise their 3g network investments
5243564 operators need to take better control of their network assets so that they can offer a bespoke service to each user on a case by case basis
5243565 in a competitive european market where operators are increasingly trying to differentiate their service and the many millions of corporate subscribers are becoming increasingly international operators surely have no choice but to ensure they maximise all mobile broadband revenue opportunities whilst offering subscribers the best possible service
5243566 sci fi is our umbrella brand for casual and online gaming in the uk and other countries outside the usa science fiction and fantasy fans have a huge affinity with gaming and our relationship with bigpoint will allow us to take advantage of growing popularity of multiple players

5243568 we are delighted with the popularity of fishtext and feedback so far indicates that users are extremely pleased with the service
5243569 fishtexts success demonstrates that traditional text messaging is an overpriced and underdeveloped service many users have expressed surprise that the fishtext mobile application delivers text messages all over the world so reliably for just a couple of pence while their own operator charges over ten times that amount with some not even providing delivery reports or charging extra for them

5243577 our results show that almost half of people questioned felt they had bought their endowment policy on a false promise this is not just a case of a small purchase this is thousands of pounds for a house that we are talking about
5243578 there are several reasons that somebody may have been mis sold an endowment policy including a lack of adequate explanation an endowment policy is not a short term commitment and this should have been made clear when the policy was bought as should the fees and risks involved
5243579 without this information people were unable to make an informed decision and should be able to claim some compensation depending on the circumstances

5243703 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
5243704 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect

5243707 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion

5243711 if there are and high energy particles coming from the sun the satellites could be affected and their connections could be lost
5243712 i hope such satellites will be more widely accepted in the world satellite market based on this success
5243713 todays flight represents an event of historical significance for and we hope for the commercial satellite industry the first japan made commercial telecommunications satellite now we have come up with our own standard satellite platform the ds 2000 with the launch of superbird 7 we will work to establish a firm position in the market as a competitive and reliable japan based commercial satellite manufacturer
5243714 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5243715 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5243716 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
5243717 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability

5243719 hey mister if you dont get those ads off the air in the next 48 hours then your military record and my military record are going to become a major issue in this campaign youve invited it and if you insist on permitting this stuff to continue then its going to be an issue

5243729 look give me a summary of the kinds of things we want to say
5243730 i am married to the next president of the united states
5243731 run for governor ok what do i have to do
5243732 a total of 49 deaths corresponding to 1 18 per cent mortality among the enrolled patients were recorded during the studies
5243733 as our organisation is working for the welfare of children facing medical challenges we used to hear or read that several studies are being conducted on human babies in the country
5243734 i wanted to get the factual information on such trials so we can press the government to formulate some specific policy to regulate it
5243735 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5243736 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5243737 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5243738 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5243739 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america

5243743 but i know that the first minister rhodri morgan has made arrangements at the end of the month to meet the athletes those who have succeeded and all the members who have competed and i hope to be part of that ceremony
5243744 and i think we should also remember though we celebrate gold medals and so on we should also remember that just to reach the olympics has required a great deal of hard work and sweat
5243745 and that is the important thing to get as many people involved to begin with and from there you also have to support the best
5243746 sometimes people would say we want to pursue excellence at one end and also to get as many people involved at the other end and we shouldnt regard them as competing goals
5243747 but in fact there is a tension i think you have to be careful i suppose where you place the balance
5243748 taking money away certainly from cultural activities but also perhaps from grassroots sporting activities to develop the pitches and facilities that you need in order to train

5243771 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5243772 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5243773 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5243774 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5243775 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
5243776 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
5243777 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
5243778 a remarkable indictment of the corruption and cynicism rife among climate scientists
5243779 if nothing is done all the polar bears could die in our lifetime
5243780 science keeps getting stronger and the mathematical models keep getting better
5243781 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
5243782 scott you being unaware lord christopher monckton of brenchleys paper posted by roy august 16 2008 10 55 pm
5243783 expert scientists disagreed on the key contributor to global warming at a senate environment and public works committee hearing roy w spencer former nasa scientist during the clinton administration attributes the majority of global warming contributions to errors in measurement spencer claimed that the clinton administration told him what he could and could not say to congress about global warming and greenhouse emissions chairwoman barbara boxer d calif cited spencers blog where he admits that the clinton administration never told him what was and was not permissible to say to congress
5243784 few seem to realise that the present ipcc models predict almost unanimously that by 2040 the average summer in europe will be as hot as the summer of 2003 when over 30 000 died from heat by then we may cool ourselves with air conditioning and learn to live in a climate no worse than that of baghdad now but without extensive irrigation the plants will die and both farming and natural ecosystems will be replaced by scrub and desert what will there be to eat
5243785 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
5243786 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter

5243790 i can even listen to that song the first time i heard it i was in total shock it promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray
5243791 she is our daughter and we love her and cant cut her out of our lives but we strongly disagree with how she is conducting herself and she knows how disappointed we are
5243792 the message she is promoting is about homosexuality which the bible clearly states is a sin
5243793 some of her outfits are too revealing and her father has had words with her about it she changed when she went to l a and is going through a period of rebellion katy is not a homosexual and has just been led astray by hollywood
5243794 shes told me oh mom im not going to turn into but i pray all the time god will help her find salvation
5243795 ekaterina is living in a fantasy world to say she has won ronnie is ridiculous particularly as there isnt a competition
5243796 this silly child is trying to play grown ups but she is just showing how immature and unready she is for an adult relationship
5243797 ronnie is still trying to save his marriage and jo is desperate to see him nursed back to health for her this isnt some playground contest with another woman
5243798 ekaterina will never have what jo and ronnie have together
5243799 being in a showbiz marriage is like anything else its like any other marriage you sort of stumble along and reconnect and lose each other and reconnect again

5243806 at uc berkeley ee100 is the introduction to electrical engineering class for non ee majors the goal of this course is to serve as a hands on electronics class we use multisim in the ee100 course because it is easy to use and abstracts the messy details of spice multisim also provides very useful features like the breadboard tool and instruments like the multimeter we can show students how to wire an ammeter without blowing fuses multisim also integrates with labview and this helps our students compare simulation data to experimental data
5243807 we are excited change things up this time and work with josh weve never stayed in one place too long and the evolution continues there is an aggressive shift in the material and our approach the bar has been raised
5243808 this is great news for us the first 18 months to two years is a very important period for every organisation for us weve seen a big increase in traffic as the laskys brand becomes more and more well known we see this as a huge opportunity for us to take advantage of being so soon after launching computing products simply means that our customers trust us a great deal our aim is to be an authority site in electrical goods so this step is just a result of our hard work on our way to achieving this goal

5243810 the whirlpool brand is a household name their history and knowledge in the white goods industry is well known so it comes as no surprise to learn that their new dishwasher and washing machine are both seriously effective at what they do

5243812 with the validation of qtinno tm our lead product essentially complete this announcement marks the first step in our aggressive commercialization effort adding an industry leader like vinnie to our team is a win for newcardio its employees customers and shareholders he brings proven skills in the life sciences health care and information technology industries with particular expertise in business development partnership formation and support of innovative software based technologies he adds deep understanding of the clinical trials industry product development life cycle and the proven ability to create business development and customer service teams this expertise should prove invaluable as we strive to add clinical and diagnostic value to the hundreds of millions of ecgs performed every year in health care settings clinical trials and life screening settings
5243813 it is clear to me that newcardios three dimensional software platform has the potential to become a game changing technology with many applications targeting large rapidly growing underserved markets as an example the companys initial product qtinno tm promises much needed automation to replace a costly labor intensive process in cardiac safety assessment in clinical research particularly in large scale thorough qt studies that are required for all compounds prior to fda submission i believe qtinno tm will be quickly embraced by drug sponsors who are looking to accelerate clinical trials and cut costs while ensuring regulatory compliance i also believe contract research organizations looking to expand their product and service offerings in order to increase margins and compete more effectively for market share will embrace the product as well government regulators are also looking for processes which provide more precise predictable and rapid data as evidenced by the fdas participation in the cardiac safety research consortium beyond this lead product the technology has the potential to advance the diagnostic capability of the traditional electrocardiogram ecg to address a broader range of cardiac care to include patient monitoring emergency room diagnosis and life screening diagnosis by providing automated high quality assessment data and predictive markers generated through the companys proprietary technology that generates three dimensional models for visual review its an exciting time to join newcardio and i look forward to leading the commercialization of this exciting technology platform

5243819 if someones looking to commit a crime in plainville theres a good chance hes been involved in similar behavior in nearby communities or he associates with others from those communities and theres a good chance that theres valuable information on that individual in the local rms systems in those communities
5243820 individually none of our towns can afford the number of police needed to keep track of all the activities of an increasingly mobile population of offenders
5243821 infoexchange is effectively a force multiplier for small towns like ours letting us use the intelligence gathered from neighboring police departments to fill in the gaps and work smarter our five towns with our limited resources are now actually doing what everyone has just been talking about since 9 11 communicating and sharing data
5243822 since its introduction just a year ago infoexchange has been helping hundreds of officers and investigators across the u s to be safer and smarter

5243829 in the summer of 2007 as arctic sea ice reached a record low the northwest passage opened between baffin bay and mcclure strait also known as mclure strait passing through parry channel this opening would be the route through the arctic most conducive to large scale shipping as of early august 2008 arctic sea ice was not expected to set a new melt record although its extent was well below the long term average whether the northwest passage would open as far north as it did the previous year remained in question but the sea ice in a more southerly route one taken by norwegian explorer roald amundsen in the early twentieth century had begun to melt
5243830 pete your just a denier the register didnt just make numbers up out of thin air they based on research from people who you know actually study the climate once again this doesnt fit your meme and mindset im hear to free ideologs like you and brian from your mind set

5243832 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
5243833 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
5243834 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
5243835 mussels are an extremely popular choice in restaurants and we believe our range brings real innovation into the foodservice sector

5243854 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment

5243861 disparities in jury outcomes baltimore city vs three surrounding jurisdictions an empirical examination
5243862 the issue had been raised to us many times of whether it is difficult to convict people in the city
5243863 go behind the numbers to figure out why something is happening
5243864 we analyze cases not from a statistical standpoint but from a realistic standpoint
5243865 we look at how we can address issues that negatively impact on outcomes things like better training attorneys and police
5243866 we believe the report is very flawed and needs a lot of work if it is to be released as a definitive study on jury disparities
5243867 it is the combination of all of these factors which allows me to say with confidence that given the data limitations many of the differences among the jurisdictions have been accounted for
5243868 neutralize city residents negative perceptions of the criminal justice system
5243869 generally speaking citizens in the three comparison jurisdictions tend to be more advantaged in all respects than those in baltimore city they are better educated are wealthier and are more likely to own their own homes
5243870 are also less likely to suffer from the structural disadvantage and social disorganization which often results in the higher incidence of crime and victimization from crime
5243871 i am simply appalled that in the name of science and research you reach a conclusion that because a large number of city residents live in poverty and among crime they are incapable of performing their civic duty
5243872 more aggressively than other jurisdictions choosing to pursue the highest charge possible and allowing either the jury or the plea bargaining process to find the balancing point that would equalize the punishment of the defendant to fit the crime
5243873 i hope they dont make too rash a decision now while they are upset after the game
5243874 hopefully they will take a bit of time and decide what they want to do we would love them to give it another shot they are huge players for us and hugely influential in the dressing room
5243875 im pleased to get out on my own and start playing

5243894 our findings indicate a favourable influence of linoleic acid on high blood pressure a well known cardiovascular disease risk factor these results lend support to current recommendations for increased ingestion of polyunsaturated fatty acids from vegetable sources in place of saturated fatty acids from animal sources for cardiovascular disease prevention
5243895 its so hard to leave you have to worry about break ins if youre here you can keep an eye on things
5243896 as long as the grotto stands key west will never again experience the full brunt of a hurricane
5243897 however the conditions and processes required for safe accountable and voluntary reintegration of the 5 000 people sheltered in camps in gauteng have not been met
5243898 communities affected by the violence have engaged amongst themselves and although hostility still continues in a few communities the vast majority of those displaced have been reintegrated
5243899 alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last
5243900 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5243901 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5243902 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5243903 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5243904 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5243905 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5243906 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5243907 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
5243908 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
5243909 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
5243910 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
5243911 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
5243912 recycling is recycling glass should be included its not about making money its about making difference
5243913 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5243914 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5243915 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5243916 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5243917 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5243918 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5243919 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5243920 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
5243921 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
5243922 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
5243923 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5243924 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5243925 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5243926 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5243927 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5243928 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5243929 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
5243930 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
5243931 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
5243932 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
5243933 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
5243934 just so you all know we did set a record
5243935 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
5243936 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
5243937 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
5243938 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
5243939 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
5243940 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
5243941 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
5243942 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
5243943 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
5243944 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
5243945 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
5243946 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
5243947 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
5243948 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
5243949 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
5243950 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
5243951 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
5243952 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
5243953 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
5243954 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
5243955 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
5243956 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5243957 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain

5243972 i am sure i speak for everyone associated with clarendon house when i offer our collective support and best wishes to sam for a full and speedy recovery
5243973 sam is a well liked student who has just finished his first year in our sixth form
5243974 he is a courteous and well behaved young man and news of the violent attack on him has shocked us all
5243975 we also offer our sympathies and backing for his family at this difficult moment for them
5243976 this was a particularly nasty incident and i would like to pay tribute to my team of officers led by det insp andy somerville who have worked so hard on this case to get it to this point
5243977 i would also like to thank officers from kent polices major crime unit who have supported our area in this investigation
5243978 our thoughts are with sam who i understand has shown signs of improvement and his family we wish him well and look forward to him making a full recovery
5243979 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
5243980 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
5243981 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
5243982 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
5243983 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
5243984 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
5243985 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late

5243993 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you

5243996 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
5243997 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5243998 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5243999 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5244000 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5244001 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5244002 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5244003 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5244004 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5244005 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5244006 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5244007 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5244008 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5244009 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
5244010 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
5244011 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
5244012 wenn er so spielt wie im uefa cup gegen famagusta habe ich auf dieser position keinen besseren

5244014 a new circuit means that there is a new challenge something new to discover new corners new set up a new way of driving because every race is a different story
5244015 ive seen the lay out and the location but the best way to prepare for racing on a new track is to get there as soon as possible to spot the small details on the track the best way to understand a circuit is to drive it and i cant wait
5244016 we can expect valencia to be a race which is going to be very hard on the brakes a little bit similar to montreal
5244017 also we will have to see how the surface is
5244018 i knew we were in trouble after going about one furlong she kept changing her legs and paddling and couldnt handle the ground at all
5244019 my personal trainer works with brescia and i did a lot of work with him there during the off season so maybe that is where the rumours are from
5244020 but there are a few offers i am studying even though i am not in a hurry i want to make the right choice
5244021 the absurdity of what you imagine to be the dark heart of conspiracy theorists wet dreams far too frequently turns out to be true
5244022 you go i know what ill do ill create a character who when hiring people to rebuild the nation we invaded says the only question ill ask is what do you think of roe v wade itll be hilarious then you read that book about the green zone in iraq
5244023 and you go oh they did that i mean how do you take things to the next level
5244024 we want to open up a facility that the communities up there want to see reopened we know how to run the business i see it as a no brainer
5244025 we dont simply want a hospital we need a hospital
5244026 weaken the financial stability of the existing not for profit hospitals in bergen county
5244027 disrupt and damage the operations of surrounding hospitals which are already challenged by drastic cutbacks in new jerseys charity care funding and the intensely competitive marketplace
5244028 a good opportunity to work with a quality partner like hackensack we think bergen county is a good area to operate a hospital
5244029 except for pascack which appears to have been under managed everybody around is doing well if not very well
5244030 the same way we treat patients here theyll be treated up there
5244031 i would not want one car dealership in town the more competition you have for quality care you get better prices and better service
5244032 dani ein gro artiges ergebnis f r dich an diesem wochenende es entspricht deinem bisher besten ergebnis dieses jahres in jordanien bist du mit deiner leistung bei dieser rallye zufrieden
5244033 nat rlich bin ich gl cklich das ergebnis ist sowohl f r die herstellerwertung als auch f r die fahrerwertung gut ich war sehr schnell habe keinen fehler gemacht und ein doppelsieg f r citroen ist perfekt
5244034 du hast dir mit mikko gestern einen ziemlich harten kampf geliefert hast du viel riskiert um deinen vorsprung zu vergr ern
5244035 ich habe gegen ber mikko am ersten tag zeit verloren er ist am anfang schnell gefahren am zweiten tag habe ich einiges am auto ver ndert und das auto hat sich sehr gut angef hlt ich hatte einen starken zweiten tag und musste nicht mehr ganz so hart mit mikko k mpfen
5244036 dieses wochenende waren die pirelli pzeros sowohl mit einer weichen als auch mit einer harten mischung im einsatz wie gut waren diese reifen
5244037 wir sind mit den reifen zufrieden da wir keinen einzigen reifenschaden hatten sie sind sehr gut nat rlich haben wir zur reifenleistung noch einige fragen aber wir m ssen sie noch testen und weiterentwickeln au erdem brauchen wir seitens der fia eine erlaubnis die reifen einzuschneiden
5244038 marc offensichtlich hat dani in dieser saison auf schotter viel dazugelernt es wird wohl nicht mehr lange dauern bis ihr zum ersten mal auf asphalt oder schotter gewinnt
5244039 wir haben zeit dani ist erst 25 jahre alt dieses jahr lernen wir viel und leisten gute arbeit f r das team na gut wir wollen gewinnen aber wir setzen uns nicht unter druck
5244040 das ist dein erster weltmeisterschaftslauf nach sieben monaten und du hast es auf das podium geschafft bist du mit dem dritten platz zufrieden
5244041 das ist ein fantastisches ergebnis f r mich aber die ganze rallye war schwierig f r mich das endresultat ist gut aber es w re besser f r mich mehr zu testen und dabei fortschritte zu machen an den ersten beiden tagen war das auto ziemlich schwierig zu fahren
5244042 aufgrund des unfalles von gigi galli ist ein platz im stobart team freigeworden hat man dir angeboten in neuseeland anzutreten
5244043 nein bis jetzt noch nicht aber ich bin 2005 mit citroen das letzte mal in neuseeland mitgefahren es wird also eine schwierige entscheidung f r malcolm wilson vielleicht w re es einfacher einen schnellen fahrer wie markus gr nholm auszuw hlen aber nat rlich w re ich sehr gerne dabei
5244044 n chstes jahr wird es keine rallye deutschland geben wirst du rallye deutschland n chstes jahr vermissen
5244045 die stra en sind hier hnlich wie bei uns in belgien ich fahre also vielleicht in belgien wenn ich diese rallye vermisse
5244046 o sil ncio da l der do psd muito mais ruidoso do que o barulho dos profissionais da conversa fiada
5244047 dass sie sich an das abkommen halten das sie unterzeichnet haben und dass sie es zeitgerecht tun
5244048 i have lost to him once before but this time i want to avenge that defeat and i will not let him get away that time i did not get points and now it will be different
5244049 last night i could not sleep and kept thinking about this bout akhil had beaten him once before so i didnt let him sleep and kept asking how to fight my opponent doniyorov because my style is very much like akhils i have modelled myself on the way akhil fights he is everything for me he is the one i wish to follow and emulate if i win a medal it will be for him
5244050 on friday in akhils bout we had fallen 2 6 behind but then came back to win we did not want that to happen to us today we told jitender to score and then backpedal step back as a strategy and it worked very well
5244051 he doniyorov was also fighting with good footwork although i was enjoying the lead there was some problem when i was told by my coaches that i have received a cut on my chin it was a bit of problem but finally i overcame him and won
5244052 i have said this before my big goal is to change the sport of swimming i want kids coming up to be a part of a new swimming it must be an even more important sport
5244053 a friend sent me some pictures and apparently my swim today was shown live during a baseball game so i guess that swimming is already changing
5244054 i am sure that my coach bob bowman and myself can think of some other goals in the next four years
5244055 i think what this really shows is that no matter what you set your imagination to you can do it
5244056 everything is possible if you dream my coach helped me to dream big when i got to him he said to me that i should dream big he told me to dream as big as you can
5244057 these things just fire me up when others make remarks we american swimmers use those comments to fuel us to get us more excited
5244058 when my coach told me this morning i said thats ok i would let my swimming do the talking but i always welcome comments and i like it it definitely motivates me
5244059 the timing system says it all there has not really been an error in the timing system that ive heard of i swam my best and as hard as i could
5244060 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
5244061 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
5244062 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
5244063 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
5244064 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
5244065 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
5244066 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
5244067 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
5244068 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5244069 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5244070 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5244071 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5244072 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5244073 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5244074 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5244075 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5244076 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5244077 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5244078 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5244079 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5244080 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5244081 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5244082 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5244083 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5244084 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5244085 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5244086 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5244087 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5244088 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5244089 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5244090 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5244091 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5244092 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5244093 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5244094 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5244095 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5244096 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5244097 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5244098 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5244099 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5244100 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5244101 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5244102 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5244103 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5244104 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
5244105 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5244106 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
5244107 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
5244108 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
5244109 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
5244110 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
5244111 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
5244112 i think its imperative that the following step be taken the president should have already and should do so very quickly convene the presidents working group on financial markets thats something that he can ask the secretary of the treasury to do this has to be coordinated across markets with the regulators here and obviously with regulators and central banks around the world
5244113 as solzhenitsyn stared at the cross drawn in the dirt his entire perspective changed he knew he was only one man against the all powerful soviet empire yet he knew there was something greater than the evil he saw in the prison camp something greater than the soviet union he knew that hope for all people was represented by that simple cross through the power of the cross anything was possible
5244114 has gradually morphed from being about the humanity of the guard to being about the christian faith of the guard and john mccain
5244115 but i spent thousands to come here thats not what its about
5244116 as i write this russia is waging war on my country
5244117 we are pleased to provide this tangible result of our ongoing growth and development as we believe we are on track to meet the benchmarks and goals we set for ourselves in 2006 much of our work to date has been executed to develop our infrastructure to accommodate our growth strategy we are seeing the results of the foundation we have systematically built as the industry continues to entrust us with the management of its patient members and as we welcome more healthcare providers to the 2 000 plus renaissance affiliated providers we are currently on track to achieve our projected 5 000 patient lives and 2 500 affiliated providers by the end of this calendar year
5244118 fixed maturity plans provide investors with a good alternative to fixed deposits given that they are more tax efficient this is especially so during volatile times when investors are likely to be more risk averse
5244119 it is quite normal to have to customize a tool to the needs of an organization but the effort may be too high now
5244120 this was turned down and written reasons were given to the serbian team we also allowed them to look at the video footage of the swim
5244121 although this is normally not permitted we decided to do it to be transparent and to show that we have nothing to hide the serbians looked at it and were happy
5244122 he was going to win this race anyway the only question was whether he was going to share the gold medal or get it on his own
5244123 the timing system says it all there has not really been an error in the timing system that ive heard of i swam my best and as hard as i could

5244125 in legalism nu este vorba doar de faptul ca o persoana are standarde mai inalte sau reguli mai multe decat tine multi dintre noi stereotipizam in mod gresit o persoana legalista ca fiind cineva care nu merge niciodata la film sau care crede ca muzica ritmata este de la diavol legalismul este mult mai subtil si mult mai serios de atat si mult mai convingator decat cei mai multi dintre noi realizam legalismul inseamna a cauta sa dobandesti iertarea de la dumnezeu si justificarea inaintea lui dumnezeu pe baza ascultarii tale de dumnezeu
5244126 un legalist este oricine se comporta de parca ar putea castiga iertarea aprobarea lui dumnezeu prin performantele lor personale
5244127 nu vreau s fac zadarnic harul lui dumnezeu c ci dac neprih nirea se cap t prin lege degeaba a murit hristos
5244128 dar lucrurile care pentru mine erau c tiguri le am socotit ca o pierdere din pricina lui hristos
5244129 si hay que elegir entre tener toda la tierra sin un estado jud o o un estado jud o sin toda la tierra elegimos lo ltimo
5244130 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
5244131 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
5244132 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
5244133 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
5244134 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
5244135 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
5244136 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
5244137 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
5244138 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
5244139 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
5244140 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
5244141 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
5244142 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
5244143 if a band of this young age already sounds this stunning
5244144 im really excited what theyll sound like in about 2 years

5244148 he s the only one with the experience strength and knowledge to save us from sinking
5244149 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
5244150 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
5244151 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
5244152 the information contained in that handout was to the effect that you know energy drinks are extremely high in caffeine and sugar and that the energy drinks do not fit with the school food guidelines
5244153 weve eliminated pop and other like drinks for the past year actually
5244154 we saw consumption of milk and water really significantly increase once pop was out of the schools
5244155 i think energy drinks are on the radar for every school district
5244156 it might be coincidental but there seems to be a spike in student behavioral issues with the onset of these drinks
5244157 the energy drink label would list these herbs as ingredients but the caffeine in the herbs may not be listed
5244158 because caffeine can bring about perceived changes in consciousness and mood that the student may find pleasant or advantageous it can be abused or used excessively
5244159 research has shown that some sensitive individuals experience side effects such as insomnia headaches irritability and nervousness
5244160 i personally feel that these beverages should not be sold to children since caffeine is not a nutrient and not required by the body

5244163 given the fact that the flow of the jordan river is largely appropriated for what are viewed as key economic and social uses good water management within the basin may have to be combined with a water transfer from outside the jordan basin to restore the dead sea level to a reasonable level
5244164 its like asking a cat to guard a bowl of milk
5244165 but the farmer had also understood the character and conviction of this congress led upa government in these last 4 years and is desperate to throw them out of power the same way he was from his land

5244170 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5244171 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5244172 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5244173 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5244174 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5244175 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5244176 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5244177 as the western star recording company rolls into its 5th year as a label the momentum seems to have stepped up a few gears and things are really starting to get exciting
5244178 i am leaving with satisfaction that whatever i could do for this country i did that with honesty
5244179 i am a human too i could have made mistakes i believe that the people will forgive me and if there were any shortcomings or any mistakes they were unintentional

5244182 this is my ex wife treat the scene with respect
5244183 detectives if there was any reason to believe that this was a traumatic death and they stated no therefore the homicide suspicious death protocol was not followed
5244184 the protocol was not being followed because it was felt at that time by all parties that there were not signs of foul play or trauma for this death investigation
5244185 make observations and document those observations as part of their investigation and processing of a crime scene
5244186 when they bagged the hands that was when i asked the question you know do you think anything is out of whack here
5244187 bob deel was asked by me if he thought there was anything hinky here and stuff like that and if we should be doing something different and i was told no

5244201 people typically only think of a home inspection when they are either buying or selling
5244202 we can also help homeowners protect their home investment on an ongoing basis and potentially help decrease energy bills through annual maintenance inspections and home energy audits
5244203 maintenance inspections give the homeowners the information they need to make smart investments
5244204 im just relieved ill be able to get on the bus again
5244205 i phoned them up and they said theyd send one out to me to show drivers i think every mother who asks for one now will get one if they phone up
5244206 id like people to hand one to the driver of every bus they get on saying they object to this policy whether they push a buggy or not
5244207 its so intimidating waiting for a bus and then not knowing whether youll be allowed on or not
5244208 what are you supposed to do if youve got a six week old baby who cant go in a foldable buggy its not possible to carry your baby all the time
5244209 the last thing lothian buses should be doing is alienating so many passengers
5244210 i would definitely support this i think handing out cards is a good way for people to show lothian buses what they think
5244211 with a summer as bad as this one it is tempting to make the most of every moment the sun is out
5244212 during the summer holidays the desire to look brown will also encourage many young people to use sunbeds prior to soaking up the sun on the beach
5244213 instead of enhancing a persons looks sunbathing and using sunbeds regularly will actually damage them
5244214 they lead to premature aging by causing skin to lose its smooth supple texture and become coarse leathery and wrinkled
5244215 getting sunburnt is easy even in a summer as bad as this one but it can double your risk of skin cancer and yet many still believe that going red on the beach or in the back garden is all part of getting a tan
5244216 we did expect the figures to go down slightly as the purpose of the reforms was to take some cases like minor breaches of the peace and shoplifting and deal with them by fines
5244217 but what should then happen is the procurator fiscal has freed up time to deal with other cases instead were seeing those guilty of assault and caught by police never appearing in court
5244218 appearing in court with the evidence presented and the sheriff imposing a sentence is also part of the deterrent effect that is not replicated by posting a letter away to agree to a fine
5244219 its unacceptable that this soft touch scotland is allowed to continue
5244220 direct measures are not appropriate where prosecution would result in a sentence of imprisonment they are not an alternative to custody
5244221 police prosecutors and court staff have been working hard to implement the reforms which are beginning to tackle the significant problems faced under the old system where lengthy delays and repeated adjournments obstructed efficient effective justice caused added distress to victims and witnesses and left police languishing in court waiting rooms rather than in our communities
5244222 its a real disaster for us this is normally one of the busiest ranks in edinburgh but we are losing out on a lot of the short haul fares that we would normally get every morning from commuters going to work
5244223 people who would normally come out the station and get a taxi up to the office are choosing to walk because we cant go straight there and have to take a large detour
5244224 ive had several passengers who have been a little bit surprised that their fare is larger than normal because of the detour we have to take and theres no question that we will lose more business from this
5244225 it is all about forward planning and we have done a lot of work with lothian buses to make sure that they are aware of everything that is happening we have also tried to make sure the drivers know about the works and so will take any detours necessary obviously as time goes on more people will become aware of this

5244228 a large number of villages of these districts are completely marooned the standing crops houses school buildings hospital buildings and other community infrastructure had been badly affected uprooting a substantial rural population of the state from their respective homes the army is assisting civil administration in evacuating the affected persons
5244229 one of the major reasons for the floods has also been inadequate rehabilitation and strengthening of water resources infrastructure of the state namely dhussis bands canals minors distributaries river embankments etc most of this infrastructure is maintained by the state government though a substantial quantum of water goes to the neighhbouring state leaving punjab to suffer for being a riparian state we have time and again written to the ministry of water resources government of india to provide us requisite funds for rehabilitation and strengthening of water resources infrastructure and some of our major projects including the project for rehabilitation of major canals in the state relining of rajasthan canal relining of sirhind feeder canal and construction of shahpur kandi dam are pending with the ministry of water resources for a long time had these projects been cleared these would among other things have helped to attenuate floods as well
5244230 for the present situation we need to provide not only the immediate relief to the affected population till such time they are fully rehabilitated but we also need to compensate them for the loss of their livelihood as a result of damage to their standing crops i may mention here that the present norms of government of india to provide relief from the calamity relief fund crf neither provide sufficient relief nor do these fully compensate the affected persons these norms need to be reworked to ensure that the affected persons not only get immediate relief but they are also fully compensated for the loss they suffer
5244231 this race is a bit sad for me because we have the potential to do a lot better however considering what has happened this weekend and above all the problems with the front tyre i think we have done almost as much as we could
5244232 at the start i didnt want to take too many risks and i could feel that the front tyre was getting worse on each lap but on the other hand the rear tyre was getting better each lap i know that we have had had problems this weekend but i know that michelin are working very hard so now we will try to use the test to make some improvements

5244238 if all of human life is so precious to you why does our government led by your party fail to even count iraqi deaths in the current war
5244239 how much are we willing to really think through the issues
5244240 are we willing to grapple with complex questions or will we once again opt out for the simple answers that help us feel that life is not so hard after all

5244245 gordon has recently applied for early retirement having given 34 years of commitment and hard work which has helped to ensure the safety and welfare of edinburgh residents and visitors alike
5244246 we sincerely thank gordon for his decades of service and wish him all the best for the future his retirement is a personal choice and any rumours to the contrary are completely unfounded
5244247 this came as a real shock to everyone his staff had no idea until thursday there was a health and social care committee meeting last tuesday which he was at but there was no mention of his departure to councillors
5244248 there are some malicious rumours around but the truth is that gordon was told to take early retirement by senior directors
5244249 firefighters had to use lines and a harness for crew safety
5244250 they managed to secure a rescue line to the dog and the dog was then lifted to safety and returned to its grateful owner

5244252 the woman who went over the bonnet last year was thankfully unharmed she just dusted herself down and accepted the drivers apology
5244253 the boy who ran into the side of the fire engine about two years ago just wasnt looking where he was going
5244254 the one i did report recently was a near miss at holy corner there was a woman who had just managed to get her buggy on the pavement and was leading her older children along and she was just about to get on the pavement herself when she let out a loud scream as the car went past
5244255 i think the driver must have misjudged the distance and he gave her a terrible fright
5244256 im worried for everyone at that crossing because theres a chance they wont see me stopping the traffic and will hit someone on the way across
5244257 theres already a crossing at the junction of bruntsfield avenue and my personal opinion as a driver is that a second one could cause frustration
5244258 obviously my answer would be to put in more crossing guards at certain times of day as they can override the lights when the road is particularly busy but let traffic flow at other times but as usual there is very little money in the council budget to employ them
5244259 the list was ranked in order of priority based on environmental factors such as its proximity to schools and playgrounds but the top priority crossing isnt necessarily the one that will get put in first
5244260 in some cases while local groups may be calling for the crossing to be put in it may later be decided that the crossing is not appropriate for that area for other reasons
5244261 were more interested in validating who the person is rather than validating the ticket this is more scientific than registering for the gym or anything like that we would be 100 per cent confident that this would stamp out touting
5244262 this is stopping the problem of one person buying a vast array of tickets and selling them on you just cant do it
5244263 we want to grow this service and we will be looking at other large events that we can do this at
5244264 what is remarkable about tickall is that despite being a relatively new idea the system has worked operationally even in its early stages in the future ticket touts systems like tickall will be incredibly valuable and will help to protect genuine music fans

5244266 wed been using the old site every single day for over 20 years the rationale for moving us was to get more public use of that stretch of canal but all they did was demolish the huts and the site is still empty
5244267 youve got a pyramid of performance if you start with 100 people over a number of years some of them will give up others will be happy to be recreational canoeists if youve got 20 that are talented and very determined one or two of those might make the olympics and one might medal
5244268 it would be an awful lot easier if we had better facilities its very difficult to coach people with such minimal facilities we do the best that we can but were absolutely flat out on the canal
5244269 the forth canoe club was based at lochrin basin but with the development of edinburgh quay and continuing regeneration of the area this location was no longer suitable
5244270 the clubs new facility funded by british waterways scotland at harrison park is a more suitable location with easier access to the water at a wider part of the canal
5244271 a secure facility to store training equipment was also provided the canoeists are able to use the union canal in either direction from this location

5244298 i played against the ivorians many times during my days and i know how tough they always prove even though we scored many famous victories over them we are not going to take things easy
5244299 it is important for the boys to go into the match with a lot of seriousness and business like approach and avoid the little mistakes that can cost a team dearly at a stage like this
5244300 on the whole i have immense confidence in the team and with the prayer of all nigerians we should be singing victory song once again on saturday evening
5244301 prayer is gods invaluable privilege extended to man for us to maximize his purpose of creating us hence whenever we find ourselves in a situation when as his creations it is beyond our powers to resolve he is always ready if we call on him to intercede and take control
5244302 as we have come to this retreat ground in faith let us really open up to god in spirit and in truth so that our prayer sessions will yield the fruits of victory and security not only for our husbands fathers and uncles but our great nation too
5244303 call upon me in the day of trouble and i will answer and deliver you and you will glorify me
5244304 allah says in the holy quoran chapter 40 v 60
5244305 the implication of this is that if allah wont hear or listen to us he wont ask us to call on him and if he wont give unto us he wont ask us to request from him
5244306 god hears the unspoken words of our mouth as in the case of zakariah in quran chapter 19 v 2 3 you will understand the importance of this gathering if you appreciate the fact that if you point one finger of prayer at someone the remaining fingers are pointed a you
5244307 the level of insecurity is alarming and there is a general decline in infrastructural services our leaders are doing their best to put things in order for the general good of all of us we realize they need our support cooperation and prayers to succeed
5244308 we must therefore assist them and assist ourselves with prayers because there is nothing impossible with prayers
5244309 as concerned mothers we must sit down to pray for our nation our husbands leaders and ourselves the challenges of leadership are enormous hence this retreat seeks divine help for all concerned to chart a new course for our re orientation and progress as a nation
5244310 father you are the only one that can deliver us from

5244314 british high commissioner to nigeria bob dewar represented the uk at the ceremony in calabar on 14 august which transferred authority in the bakassi peninsula
5244315 we congratulate the government of nigeria and cameroun for giving in this way an important example to the rest of the world of the peaceful settlement of differences in accordance with international law

5244327 the growth since the previous trading statement has primarily been driven by stronger than anticipated operational performance of the shipping division and a ship sale originally contracted for the second half of the year has been concluded in the first half
5244328 in an increasing number of cases retrospective amendments appear to have been prompted by nothing more than the fact that the south african revenue service sars and treasury have decided in hindsight that they do not like a particular result
5244329 these changes have been imposed with retrospective effect often extending back over several years
5244330 it is the lack of respect for the rule of law a founding principle enshrined in the constitution
5244331 where there were changes which were beneficial to business there were usually no complaints
5244332 even in those cases we had not made the law retrospective

5244336 it is a shame for a high literacy state like kerala that these unmarried tribal women continue to live in a state of penury and neglect years after their problems came into public attention
5244337 wayand is a punishment posting for every policeman his job commitment is low he does not view the adivasi problem with any degree of seriousness
5244338 even if cases of sexual exploitation can be settled by giving money a living child born out of such relationship will pose a constant threat hence they resort to brutal methods of eliminating newborn infants
5244339 we visit almost all the hamlets to collect information about the problems facing them we also help abused women to lodge a complaint with the police and to seek government aid
5244340 our main goal is to make minor girls aware about the possible traps laid by people from outside we will not allow the number of unwed mothers to increase
5244341 much of the problem seems to stem from the increasing alienation of their land and shrinking the traditional sources of income leaving them at the mercy of the greedy settlers from outside their tribal heritage does not equip tribal groups to resist exploitation by outsiders over the decades they have been swarmed by hordes of settlers who addicted them to alcohol dispossessed them of their lands and sexually abused their women
5244342 earlier children had to walk to the nearest high school 32 km away now it is 22 km away there was no up gradation for the local tribal primary school however the number of resorts is steadily increasing
5244343 we are at pains to understand why the minister of state for petroleum mr odein ajumogobia should reduce a serious issue to simple minded declarations only the minister probably believes that inflicting higher fuel prices would not hurt the poor and that the government is merely subsidising the rich car owners the whole essence of the nlcs opposition to fuel price increases is its negative impact on the people especially the poor who constitute more than 70 of the population it is fraudulent for the minister and other agents of government to insist that the subsidy is largely for the rich car owners given the absence of alternative modes of transportation nigeria still relies almost exclusively on road transportation to move people and goods therefore high costs of fuel affect everybody especially the poor as demonstrated in the past costs of transport instantaneously rose by wide margins following any increases in fuel prices this shows that the effect is general and bites harder on workers peasants students and other disadvantaged nigerians similarly previous price increases have led to immediate astronomical increases in the prices of other commodities and services especially house rent food and basic consumer items such previous increases had led to severe erosion in the value of wages and deepened the poverty situation of the people what has happened today to the price of diesel is a demonstration of the severe crisis that will be inflicted on the people if the minister were to carry through this threat in relation to petrol what nigerians expect is that government will intervene even on diesel to bring it under the same arrangement with petrol in order to guarantee stability
5244344 government needs to advert attention to the high cost of doing business which higher fuel prices will inflict on the economy for us in the nlc one of the most fundamental challenges of governance today is to make the operating environment more favourable for productive activities with mr ajumogobias scenario the operating environment will become harsher while more businesses will fold up and send more nigerians out of employment any government that is incapable of appreciating this is certainly a liability to the development process it is also important to insist that the minister of state for petroleum should tell the nation the steps government has taken to revive the four refineries ultimately the real challenge is to develop sustainable capacity for domestic refining of petroleum products build new refineries and create conditions for bringing other players into the domestic refining stream over the last one year the nlc has made sustained efforts towards dialogue with the federal government on issues pertaining to pricing and availability of petroleum products the ideas was that we could take advantage of the moratorium on pricing to address ways to get the country out of the vicious cycle of crisis associated with pricing
5244345 indeed based on the directive of mr president an exploratory meeting between the current minister of state for petroleum and the nlc did agree on modalities for a stakeholders forum which the federal government was expected to convene unfortunately the recent statements by the minister indicate utter bad faith unwillingness to live up to commitments and aversion to dialogue on the part of the federal government the nlc strongly condemns this degeneration to the deceit ambush and pointless belligerence employed by the previous administration the nlc is calling on president umaru musa yaradua to ensure that the federal government returns to the table on this matter in good faith and without pre empting the outcome of dialogue
5244346 we also urge the president to spare the nation the cycle of arbitrary fuel price increases and bitter confrontations between government and the people in addition mr president should call the petroleum minister to order

5244453 i was very aggressive throwing the first pitch for strikes
5244454 that allowed me to go out there for the ninth i was just doing my job
5244455 without question this was his best outing of the year it probably was the second best outing ive ever seen him throw after the nlcs playoff game in 2005
5244456 every one of us on the starting staff tries to put up good innings and quality starts and hope for the best
5244457 we have been able to do that but unfortunately it hasnt gone my way thats baseball

5244514 manchester has such a strong fashion heritage it needs to be a real celebration and not just a roll out of catwalk shows
5244515 you just have to look around the city to see how many different looks are going on
5244516 its fantastic and its why we need a great event to represent it but it also means that with manchester in fashion we cant just create a single event that caters for everyone
5244517 this is why the labels we are getting involved will range from high end designer to urban and local fashion there will be numerous price points from 10 to hundreds of pounds so it doesnt matter if you are a label lover a high street devotee or you like your independent fashion there is going to be something for everyone

5244520 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5244521 she met lindsay in the summer of 2006 at a party in malibu from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
5244522 back then samantha and lindsay didnt have a physical relationship
5244523 she once said samanthas the father i never had apparently samantha acted in a paternal way towards her giving her advice and cuddles
5244524 courtenay still cant understand how lindsay is now so open with samantha every time she sees a picture of them together it kills her

5244568 it may increase the likelihood that people will become transsexual
5244569 the present study found that a mutant gene that ultimately results in higher testosterone levels is overrepresented in female to male transsexualism says mikael land n of the karolinska institute in stockholm sweden
5244570 this is in line with what we previously know about masculinisation of the brain and is therefore less likely to be a chance finding
5244571 hence the study is important and adds to the notion that gender identity is influenced by sex hormones early in life and that certain gene combinations make individuals more vulnerable to aberrant effects

5244670 we have our first million euros and have 29 homes under way in all five districts homes that qualified under the old criteria of people that owned their homes before the hurricane and they were damaged or destroyed
5244671 we have about 19 others still under the old criteria
5244672 and then we will start on people who were in rented housing that was adversely affected by the hurricane
5244673 a lot of people most of them caymanian and is a measurable percentage of the islands population
5244674 well soon start with people who were adversely affected by the hurricane in rental housing and then a government committee will make recommendations for people in trailers and nhdt national housing development trust housing
5244675 we are going to be building on about eight and a half acres maybe nine acres in east end then in bodden town and george town very possibly on the land where our nrf headquarters are
5244676 and then there are bits and pieces like architectural fees planning costs that sort of thing probably making our total closer to 60 homes
5244677 well be building the lowest of the low income homes while the nhdt will handle the more modest low income homes
5244678 depending on the number of lots and roughly speaking about 60 in george town 40 in west bay and equal numbers in east end and bodden town making a total of about 150 maybe 200 homes
5244679 some of those eu funds allow homes to be built but they cannot be purchased and that is where the nhdt comes in
5244680 if it costs 100 000 to build a home that is what the mortgage will be
5244681 they smashed up the glass in the front door but i was able to replace it so i wont have to sleep in the store to protect my business

5244683 but there wasnt anything in there to get im thankful they didnt trash the place and didnt bother with the computers
5244684 they hacked at the doors but the glass wasnt even broken
5244685 it is safe to say that this hasnt happened before
5244686 clearly this is not a target against one business but more of a random attack on several
5244687 it is possible that the culprit or culprits were under the impression that security alarms would not go off due to the earlier power cut however almost all security systems have a back up system for power outage situations

5244690 the initial discussions on the development of berthing facilities for grand cayman took place during the florida caribbean cruise association annual conference in st kitts in 2005
5244691 during that conference i had a discussion with mr bodden to advise him that the government had adopted a policy to establish cruise berthing facilities in grand cayman and that i felt it prudent and fair to notify him of this at the earliest opportunity this would allow him to begin to prepare for reduced demand for tendering
5244692 at no time did the owners mr bodden or mr adrian briggs have formal discussions with the minister in st kitts regarding berthing facilities in cayman
5244693 using those tenders as water taxis to take tourists to other locations around the island
5244694 and were not going to leave them out of our discussions
5244695 as i said during the press conference to announce the mou the government is committed to working with the owners operators of the tendering service to help them make the transition from a tendering service to a combination of tendering and other services which are perhaps more lucrative such as water taxis and sea tours
5244696 mr bodden is denying that i met with him in st kitts
5244697 his disappointment that mr atlee bodden would deny having had a discussion on the proposed introduction of berthing during the fcca conference in st kitts in 2005
5244698 the minister further said he trusts mr bodden wont deny his having reiterated the governments intentions to establish berthing facilities during the fcca conference hosted by the cayman islands in 2006 and on many occasions in the media since then
5244699 the governments offer remains to work with mr bodden to transition his business activities whenever berthing facilities are introduced
5244700 there are hundreds of jobs and small businesses which stand to lose their livelihoods if the cruise sector is allowed to stagnate due to our infrastructure not keeping pace with developments in the industry
5244701 clearly the welfare of many must take precedent change will also present new opportunities
5244702 i took the step of highlighting how this cruise tendering business which will be most directly impacted by the introduction of berthing facilities might work with the industry to prepare for and benefit from the necessary infrastructure enhancements
5244703 whether mr bodden wants to acknowledge this spirit of cooperation some three years ago i trust he will do so now

5244733 its a rare treat to see these people in action the racing at coronet peak over the next couple of weeks gives spectators the chance to feel the excitement of international ski racing
5244734 the presence of the international teams also provides a fantastic opportunity for the new zealand team which is also based at coronet peak
5244735 the presence of some of the top skiers in the world gives the new zealanders a measure for their own performances and the opportunity to improve their fis ratings
5244736 the concept of holding a night slalom is fantastic for both the competitors and spectators
5244737 extra lighting is being installed and it will be integrated with existing lighting to ensure the course is adequately lit it will be a unique event
5244738 we are expecting several slalom skiers ranked in the top 30 in the world to compete in the mens field which is huge for the new zealand event
5244739 in the womens field there will also be some highly ranked skiers training in the area who are expected to enter and help lower the penalty
5244740 im convinced its possible to find palestinian prisoners with blood on their hands that have not killed israelis or other nationals
5244741 when israel releases prisoners to weak political players making no demand in return these players remain weak this decision sends out a message of weakness and of coming to terms with the existing situation why are we helping abu mazen abbas instead of first ensuring that gilad schalit is free
5244742 i do not believe in useless gestures i believe in trust building gestures that lead to results on the ground and that cant be said about the release of these prisoners in order to achieve our goal which is security we must engage in negotiations that yield results and in which our demands are met
5244743 this is a gesture to abu mazen and the palestinian people for the upcoming month of ramadan
5244744 strengthen the peace process and moderate palestinians and to demonstrate clearly that the path of moderation and the path of negotiations is the path that can deliver results
5244745 when israel releases prisoners only to groups that exert force it sends out the message that it gives in to pressure and that the use of violence and kidnapping are effective ways of acting against israel
5244746 theyve uplifted my soul theyve done everything ive asked of them the choir im going to save tonight is revelation
5244747 because they sang to their real strengths and because they really moved me tonight im going to vote for revelation
5244748 it was very close for me i thought they were both fantastic it was a level playing field but i think they just scraped through on penalties it was revelation for me as well
5244749 i thought that it was better but id still like a bit more passion i was only really getting it from the front row just because youre not in the front row doesnt mean that you dont give it your all but still a great sound guys
5244750 well what i got this week which i didnt get in the previous weeks was a depth of sound and definitely some subtleties coming into your singing so a step upwards in that respect
5244751 my problem with that was it was flat and i think it was a bad arrangement it was thin there were places where the cording was ok but on the whole i think it was a very unfortunate arrangement and the tuning suffered throughout
5244752 i have to agree with suzi the tuning in that was so dodgy the solo god bless you it wasnt a great solo when the guys came in the entrance from under the solo was messy it just wasnt happening this week guys
5244753 you know that ive been a big supporter of you from the start i dont want your wall of sound to crumble get back to where you started i want to hear that big five geared machine that i know youve got

5244755 from what i know this is the first season sunset have put on a six a side we came up with the idea as a nice way to get the footballing community on the island together to raise some money for charity and to raise some money for our senior men and womans teams and our youth teams
5244756 the rules will be coming out shortly standard six a side rules adapted for our fields well split camana bay into two and create two pitches out of that the field is large so it probably wont be a full half maybe only from one side of the 18 yard box to the other
5244757 we probably wont be putting team names on the shirts due to not having enough time to get them printed prior to the tournament however if we get all the spots filled soon we may be able to do this
5244758 we could not have left out our youth from this fantastic opportunity as such the kids clinic was specially formed to give our young girls and boys the chance to show their skills and learn from the best our own cayman islands senior national football team
5244759 at the heart of our portal is that you can get a lot of information from the community
5244760 theres been user generated content in investing for a long time but its been in the form of discussion boards
5244761 with discussion boards things tend to fall off the bottom of the page and theres little incentive to make a really good post our site gives people a platform where they can share their knowledge
5244762 weve put in mechanisms to help prevent stuff like that
5244763 people are encouraged to build a long term reputation on the site
5244764 the only people who bother to spend a lot of time writing are the people who actually know something about the topic
5244765 i was frustrated that the personal finance blogosphere didnt really have a center spot
5244766 so i began putting together a catalog of personal finance blogs with listings by topic i came up with a framework that i hoped would make it easier for readers to find out the main theme of a blog i gave the opportunity for people to list their main topics give a summary of their blogs purpose and their views and even link to their best posts i hoped that this would be useful for readers to find blogs which fit what they were looking for and that bloggers would be willing to participate because it was free advertising
5244767 now that the former part is doing well id like to get more personal finance information itself on the site
5244768 sort of a stage two what are index funds what is a 401 k
5244769 i think its currently unique for its focus on the blogosphere for both bloggers and readers
5244770 there are lots of great finance facts in for example but nothing ive seen about personal finance blogs accumulating finance information is only one of the finwikians goals the main goal being to link people to sites which will provide them a more daily dose if they subscribe
5244771 people like to have a voice and they like flexibility
5244772 nothing is static on a wiki you can add your own blog listing or point of view to a topic then readers like to be able to find information quickly i hope people like this one because it helps them find useful information even if thats not on the wiki itself

5244797 the tone and content of their recommendations will no doubt lead to a more onerous and rigorous environment for financial institutions whilst banks operating in so called secrecy jurisdictions may lose one of their strongest selling points
5244798 the ramifications for all offshore financial institutions may be significant particularly in jurisdictions which like switzerland have banking secrecy laws rather than the more widely accepted rules on banking confidentiality

5244800 its always been a policy to offer as many varied services as we possibly can including legal corporate compliance and immigration services however the one component that has been missing until now is the ability to offer our services to the offshore financial community

5244851 this was a tragic incident a family member can never be replaced and it is always painful when civilians particularly women and children are involved
5244852 while it is unclear exactly what caused their death an investigation is under way what is clear is that taliban fighters were in the area and showed a total disregard for the presence of civilians near them

5244898 i think some companies will say blasphemy to this but not everyone is going to need a blackberry not everyone is going to need an iphone not everyone is going to need a palm treo
5244899 if a smart phone or a regular cellphone didnt make phone calls or didnt make phone calls well people would just switch their phones and say i am getting something else mainly because thats the intended purpose
5244900 obviously because canadians are such high users of voice its a pretty good indicator that we do like to talk

5244913 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be
5244914 and will encourage him to come back to the track
5244915 but they will understand when somebody has an accident you cant help it

5244924 i say 100 times my family is happy here we want to win trophies at this club because it is a massive club
5244925 if we have problems because we are not doing things which in my opinion as a manager we could do i will work as hard as i can for the club
5244926 i do have some disappointment because we do not always have the same ideas but it doesnt matter because i will continue to fight
5244927 its going to be a long hard season and were expecting a tough fight against relegation
5244928 i cant repeat what i said at half time but i lost my rag because we were losing battles all over the pitch
5244929 it was powder puff stuff and im still angry now at what i saw in that first half but at least i got a response
5244930 i told the lads if a manager had said the same to me during my playing career i would have done everything possible in the second half to ram the words down his throat
5244931 it was not a bad day overall for us we did not play that well and we came away with a good point
5244932 doncaster are a team who are flying high they have a winning mentality after coming up last year it was a tough game
5244933 we gave away a poor goal from our point of view but you dont point fingers we have to take responsibility as a back four
5244934 it is not like teams are opening us up and tearing us apart and that we are not good enough

5244940 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5244941 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation

5244943 we prefer not to sign exclusive deals with artists because while it seems like the competitive business thing to do in the long run its really not good for anyone

5244956 there have been instances when the noise of the market became more than office workers could cope with
5244957 we havent banned the market sellers from shouting at any time we have just asked them to quiten down
5244958 we appreciate calling is an important part of their trade but we dont think the restriction will affect everyday trading
5244959 if we cant attract customers particularly in winter then im worried the stall might not survive
5244960 the traders cries are part of the colour of the market they put on a fabulous display even though not enough people come here any more
5244961 we had to agree with people working in the area that on some occasions this has gone beyond what is felt to be reasonable
5244962 we talked directly to the traders about this on a number of occasions before sending a letter which is not asking them to stop calling but to reduce the volume and frequency of the calling

5244987 this is the sort of consolidation i believe we will see more of in the future across the aids sector
5244988 understanding and being committed to greater impact requires ngos and other types of organisations to honestly examine how they can be most effective
5244989 the alliance and hdn see this ambition as more important than preserving established organisational identities
5244990 this shifting environment means organisations need to adopt higher standards of accountability respond to stricter reporting requirements and communicate better with critical and well informed stakeholders the planned joint organisation will strive to develop a reputation for transparency and providing reliable information about its work

5244998 general practitioners play a fundamental and vital role in the health of the nation
5244999 clearly patients want to see a gp when they are sick
5245000 to give patients better access to gp services gp training numbers need to be lifted and support for gp practice nurses must be expanded to general practices across the country
5245001 this new research clearly shows that patients trust and value their gps and that general practitioners should remain responsible for the overall management of a patients care working collaboratively with other primary health care professionals

5245017 we expect these awards to play a significant role in changing the career trajectory of funded researchers encouraging talented young investigators to pursue careers in stem cell research

5245023 the degree to which the drugs can prevent infections has proved highly contentious
5245024 it just doesnt seem like a cautious public health recommendation

5245040 the american physical society the leading professional society for american physicists announced in july 2008 on one of its websites that there is a considerable presence within the scientific community of people who do not agree with the ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change conclusion that anthropogenic co2 emissions are very probably likely to be primarily responsible for the global warming that has occurred since the industrial revolution
5245041 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gases is causing or will cause in the future catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
5245042 the so called hockey stick graph to support the notion that humans are causing global warming
5245043 to slow stop and even reverse the damage of greenhouse gases
5245044 the science is overwhelming climate change is happening now and human activity is the primary cause
5245045 by now the dynamics of global warming are widely known and we find no reason to dispute the scientific assumptions
5245046 its not appropriate for companies to say the debate is over and the case is closed when it is becoming more apparent all the time that climatologists have no firm idea about what drives warming and cooling cycles
5245047 we think statements of certainly about climate are actually misstatements
5245048 companies have an obligation under current law to refrain from making false and misleading statements on material matters and the sec has been pretty strict about this
5245049 yet when you get into global warming issues its almost like they the corporations have the environmentalists writing propaganda for them
5245050 exelon believes that climate change is real and that action is needed to immediately reverse greenhouse gas emissions ghgs we are already among the lowest carbon emitters in the utility industry by virtue of our nuclear fleet and this year we are on track to meet our voluntary commitment to reduce our carbon emissions by 8 percent as part of epas climate leaders program exelons industry leading low carbon strategy seeks to reduce displace or offset 15 million metric tons of ghgs by 2020 this is more than our current annual carbon footprint

5245053 the ceos have not thought through all of the consequences of global warming regulations on their business
5245054 it means more unemployment higher energy prices and lower gdp gross domestic product and theyre actually lobbying for this
5245055 so long as corporate leaders can insulate their own lifestyles and score public relations points they will continue to embrace green schemes that seek to mollify activists at the expense of investors
5245056 the sad reality is corporate america now leans left and is a major funding source for pro regulatory lawmakers
5245057 greater vigilance is needed on the part of shareholders to safeguard profitable enterprises that would otherwise succumb to costly political endeavors
5245058 oil supply to the chemical industry and other markets is enough and high oil prices are not due to a shortage of crude but rather it is because of the decrease in the dollars value shortage of refinery capacity and some political tensions in the world
5245059 opec is not under any pressure to raise crude output

5245061 i felt it myself i felt that the atmosphere suddenly changed and for those 27 or 28 minutes all the leaders of the world did not blink when i say they didnt move an eyelid im not exaggerating they were looking as if a hand was holding them there and had just opened their eyes to the message of the islamic republic

5245064 as one of the worlds most dynamic economies whose gdp surged to us 53 9 billion last year and with an annual average growth rate of some eight per cent dubai continues to serve as a model for development and diversification
5245065 reducing our dependence on hydrocarbons which now account for less than five per cent of gdp while simultaneously encouraging new public private partnerships and creating vast numbers of new employment opportunities the emirate is an inspiration to the region and indeed the wider global community
5245066 under the guidance of his highness sheikh mohammed bin rashid al maktoum vice president and prime minister of the uae and ruler of dubai the emirate has been transformed into a full and leading participant in the global economy
5245067 as outlined in his highnesss dubai strategic plan 2015 the emirate aims to increase productivity by four per cent annually while raising its gdp to some us 108 billion and increasing per capita gdp to us 44 000 by 2015
5245068 during this period of sustained economic growth development and diversification the government of dubai also continues to recognise the importance of demonstrating to the regional and international community the emirates ongoing commitment to good governance and its upholding of the highest regulatory standards
5245069 at the investment corporation of dubai whose portfolio includes all of the emirates wholly or partly owned government businesses we fully support this drive to ensure the highest levels of corporate governance and transparency
5245070 focused on both local and international opportunities icd manages its own portfolio of assets in line with such global standards and we encourage all entities in the emirate both public and private to share our commitment to these principles today and into the future

5245073 no human life is worth more than another and no human life is worth less than another if we truly believe that then we have to stand up unapologetically for life against this wholesale destruction
5245074 we should never forget that the manner in which we treat others is the manner in which we invite others to treat us
5245075 if we are a society that makes it ok to slaughter innocent life and vulnerable life we are in essence inviting others to feel that way toward us thats why this issue has never been a political one for me
5245076 go down to the mall and look at any of the monuments and you will see that they the founders often spoke of providence
5245077 there has been a rewriting of history to pretend this isnt true
5245078 we would not have as much strength force and vitality without roman catholics
5245079 save afghan lives defeating the enemies plan to discredit the afghan government
5245080 we recommend to all afghans to be vigilant at large public events and other locations where crowds gather and report suspicious behavior to security forces
5245081 all the time the enemy tries to carry out any kind of activity that it can but the afghan security forces are ready and we have already taken measures to disrupt any enemy activity
5245082 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5245083 we are waiting for them to come back with the law in english
5245084 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5245085 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission

5245087 unfortunately we see no signs that the russians are starting to pull out or even preparing to withdraw from georgia
5245088 if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished we will never allow this if anyone tries this again we will come out with a crushing response
5245089 we have all the necessary resources political economic and military if anyone had any illusions about this they have to abandon them
5245090 our estimate does not confirm the official figure we believe we are talking about dozens rather than thousands
5245091 we have a rough estimate based on hospital figures and eyewitness testimony in the worst affected areas we keep hearing official statements of several thousands dead and this is not serious and is irresponsible it does not help to bring clarity to what happened there and bring justice to the victims

5245096 a lot of evils been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil
5245097 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests

5245112 when i saw the georgian flag i remembered a scene in rocky and i decided to show it after the win
5245113 it is a really messy picture at the moment and the next 48 hours will be very unsettled
5245114 there is an area of deep low pressure and the centre of it is the south west coast of ireland tomorrow it will move over to northern england so that area can expect heavy rain
5245115 bands of rains and showers will continue from there but it will get calmer as the week progresses
5245116 by wednesday we should see more sunshine as the low pressure moves away and the wind dies down

5245121 when does the attack rise to the level of a use of force under international law
5245122 his campaign was consistently vague and slow to react in their reaction to the russian invasion it is clear that obama is within the mainstream of berkeley calif in terms of the security and defense issues that concern the american voters
5245123 george bushs foreign policy has failed across the board and especially in containing russia weve tried to befriend russia and it hasnt worked
5245124 we need someone to come to washington and have a fresh and new look something different than the bush mccain administrations
5245125 john mccain has been right about russia more than this president has and more than senator obama
5245126 the closer margin seen in todays results is due more to movement away from obama than toward mccain
5245127 mccain is garnering more support from his base including republicans and white evangelical protestants and he also has steadily gained backing from white working class voters over this period
5245128 now see him as the candidate who would use the best judgment in a crisis and an increasing percentage see him as the candidate who can get things done
5245129 these are still the dog days of summer and we still see 10 percent to 15 percent of the voters havent made up their minds yet and are not likely to pay attention until september or october
5245130 the republicans have nominated a good candidate but obama still has time to define himself
5245131 there could be some supply disruption issues there so the market is watching this closely
5245132 the market will probably get through this hurricane news pretty quickly
5245133 the number one story in global assets is for now the rise of the dollar index
5245134 since it was a key market input for the upward move of crude oil any further rise in the dollar index should further limit the upside potential for oil
5245135 the honour and dignity of the country will be affected and in my view the honour of the office of president will also be affected
5245136 i dont want anything from anybody i have no interest i leave my future in the hands of the nation and people
5245137 it eliminates all the uncertainty in the market and i think the political uncertainty is coming to an end
5245138 the government will hopefully start concentrating on the economy from an economic point of view they have no excuses now and they have to perform
5245139 thank god hes resigned the country will do much better now its a victory for the people
5245140 its a victory for all democratic forces and its victory for benazir bhutto and all those who sacrificed their lives for democracy
5245141 we need verification of withdrawal and cease fire preferably by eu and osce monitors we need humanitarian aid reaching everybody and then in the end we need peacekeepers taking over conflict areas and doing genuine post conflict resolution in the interest of all ethnic groups

5245197 samir looks intelligent and capable of having good acceleration he sees a good vision of the game and that left flank suits him quite well maybe there is a bit of robert pires in him because he looks to be able to change direction very easily and a little bit the same style of run he is a bit smaller but theres a bit of pires in there

5245309 he wanted to serve the country and to be different
5245310 he brought parliamentary reforms he brought women into the parliament
5245311 he in a way always believed in a unity of command a very centralized command which means his command in fact
5245312 this is where he went wrong and he underestimated the value of democracy

5245383 dit is een objectief en betrouwbaar onderzoek de resultaten gelden niet alleen voor marktplaats maar voor alle handelsplaatsen in nederland
5245384 in de vergelijking met de omzet bij webwinkels is het belangrijk om te onderscheiden dat webwinkels transactioneel van aard zijn en handelsplaatsen door consumenten worden gebruikt om zich te ori nt ren
5245385 door de combinatie met thuiswinkel org kunnen dan ook onderzoeken of er substitutie plaatsvindt en of er andere onderlinge effecten tussen handelssites en webwinkels zijn

5245393 well maybe they married men who made them end up like this
5245394 it seems fitting that ben van berkels first major american building will be completed at the moment when new york city celebrates the 400th anniversary of the original dutch settlement of manhattan
5245395 ben has a pioneering daring spirit a global vision that we share
5245396 the building sits at the edge of the tribeca historic district so that low lying structures fan out beneath it to the west and create amazing vistas
5245397 on the lower floors where there is a need to maximize daylight we have specified the lightest coloured floors and fixtures and wall colors throughout
5245398 i cannot forget how the whole country was passionately behind bafana resulting in us winning the african nations cup in 1996 the fans stood behind us and it was wonderful i therefore urge the whole country to rally behind the team the same way they did for us
5245399 we must have faith in the team despite their form we should show them we have the belief in them just as the nation did when we won the tournament
5245400 in the short term markets could trade in range but around october november there may be change in investor sentiments crude may be down but monsoon has changed in last 15 days for better inflation will peak out and all these things will positively impact the market
5245401 the 3g purchase orders pos issued earlier by the circles of north and east zones were kept in abeyance because of non availability of 3g spectrum as the 3g spectrum has now been allocated to bsnl the 3g pos will become effective from the date of issuance of this letter august 11 2008
5245402 id like to categorically state that we are not pursuing hummer
5245403 at the auto expo in delhi earlier this year we have showcased our strength as the green warrior and we have no intention to tarnish that image
5245404 we have some issues with chrysler over the grill design of scorpio but we are confident that there is absolutely no infringement of any intellectual property
5245405 as business confidence continues to remain strong the private corporate investment in 2008 09 is likely to increase although it may grow at a slower pace
5245406 which began in 2002 03 and maintained healthy thereafter is expected to be sustained in 2008 09
5245407 the domestic demand is still resilient and supporting overall economic growth driving corporates to continue their expansion plans at the back of rising capacity constraints
5245408 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5245409 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5245410 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5245411 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5245412 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5245413 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5245414 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5245415 our research was a result of our desire to provide data about the effectiveness of those new standards to our clients and partners and to lay a foundation for future research initiatives to build and expand upon

5245419 assured that georgians would not continue to use military force
5245420 if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq for example the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5245421 mounting evidence that russian and georgian military used armed force unlawfully during the south ossetian conflict
5245422 highlights the need for international fact finding missions in georgia
5245423 ongoing militia attacks and a growing humanitarian crisis also indicate the urgent need for the deployment of a mission to enhance civilian protection
5245424 an international security mission should be deployed to help protect civilians and create a safe environment for the displaced to return home
5245425 and international organizations should also send fact finding missions to establish the facts report on human rights and urge the authorities to account for any crimes
5245426 deploy a robust european defense agency mission consisting of police and security forces to ensure protection of civilians and the return of displaced persons to their homes

5245433 there has been a lot of speculation i want to say categorically we are not pursuing hummer
5245434 we are pursuing our own models strategy and we do not want to tarnish our lean warrior strategy
5245435 the formation of this joint venture is a significant step in our plans for the china market
5245436 along with our current operations we will have a much larger scale and a cost effective manufacturing base on which to build up our business in china and for overseas markets
5245437 for a long time the mahindra group has aspired to become the no 1 tractor manufacturer in the world
5245438 i believe with our new alliance we would be able to achieve that goal more rapidly
5245439 most of the gold price movement is strongly correlated with what is happening in the u s dollar
5245440 one thing that is keeping gold prices under pressure is the view that the dollar is going to be stronger going forward
5245441 we are going to see a further retracement in the gold market in particular on dollar strength
5245442 even though the dollar has already made quite a large movement people are predicting dollar strength will be the subject going forward
5245443 i am a nice friendly guy feel free to approach me
5245444 those who speak do not know and those who know do not speak
5245445 we decided we wanted to enhance our ability to notify the public
5245446 we found that the alert monitors worked well and that integrating it into a pa system would enhance our ability to notify the public
5245447 we think theyll notice the emergency situations more now because theyll hear it throughout their residence halls and academic buildings
5245448 the university has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to enable us to respond and react as well as possible to an emergency
5245449 there are a lot of relatively new safety measures now that didnt exist at the beginning of last school year and were excited
5245450 part of our job is to make students better consumers of their own education
5245451 we help students become acquainted with other resources on campus
5245452 freshmen know they will be challenged academically but they dont know what direction that challenge will take
5245453 if youre having trouble odds are you arent the only one
5245454 if youve exhausted all those possibilities by the end of the 10 weeks i would strongly recommend dropping the course
5245455 it is good for freshmen to know the opportunities available to them and more knowledge is never a bad thing
5245456 just be careful to check and double check your information
5245457 the door is open to all students regardless of their ability to pay
5245458 as long as you are a student you are eligible to receive health care at the health center
5245459 by paying a general fee and tuition students are eligible to come to the health center
5245460 if a student is able to demonstrate financial need we can on a sliding scale reduce payment to a self pay rate
5245461 we will never deny anyone service for an inability to pay
5245462 based on student feedback from students with university health insurance reeves was able to negotiate a 250 increase for prescription coverage
5245463 sometimes it is less expensive for the student to use his or her prescription card at another pharmacy
5245464 the psychology department is planning on developing a mens group for the fall
5245465 on average only 2 6 students would come to the health center on saturday
5245466 that wasnt enough to offset the expense of having a full staff scheduled
5245467 we took into consideration students becoming ill over the weekend and staying open thursday evening would benefit the students before they left campus for the weekend
5245468 we chose university hospitals because they have had for years a very successful 24 hour nurse call line and they have all the protocols in place
5245469 the accreditation certificate is a symbol that an organization is committed to providing high quality health care and that it has demonstrated that commitment by measuring up to the accreditation associations high standards
5245470 be clean and tidy or else the bugs will move in
5245471 i didnt want to make her my roommate feel bad so if anything bothered me i would never mention it
5245472 looking back on it i realized if i would have asked her to change things it wouldnt have been as scary as i thought
5245473 she probably didnt like some things that i did either
5245474 we kept our room a her half my half deal
5245475 ras are also students who go to class take tests and have social lives
5245476 the system is set up to supplement or augment what students learn in the classroom
5245477 sometimes i didnt see my roommates for days but they would come in see the note and know what was going on
5245478 i found that it was very easy for me to become secluded and lose that strong connection with the ksu campus and the sense of community i felt while living in the dorms once i moved off campus
5245479 if youre a commuter you do not have the same luxury as someone who lives on campus who always knows whats going on
5245480 there are more than 200 student organizations here at kent state and if you get involved youre going to meet people
5245481 it makes the entire college experience so much more worthwhile and all of these opportunities are readily available to those willing to explore them
5245482 we can do lots of different things you can be an artist and a psychologist you can be a scientist and religious you can be a sports enthusiast and a scholar
5245483 to create well rounded individuals who are not unidimensional who can see the world through different lenses
5245484 use every elective youve got to take courses in music and theater and religion
5245485 you will never have another opportunity to have so much expertise in so many fields available to you it will open your mind
5245486 the first year maybe year and a half you can do a lot of exploration
5245487 but you need to begin to focus in most students arent in a situation where they can be on the six year plan or the seven year plan
5245488 i took general education courses and then i took english and psychology and sociology and then i discovered anthropology and that became my passion
5245489 i went to rod stewart concerts buffy sainte marie judy collins
5245490 you can certainly often go hear a lecture or go hear a performance
5245491 the other side of that is if youre a student most of you have more free time than you did during your high school experience figure out a way to give something back do something volunteering wise
5245492 is to think about developing consistent study skills and stress management skills its a big year in peoples lives there are lots of changes
5245493 as you go through the education process you have to realize that you are learning skills
5245494 some of which are transferable to whatever it is you may decide you want to become if you change your mind about what it is you think you want to become now
5245495 take an art course take something you wouldnt normally try nows the time to do it because once you get out into the real working world there arent as many opportunities for that
5245496 its really important for students to orient themselves to the campus and all available services
5245497 freshmen should put 911 on their speed dial and use common sense when out at night
5245498 the escort service is a great program to help students get around at night
5245499 anyone can use it and its a great way for students to be safe
5245500 well be there as soon as we can and take you wherever you need to go were here to make sure youre safe
5245501 at night students should stick to the campus walkways and well lit areas
5245502 taking shortcuts or going through the bushes can be dangerous and you could get lost or hurt that way
5245503 officers are out at night on foot to help students be safe
5245504 if anyone needs help or directions were out and you can stop us
5245505 you need to know this if you ever want to succeed in college
5245506 youre never going to make it through college alive so dont even try muahaha
5245507 if i dont make it at least ill go down having given my best
5245508 huh maybe this college thing isnt as bad as everyone says
5245509 the cost is a big jump from sorority to sorority
5245510 your kids will be coloring on the floor while you oblivious to it all try to assess the damage done to the turkey after accidentally burning it in the oven
5245511 when students first come to campus joining an organization is a great way for them to meet people
5245512 they then can opt in or opt out of what they want to receive information on
5245513 they create activities to enjoy on campus and on the weekends
5245514 it is one of the most important times of someones life
5245515 it is a time of real growth when people challenge their own values as sensible and have opportunities to take on thoughts and different opinions that other people have
5245516 i would tell freshmen to be outgoing and talkative in class or in the dorm
5245517 if all you do is go to class and go home to do your homework it can get depressing
5245518 we are here to help students so they can focus on their education
5245519 we want students to come to us so we can help them face their legal issues alleviate some of their stress and get back to their studies
5245520 the 7 fee gives students access to legal advice and representation in court
5245521 court costs and possible fines are on the student but everything else is covered by the fee
5245522 any attorney here will help you as much as they can
5245523 we will represent you in court and even help with appeals
5245524 we deal in three main areas misdemeanor crimes landlord tenant cases and certain civil matters
5245525 while we cannot represent students in certain cases we can still give them advice and refer them to someone who can help
5245526 a lot of students do not really know all of the rights afforded to them as a tenant
5245527 if any student has a landlord issue it is important for that student to come and see us we can help
5245528 if we wouldnt use it we wouldnt want to sell it
5245529 we arent an off the shelf kind of costume place
5245530 we try to be a nice retro vintage option thats affordable
5245531 we were aware of the impact our purchasing was doing and after we found the right supplier we were able to go fair trade
5245532 its almost like a coffee shop you wouldnt find downtown
5245533 bring a scarf and definitely a good pair of boots
5245534 you need to make sure you bring your winter jacket up to kent in september
5245535 bring multiple pairs of gloves because people tend to lose them
5245536 its cold outside and hot in the classrooms in the winter and hot outside and cold in the classrooms in the summer
5245537 any area by the library will not allow you to make any forward progress
5245538 those funky bricks imbedded in the sidewalk are slippery when theyre wet
5245539 if you use an umbrella it has to be a good one
5245540 you want to fit in an extra five minutes in the wintertime to get to class
5245541 sign up for flashalerts because they send you text messages for snow days
5245542 all the neighboring townships have supported the project particularly franklin township which has put up matching money to put up parts of the trail
5245543 were calling this the h connector which would be the center part of that h connecting the ohio and erie canal corridor that runs from cleveland ultimately to cincinnati
5245544 it would then cut across the county to the east and link up with a north south trail called the lakes to rivers trail which goes from erie to the ohio river
5245545 the trail goes back through the woods and through our wetlands
5245546 there are sections of the trail that are actually boardwalk because the soil was too soft for paving
5245547 we think once the trail is complete that it will have tremendous economic benefits not only in bringing people to downtown kent to go shopping go out to eat enjoy riveredge park but i think well generate some businesses that will cater to these people interested in cycling so i would anticipate a bicycle shop
5245548 bike trails are a very popular thing certainly an amenity people are looking for when theyre looking to purchase a home
5245549 on the really organized rides we usually get 15 people
5245550 in the summer its not that organized we usually meet and ride until about 7 p m
5245551 we intend it for everyone but its usually only students who show up
5245552 volunteering is a great way to meet people like you
5245553 you are getting involved and making the world a better place
5245554 students will probably mostly be looking at their schedule and their e mail
5245555 try it get on the bus and just ride it
5245556 get on the campus loop just see where it goes
5245557 its one of the highest paid jobs on campus and we work around their schedule
5245558 its a very social activity but it also has the competitive aspect if you want it to be competitive
5245559 in college is where a lot of your lifelong friends are made you meet them through the activities you do through common interests
5245560 when you come to college you have a busy schedule and something gets left out and it could be physical activity
5245561 intramurals is different because it doesnt have the structure that a club program has with practice two to three times a week and travel
5245562 intramurals is getting your five best friends together and youre going to play
5245563 one of the biggest benefits to intramurals is that its a great way to get out and spend time with friends
5245564 intramurals is the perfect opportunity to try a new sport because its not as competitive theyre designed to be fun
5245565 as a senior i wish i would have started intramurals sooner
5245566 you meet a lot of people and it is a good time
5245567 intramurals keep you active and get you out of your dorm room
5245568 they are much like fraternities sororities or any other student organization
5245569 before college students were just a fish in the ocean
5245570 they have ramped up their technology and theyre not afraid to use it
5245571 they see that theres a need and thats why the issue is getting better
5245572 this allows me to know that they actually read and understand everything
5245573 the truth is today a president of a major research university is more like and im not sure if this is such a good thing a ceo of a large corporation
5245574 having to make executive decisions about a multi hundred million dollar budget
5245575 the provost is the chief academic officer of the university and oversees all the academic programs
5245576 while theyre students here both the quality of the education they get and any new programs that get initiated the provost would have a big role in those
5245577 im sort of the senior outreach officer for the university
5245578 that means that i interact with communities and with business and industry
5245579 not so much sitting in here but being out there
5245580 i work in one of those areas that students dont know a lot about
5245581 so by the time students get a sense of what were doing its really because of scholarships that have been donated faculty and professorships that have been established and newly renovated buildings
5245582 including admissions financial aid which is very popular with students and registration and on the student affairs side im responsible for many of the support services for students
5245583 i tend to interact a lot with folks who interact with students
5245584 students will interact first with us because they pay us
5245585 what they see in terms of the grounds and the condition of our buildings and the classrooms and dorms
5245586 were kind of responsible for all that maintenance and repair
5245587 we oversee the hiring and management of employment matters for the university
5245588 were providing a service to people who have a valid permit to that lot
5245589 on weekends the myth is that you can park anywhere you want thats not the case
5245590 people tell you that their grandmother died three or four times
5245591 i remember the first time i had to buy books
5245592 i paid almost 700 and five of the books i got were for just one class
5245593 the meat sauce and the marinara are eons better than they used to be
5245594 every time i come here i look around to see whats different
5245595 hopefully it will be hanging on a wall here someday
5245596 shes a good girl loves her mama loves jesus and america too
5245597 well youre going to be my host if i need one
5245598 hey candi chuck norris is the only person who can e mail a roundhouse kick
5245599 last sunday they wouldnt make me food until i told them a chuck norris fact
5245600 too many pitchers of dark and tans at mr bilbos in akron
5245601 i dedicate this one to michele because shes a sexy thing
5245602 if this was a white russian that would be fantastic
5245603 dont think that having a piece of paper at the end is enough to get you a job
5245604 its what you do to support that piece of paper internships organizations experiences that help you to get your job
5245605 they will appreciate you taking the time to introduce yourself
5245606 always leave yourself with enough time to get papers done
5245607 all nighters are not fun nor are they conducive to a productive learning environment
5245608 its nice because you get to choose when you work your best
5245609 if you go to class you might find yourself not having to study quite as hard when the test comes around
5245610 dont be afraid to do some things that youve never done before
5245611 if youre curious that opens up a whole new world for you
5245612 if you dont like a roommate or you arent happy dont wait until the end of the year to make a change
5245613 it will have a big effect on how much you enjoy school
5245614 the difference between high school and college is that nobody is looking over your shoulder in college
5245615 were more of a neighborhood store not a textbook store
5245616 we have stuff you would find in borders or barnes and nobles but much cheaper
5245617 i hope that every apocalyptic literature title is in those boxes
5245618 every shelf has quality books there isnt a lot of fluff
5245619 i highly suggest students budget appropriately to get the best value of their plan
5245620 it looks like a big lump sum but by the time you get down to the last weeks you realize you are running low
5245621 students are afraid to use their meal plan and dont know where the food places are
5245622 the biggest mistake students make is not coming to talk to us if you cant find something say so
5245623 i dont think that students realize how much authority that usg has
5245624 the best way for freshmen to get involved is to join any university committee and come to the meetings
5245625 another way to establish yourself would be to join an organization
5245626 usg teaches you how to deal with situations when your first idea doesnt work its about recovery and re planning
5245627 when we were healthy last year we were beating iowa state and we were beating ohio on the road which was a great win
5245628 so if we have a healthy quarterback were capable of making a run at this thing
5245629 this is my last year so i see us going out good this year and thats all that matters
5245630 im really planning on treating those guys a lot like i did our quarterbacks at east carolina giorgios going to get at least one series of each half to come in and play
5245631 we dont want to feel like we felt last year ever again
5245632 last year beating iowa state i think was a great learning curve for our players
5245633 they finally realized that they can go and win those games you dont just have to go play them and keep it close you can win that game i think we go into the boston college game and well go into iowa state fully expecting to win
5245634 you can come in and get a quality sandwich in a few minutes
5245635 were very busy here when school is in session as well as in the summer
5245636 im a big fan of racing and ive been coming here all of my life
5245637 i remember this place being built when i was about 3 or 4 years old
5245638 i like that you can see onto the street and that they have reading materials for customers
5245639 i want to serve the best product to people and give them more than they expect for their money
5245640 its close to campus so students can come here and use the wi fi to do their homework
5245641 its a young crowd and i have made a lot of friends working here
5245642 i have been drinking smoothies for a while and now i am addicted we have a lot of regular customers that come in four to five times a week
5245643 its a very good place to study and or hang out and just relax
5245644 sometimes all i want to get is a drink and thats perfectly ok at panera
5245645 you can sit there and talk for hours and no one will ever give it a second thought that youve been there for the entire afternoon
5245646 when i first started it it was exotic for kent
5245647 its mexican food with my unique twists you cant get what i make anywhere else
5245648 you can mix and match flavors like sweet potato and black bean everyone loves our burritos and once people try one they always come back
5245649 its just not like any corporate or even any other local place
5245650 the restaurant is personalized and very local its just relaxed and a fun environment
5245651 it is easy to go right past us and not stop
5245652 if you want to experience a part of kent definitely stop in and just try a burrito once you try one youll be back
5245653 when partying it is important to look out for your well being
5245654 we know that drinking happens at parties and the biggest concern for us is that people are being safe
5245655 if people choose to drink they need to be responsible
5245656 a plan should be devised and you should always stick together and watch each other carefully
5245657 a lot of students feel the need to drink to be part of the party but drinking too much is a real problem
5245658 it can lead to fights bad judgment blacking out and alcohol poisoning
5245659 a lot of time students may choose to engage in activities such as fighting or sex they otherwise would not
5245660 walking home especially after consuming alcohol can be extremely difficult
5245661 it is important to walk in areas where other people may be just in case you pass out or fall and hurt yourself
5245662 if you need directions help walking or getting home we are here
5245663 students should not be nervous to come to us it is better to get help and be safe
5245664 besides legal prosecution court costs fines and possible jail time students are subject to academic suspension and even expulsion
5245665 students may also miss classes miss assignments or miss work because of excessive drinking or partying
5245666 there are a lot of late night programs and activities for students to go to it is better to meet other people without alcohol because you can really get to know them and have fun
5245667 the loftable furniture can be manipulated in many different ways to make more space in the rooms
5245668 if students loft their beds over their desks it creates a private workspace in their room for them to do their homework
5245669 flat and wide containers are good for under the bed storage that can be used even when the beds are just on the ground
5245670 using extra hooks or hanging storage space helps to organize closets
5245671 the excitement is there just like buying a new home
5245672 it was actually a complete renovation where we emptied the entire building and did what we would call a gut rehabilitation of the place
5245673 it was one of the coldest buildings in the winter and the hottest room in the summer
5245674 whenever were doing renovation in an older building its always tricky and complicated because the building isnt necessarily built like the initial layouts we have
5245675 once you open the building and get started the building is not exactly what you expected
5245676 what happened is that they were remodeling all the buildings around that building and i kind of noticed it
5245677 so i went and looked at the history of the renovation plans and i saw every year it was just getting pushed back first 1997 then the next plan was in 2002 and then the next in 2008
5245678 we students marched out to the plaza and the same dude that said he didnt want to talk to us all of a sudden were sitting in a room with him
5245679 we had a plan and knew exactly what we wanted it was definitely a student movement supported by staff
5245680 this is a core element that constitutes the most important thing on this university campus diversity
5245681 i hope the curiously of students both black and white are going to get them here and i know once they are in there the climate will keep them there
5245682 i found myself carrying my office in the back seat of my car and having more office space as a professor is important ive always lived in a cubicle
5245683 this is one thing people need to understand whether theyre white black green yellow or polka dot oscar ritchie is a treasure to kent state
5245684 broomball is when you run around the ice with your gym shoes on with sticks that are the top part of a broom and you hit a ball around playing with the same rules as hockey
5245685 we have it set up so that it doesnt conflict with work or school
5245686 its really quiet during the day so if any students want to study they can bring their laptop here
5245687 whether its a horrible professor or not i probably still have to take it
5245688 id rather be reading about bella swan and edward cullen
5245689 certainly we were definitely disappointed in the way we performed last season
5245690 we had some success in the indoor and outdoor track seasons
5245691 hopefully we can carry the momentum we had in the outdoor season to the cross country season
5245692 we have a tradition of playing at the national level and playing for the national championship
5245693 we were very very close to winning it last season now were going to try to do it again
5245694 thats kind of a highlight of our fall and i think thatll test us and see where we are
5245695 you obviously have to be in the top 15 to get invited so we feel really good about that
5245696 my expectations are that if they continue to work hard theyre very coachable young men and we put them into elite competition theyre going to get better
5245697 we need to keep improving and with the right attitude i think thatll happen
5245698 all types of people students and other people from the area
5245699 i think anything starbucks can make we can make better
5245700 i was looking for an atmosphere that starbucks couldnt offer
5245701 susans has an independent vibe not a pre scripted generic atmosphere thats at every other commercial coffee shop
5245702 it has a gorgeous view and the building is just beautiful
5245703 its pretty spacious so you have the choice of an isolated coffee experience or if you wanted to be with a large group of people you could
5245704 i think that we have food and thats a big difference
5245705 and you get a little bit more personal service it feels like home
5245706 and our bakery is a lot better than the competitors our treats are baked fresh every day
5245707 we paint it to celebrate occasions show off milestones during pledging or just for the heck of it
5245708 the first time out it gets done wrong every time
5245709 what is important for freshmen to know is the notion of inquire learn and reflect and the whole idea expressed in those three words
5245710 find out what happened learn about it and reflect on it and what it means to you all these years later
5245711 it was an opportunity to bring in a scholar to work with the students
5245712 we had a young team last year in that i had to have a lot of freshmen step up
5245713 i think its just huge that we have a lot of experienced seasoned veterans coming back for this year
5245714 i think we know we can do it we always play hard were always competitive we know in our heads that we can do it and i think that this year could be a good year
5245715 the past two recruiting classes weve been really pleased with
5245716 this one we feel the same with were going to have to wait and see how the team forms up i have seven juniors and seniors together and then 15 sophomores and freshmen so were sort of looking to all of them to come in and play a role
5245717 its really key to have plenty of nationally ranked opponents to help us with our national ranking
5245718 if we can knock off a few of those teams it really helps us with our ratings percentage index
5245719 in the mac we kind of beat each other up
5245720 its very competitive you cant take anything lightly were a process oriented team and we try to take things one game at a time
5245721 at the end of the day you could have exercised for two hours but if youve taken in 500 extra calories it doesnt matter how much you exercised
5245722 youre on your own and it is a whole other lifestyle because its a lot of grab and go youre on the run youre studying and youre trying to balance everything
5245723 nutrition is something new and if you dont have any direction it can get lost in the shuffle
5245724 its not like freshman 15 happens all of a sudden it could be 50 calories a day that youre over
5245725 its not going to show the first month or two but six months down the road you get on the scale and weigh five more pounds and wonder how it happened
5245726 youre going to meet friends and you usually end up eating what they eat
5245727 keep that in mind and be an individual think about what youre putting into your body
5245728 some people want to gain muscle mass and some people want to lose weight and some people are training for a triathlon or other event
5245729 the fitness assessment is a comprehensive printout of where you are at physically
5245730 we do cardiovascular endurance muscular strength flexibility and body composition
5245731 i see a wide range of people some are really fit and some are very out of shape
5245732 its better to learn the right form with someone watching than to come here alone and be doing the wrong things
5245733 the majority of the time people do training because they want to be accountable
5245734 you have somebody that youre accountable to you have appointments and the accountability factor is huge
5245735 dont let it get so bad that you just let yourself go
5245736 if you can find one class you really like and make it a weekly event
5245737 get into a routine right off the bat and make it a priority to come to the rec center
5245738 its helping to take our program to the next level
5245739 the video boards will really enhance the opportunity for students to participate like they hadnt before in terms of promoting student events and activities
5245740 we will have the ability to host major concerts there and were really looking forward to having more kent state students involved on football weekends
5245741 we run game day shuttles to and from the game
5245742 well have pregame tailgating in place and itll be a great party environment at kent state football games
5245743 the one thing were really working on this year is to make sure that we become a unified team
5245744 we cant look for just one player to carry the majority of the weight
5245745 everybody has got to carry their own weight and make sure that its a smooth running team
5245746 we got a fantastic group of seniors that will help us lead
5245747 the rest of the players that have their maturity understand that being a team sport you need to be as unified as possible
5245748 we always strive for excellence and were not going to be satisfied unless were at the top of the conference
5245749 thats what we build for every day and thats what we work for
5245750 we keep trying to reload and bring in very talented players who have a lot of room for improvement and hopefully their games grow as theyre here and they become very accomplished players
5245751 they have some big shoes to fill but i think hopefully theyll be able to step up to the challenge
5245752 i think they can so i think we should be pretty good
5245753 their experience should hopefully propel their game to the next level
5245754 were going to count on those three very heavily to keep this team improving
5245755 i think we can kind of go into the season with the mindset to continue the momentum that we had from last season
5245756 we can win the first tournament and that would be great we have the talent to do that
5245757 choose a job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life
5245758 pick a major you love and you will never have to work a day in college
5245759 its definitely a family atmosphere during the day but it does a complete 180 at night
5245760 a lot of kids come down for the first time to see if what they heard about the burgers and beers is true
5245761 after they realize they can have fun meet other people their age and spend 10 on a whole evening out theyre hooked
5245762 its a more mature bar but not necessarily by age
5245763 its obvious that we dont have a bouncer for a reason theres no need
5245764 from sinatra to every tool album stuff where youre gonna hear something good every time
5245765 you can actually sit on a toilet in this place without contracting 20 diseases
5245766 i opened the space up for whatever someone would like to do
5245767 this is really a place for people whove always bitched about other places in kent and wanted to create their own bar
5245768 youll definitely have a palate for good beer after drinking here
5245769 im just throwing a bunch of irons in the fire
5245770 ill throw something else at them if people arent interested
5245771 if youve never drank wine in your life you can find something you like
5245772 if youve been drinking wine for 20 years you can find something you like weve really got a little bit for everyone

5245788 i realized during the final stages of floetry that i hadnt developed a voice to air my own fears simply because i have never believed in fear articulation as i am not afraid so i had to find a new language to be able to articulate the experiences that i was having a language that recognizes the reality of change without seeking an avenue of victimization and i used that new language to create this album

5245818 se n o foram chances claras estivemos muito pr ximos do gol para caprichar um pouco mais no cruzamento e no pen ltimo passe fica o sentimento de tristeza por mais uma derrota mas ao mesmo tempo fica a certeza que evolu mos temos um time mais firme que fica mais com a bola e deu poucas chances ao advers rio

5245830 our previous studies showed that soft landing can be used to prepare ultrapure peptide layers on substrates the question we faced was in addition to controlling purity can we also control the structure of the molecules we showed we could
5245831 because we were starting from something that wasnt helical in solution we were a little pessimistic whether it would work at all
5245832 we found an interesting pathway to conduct different types of chemical reactions between complex molecules and substrates that will potentially enable us to prepare materials that cannot be made by standard methods
5245833 we hope to conduct lots of chemistry on the thin films

5245841 theyre renting to anybody and its really not good for the owners were suffering
5245842 unfortunately many of our high crime areas are also by coincidence our highest rental property areas and i think a lot of that has to do with the landlords not maintaining their properties or doing proper background checks and taking a good look at the people who move in
5245843 its amazing the divide between the residents and the landlords
5245844 until the residents of the community and the landlords together try to remedy those remote problem areas itll never be peace and harmony together

5245857 most of the people who are attacked in town dont want the bear killed they recognize she is a mom defending her cubs
5245858 we just cant let her live there because she will attack again
5245859 we need to kill some of these bears and we need to kill some of these moose

5245870 some may view recent news about britney spears and her sister jamie lynn as cautionary tales for young people and parenthood
5245871 however new jersey adults worry that media coverage of celebrity pregnancy may be having the opposite effect on the average teenager
5245872 the poll revealed some surprising differences in opinion among parents of teenage daughters
5245873 they appear to be less worried than other parents about teenage pregnancy and slightly less supportive of sex education
5245874 people are opportunistic a holes in general and what happens in a casino is there are an awful lot of opportunities for these kinds of sleazy behavior

5245881 potentially every movement at least on the gambling floor is being monitored
5245882 its not like i gamble today lose 50 and go out and commit a crime
5245883 weve had these thefts based on alleged gambling addictions long before harrahs ever opened
5245884 it seems like whether or not the casino is 10 miles away or 50 miles away theyre going to find a way to gamble
5245885 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes

5245961 and personally i feel she probably hasnt done herself any favours with the article as it seems to concentrate on the more bizarre aspects of her subsequent alien visitation s and is even titled
5245962 it was like a big headlamp but not as big as a football and hovering above the rooftops i wasnt scared the ufo was there for about 10 minutes i was fascinated i always sort of believed in them and knew something was out there when i saw one it confirmed it
5245963 we used to speak in telepathy and they would immobilise me
5245964 we would get psychic messages from extra terrestrials and they would channel themselves through someones body
5245965 id had a bad relationship and thought why not ask them for help and love i was sitting on the sofa and i heard a voice say are you feeling ok i didnt know what to do it was a lovely softly spoken voice it was a nice english accent the voice asked me do you want us to play you some music i said yes i started hearing 1940s music it made me laugh i thought it was so funny either theyve got a sense of humour or they dont know what music i like
5245966 we got engaged but the aliens came between me and my fianc first of all he didnt believe in it because i was saying all these things i was lodging with him when i heard a loud bang the aliens had bumped themselves down and fallen on top of each other they were laughing and giggling about it it was so strange to see aliens on the floor thinking it was funny
5245967 he said he heard the bang and i think i believe you he called them the three amigos
5245968 an alien pulled up in a silver car it was quite early in the morning i seemed to see in my mind this alien pulling up in an expensive honda car i could see it in my mind parked up outside the house i thought i better compose myself i am going to be frightened i tried to trace them in my mind coming in the door and coming up the stairs but in a matter of two seconds it came to the bottom of my bed they looked like doctors one had a clipboard i had been suffering from cystitis at the time but i know they gave me an operation on my forehead they cut through a piece i was aware of it and sort of conscious it seemed to hurt but as soon as they had gone it went i dont know whether they were trying to make me more psychic if you have an operation on your third eye you become more psychic sometimes they put implants in people and put them up their noses to track people not for any bad reasons just to know what people are doing i think they were investigating me anyway i think they are investigating a lot of humans on the planet to see how their minds work and to change the way the world works
5245969 i was laid on the settee and fell asleep then i heard a sound at the door it just sounded like when you stand on a cats tail it was quite a scary experience i felt either a rope or a fishing line come around me it didnt hurt it was like a lasso it was wet and it touched me on the face as if id been hit with a wet fish i was going up towards the light i didnt want to go any further and gently came back down they have visited me about 30 times its fairly regular at one point it seemed to be happening all the time each experience is totally different they used to put a ray over my body to immobilise me i think it was to try to calm you down they didnt do anything sinister to me i dont tell people they are quite frightened of it i dont need to tell people i dont think they believe me thats why im telling my story to the mail to give credibility i want to get it into concrete evidence if you dont come out and say people think maybe people may say im barmy but at the moment weve got a hole in the ozone layer we are living in times that are delicately balanced i dont know what we are going to do

5245980 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of rusian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5245981 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5245982 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5245983 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century

5245991 it is time to move heparin off the farm and into the factory where it will be safer to make and more regulated
5245992 the crisis was motivation to pull this kind of technical gee whiz process we used in our laboratories and think about how to scale it up to producing heparin by the metric ton
5245993 we use approximately three trillion units of heparin a year in the u s

5246205 but it is not uncommon in this sport to compete with three members weve lost a strong one but one of our closest opponents are in the same position
5246206 you folks are so worried and you really dont have all that much to lose
5246207 it may not seem like much to you but it is all we got to us
5246208 they are running away from that hurricane they dont know yet but they may have lost all they got

5246215 we must act quickly if we are to stop the werewolf

5246222 how the vacuum is handled by the civilian government how much control they can exercise on the radical elements remains to be seen
5246223 after four good years in which india had high hopes for the peace process in the last four months the opposite has happened
5246224 musharraf was seen by india as decisive and ready to engage compared with the chaos and division of the last few months
5246225 the isi enjoyed greater autonomy since musharrafs wings were clipped
5246226 once he is removed from the scene isi may have even greater autonomy
5246227 whether he is impeached or not is not important from the indian point of view
5246228 but it leaves a big vacuum and we are deeply concerned about this vacuum because it leaves the radical extremist outfits with freedom to do what they like not merely on pak istan afghan border but clearly our side of the border too
5246229 i could probably help you more than you can help me
5246230 de kans is groot dat er door deze gesprekken een einde komt aan aan een jarenlang conflict
5246231 i look at a lot of joe and jane consumers on main street anywhere and a lot of them are pretty content with just a regular cellphone
5246232 it does what they need it to do and basically that is just to make a phone call
5246233 theyre still going to remain in the minority mainly because these devices basically just arent for everyone
5246234 i think some companies will say blasphemy to this but not everyone is going to need a blackberry not everyone is going to need an iphone not everyone is going to need a palm treo
5246235 if a smart phone or a regular cellphone didnt make phone calls or didnt make phone calls well people would just switch their phones and say i am getting something else mainly because thats the intended purpose
5246236 obviously because canadians are such high users of voice its a pretty good indicator that we do like to talk

5246238 we are in court again next week on other matters and my hope is we can get the warrant resolved by then and get back on track
5246239 we have some things in the works to get the warrant taken care of my hope is that we can resolve it without an arrest but hes been arrested at the airport before so they obviously have an eye out for him so im not sure

5246241 i didn t think i d be here this long when i first came here but as i ve often said there are no push factors if you re coaching at the university of florida there are no push factors to make you want to leave outside schools might show an interest and create some pull factors but there are not enough push factors to ever leave here

5246245 i think i need to take a page out of urban myer s playbook kelly brings some of that similar skill set as in that she s they are so unique to the position she could set for us she could hit for us can we combine both can she score points for us serving blocking and attacking and still play the role of the setter in distributing how can we change an offense that can maximize her talents that s our challenge
5246246 i have sent my resignation to the presidents secretariat and told them i cant continue performing my duties after the president resigned i didnt think it would be ethically right to continue
5246247 there will be a more balanced view of him in the future than there is now
5246248 a lot of things happened in pakistan for the good under his watch and i think that is something the history books will recall after some time
5246249 he manipulated elections he hounded his opponents and he became a dictator its not much of a legacy
5246250 he never tried to create an impression in pakistan that we were fighting for our own country and our own good
5246251 and because of that the pakistan army became a client army and pakistan became a client state in the eyes of the people it was a major failing on his part
5246252 and he didnt understand that a country of 160 million people couldnt be ruled by just one man
5246253 if i was doing this just for myself i might have chosen a different course but i put pakistan first as always
5246254 even if i beat this impeachment relations between the presidency and the government can never be fixed pillars of the state parliament and the judiciary would be harmed and god forbid the army might have been dragged in
5246255 no charge sheet can stand against me because i never did anything for myself whatever i did i put pakistan first
5246256 when i took over nine years ago this country was on the verge of being declared a terrorist state on the verge of becoming a failed state
5246257 the challenges of the last nine years have been greater than any in pakistans history yet have i met those challenges
5246258 this is the first time in pakistans political history where you have the people winning against establishment institutions
5246259 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5246260 i feel pain not because of his exit but because of his quitting ways
5246261 i think he should have at least waved goodbye to the 90 000 person audience in the stadium if it was me i would prefer to walk the 110 meters until the end
5246262 i think liu xiang isnt confident he thought he wouldnt win the race he was afraid then used the excuse of a foot injury to withdraw from the competition it is really a disappointing thing he has disappointed all the chinese
5246263 although liu doesnt go out often whenever he does he sees his own picture in the streets and then whenever he surfs the internet he sees all kinds of information about him
5246264 liu xiang is a great athlete he withstands the kind of pressure that no other athlete could withstand
5246265 liu xiang is obviously very sad and i can understand his pain
5246266 it is painful for him but the pain is not in his leg where is the pain
5246267 there is a subplot in which emanuelle mistakes her father for her former husband with predictably cringe inducing results but the main pleasure of the film is watching the incredibly sexy lesley find every feasible excuse in the book to get naked

5246275 i love the blogs name its also an appropriate moniker for middle age cyclists who i suspect use that third chainring occasionally
5246276 i really like your blog going to have to add it to my daily websites
5246277 it covers a wide spectrum of cycling issues european and domestic racing as well as some of the history and tradition of the sport very well written and presented
5246278 lately ive been enjoying the collaborative cycling blog run in part by former chicagoan leonard basobas as someone who admittedly doesnt follow the nrc much except for when its racing nearby this fans point of view is useful for staying abreast of the various personalities and storylines
5246279 the time is coming we will have to pay the piper at some point
5246280 guys like matt wilson and ian macgregor really stepped up today because they want to be part of the team effort
5246281 it kind of shows the depth of this team we dont have the big superstar rider we just have a lot of guys that cling to one another
5246282 i sort of waited until the other guys started to pop
5246283 when i saw tom danielson was on the front and slowing down i thought what the heck and gave it a go

5246297 we were looking for a fast and reliable solution for assessing and measuring the risks of hard to value otc products that we negotiate within the framework of our activity on structured funds we found out in price it a product that offers similarly market models to those developed by our research teams and which in addition perfectly met our specific needs in terms of flexibility for setting up products and for the validation of our prices
5246298 with the identical recovery capabilities to those of large investment banks and particularly due to the possibility of setting up the most complicated payoffs with a specific language price it has proved to be the most suited solution to go with the pricing and sensibilities controls on our otc products
5246299 we have combined oilseed rape at moisture contents we would never previously have entertained

5246314 all levels of government need to work together to provide various supports for hard hit communities including extending ei benefits for laid off forestry workers in the region providing benefits for other non forestry workers contractors and self employed individuals instituting the northern living allowance and giving relief from any carbon taxes that are enacted either provincially or federally
5246315 an injury to one community is an injury to all with all the chaos in the forest industry it is important that communities stick together and support each other

5246319 its a shield the city just wants to gentrify the neighborhood so they can make some good money and theyre using public funds to buy all the real estate

5246321 people in amsterdam and the rest of the country are starting to discern real tolerance from bogus tolerance
5246322 when rudy giuliani started to clean up times square in the mid 90s some people were warning that no one would ever again want to come to new york city but as far as i know it has had record tourist numbers each year since
5246323 we have taken the position that it is business as usual in mackenzie and we will be going ahead with all the usual programs
5246324 recently the northern trust provided funding for a mobile poultry processing facility and a loan guarantee for a co op abattoir so i would imagine those kinds of applications could be the kind of projects that would be supported through this new fund
5246325 for example i could see the funds being used to develop some sort of processing facility that will help export globally the agricultural products from the peace or the northwest

5246336 further by december 2009 an external team will have reviewed how the electronic prescription service has been deployed

5246349 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5246350 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5246351 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5246352 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5246353 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5246354 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks

5246415 nu nog stappen klanten bij de reseller binnen voor advies om vervolgens het product online te kopen
5246416 we moeten duidelijker maken dat de aanschafprijs niet het belangrijkste is maar de totale kosten plus de services die wij erbij kunnen verlenen

5246427 on another occasion cruden had apparently gone to break up a brawl but ended up spending the best part of an hour admonishing disorderly soldiers not to swear while periodically whacking them on the head with a shovel he also would propose to women with whom he had established no romantic bond one such intended he had not even met being unable to take no for an answer he would then turn himself into a persistent nuisance if not a stalker
5246428 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
5246429 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver the pregnancy
5246430 its one thing to take our money and do what they did to harm us
5246431 its another to dismiss our grieving that is the ultimate slap
5246432 the apa should advocate a closer examination of the grief and warn women of the well documented dangers of abortion
5246433 instead the apa continues to censor information de legitimize research prohibit opposing points of view obstruct discussions avoid scholarly debates and promote intolerance of those who are negatively impacted by abortion
5246434 abortion violates the civil rights and human rights of the baby in the womb and then it hurts the mother
5246435 the apa wants to say we are the exception to the rule but for every one woman they can find that says they werent harmed by abortion they could find 10 women who were

5246440 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5246441 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5246442 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5246443 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5246444 your point seems to be that they are basically the same car and then you try to explain it away by saying that you meant that they were both f body cars

5246450 we continue to make strides towards achieving our goal of becoming cash flow breakeven in the next few quarters although our loss decreased significantly in the second quarter from a year ago our cash loss for the period was substantially less than the net loss for the period we are completing our consolidation of the deltron acquisition into the power electronics division while simultaneously strengthening our product offerings and engineering depth identifying new market opportunities for our products and technologies and expanding our horizons in the renewable energy and alternative power market segments we have a number of exciting opportunities before us related to our current growth strategies and we are confident the benefits will produce substantial benefits to our stockholders i remain confident that revenue levels will continue to equal or exceed those of previous quarters we look forward to meeting our goals and objectives for 2008 and beyond

5246462 over the last 22 months we have worked diligently to eliminate the legacy issues that have hampered our efforts this contingent settlement agreement is another step in that direction the camofi note and litigation have effectively precluded our ability to raise equity and debt financing without significant equity dilution upon obtaining the financing to remove the contingency we will again be able to incorporate portfolio acquisitions as a part of our strategy to drive growth in top line revenue and build shareholder value i am confident the shareholders will agree that this is a positive move for the company
5246463 the resolution of the camofi litigation will remove a significant legal overhang on the company both potential lenders and investors had difficulty assessing its potential impact on the company and putting it behind us lifts that uncertainty we have generally worked to avoid one time charges against our earnings but we believe it is in the best interests of our shareholders to incur this one time charge to prevent potentially significant future equity dilution
5246464 we remain focused on delivering positive financial results for our shareholders and other stakeholders getting this behind us along with the ongoing positive results of our turnaround strategy and the strength of our core business will continue to add momentum toward our profitability and growth

5246479 eugenics is the study of the agencies under social control that may improve or impair the racial qualities of future generations either physically or mentally
5246480 there is no denying the natural world would be a better place without people all people not a selective bunch get it straight
5246481 we can set no limit to human potentialities all that is best in man can be bettered the ordinary social reformer sets out with a belief that no environment can be too good for humanity it is without contradicting this that the eugenist may add that man can never be too good for his environment
5246482 the mystery of birth and of the transmission of characteristics from parent to offspring has always intrigued the human mind it would be tempting now to ask geneticists to evolve better human beings but who will decide what is better
5246483 the most merciful thing that a family does to one of its infant members is to kill it
5246484 the first century or two of the new millennium will almost certainly be a golden age for eugenics through application of new genetic knowledge and reproductive technologies the major change will be to mankind itself t echniques such as genetic manipulations are not yet efficient enough to be unquestionably suitable in therapeutic and eugenic application for humans but with the pace of research it is surely only a matter of time and a short time at that
5246485 the third group of society are those irresponsible and reckless ones having little regard for the consequences of their acts or whose religious scruples prevent their exercising control over their numbers many of this group are diseased feeble minded and are of the pauper element dependent upon the normal and fit members of society for their support there is no doubt in the minds of all thinking people that the procreation of this group should be stopped
5246486 eugenics is the most adequate and thorough avenue to the solution of racial political and social problems
5246487 when one considers how much the world owes to single individuals of the order of capability of an einstein pasteur descartes leonardo or lincoln it becomes evident how vastly society would be enriched if they were to be manifolded later generations will look with amazement at the pitifully small amount of research now being carried on to open up such possibilities even though for years specialists have realized that they lie just around the corner it is quite evident that we could benefit indefinitely by a continued increase in our mental powers to enable us to analyze more profoundly to recognize more readily common features when they lie deeply buried to grasp more and more elements of a situation at once and co ordinately to see more steps ahead to think more multi dimensionally and to imagine more creatively if we hold fast to our ideal then evolution will become for the first time a conscious process that will be the highest form of freedom that man or life can have
5246488 cases will continue to not be detected or to be withdrawn in large numbers before and after reaching courts if policies and resource allocation is not radically changed to a singleminded focus on creating the necessary capacity to detect criminals and gather credible evidence to ensure convictions in courts

5246490 the people who were shot were from the anc rally and at this juncture we believe the shooters werent from a soccer match or anything but were from the strong base of the ifp in unit 17 of umlazi
5246491 we condemn the shooting in the strongest possible terms especially because the general elections are approaching but it was irresponsible for him cele to say the bullet comes from the ifp
5246492 we agreed on the idea in principle if they want me to do this job i dont see a problem coming to help

5246529 the delay in the itc investment tax credit renewal has meant that large commercial jobs are being postponed
5246530 because they dont want to give the democratic congress any credit
5246531 many of these commercial projects are in important planning stages right now and the overall industry is at the tipping point that will lead to widespread adoption
5246532 the absence of the itc will kill most if not all of this growing momentum we need only look to the interruption of tax credits for the wind industry for an example of something that we do not want to repeat this would be a real shame
5246533 over the longer term however the united states commercial market is far too important to be ignored
5246534 a consistent itc policy extending over several years that allows industry to grow and flourish is critical to the industry
5246535 the itc has become a very politicized issue however and its possible that approval could extend into 2009

5246541 75 to 95 of viread sales resulted from off label marketing efforts
5246542 took three forms 1 marketing to hiv patients co infected with hepatitis b 2 marketing viread as a first line or initial therapy for hiv infection and 3 marketing against vireads safety profile
5246543 75 to 95 of viread sales resulted from off label marketing efforts
5246544 connect the following chain of events 1 that the alleged failure to disclose the off label marketing scheme caused a material increase in sales 2 that practitioners materially decreased their demand for viread due to the publication of the fda warning letter and most importantly 3 that the alleged decrease in sales due to the fda letter proximately caused gileads stock to decrease three months later
5246545 t he market was not told that off label marketing was the cornerstone of demand this mistaken impression of demand led to among other things wholesaler overstocking in reaction to an anticipated price increase when the truth about off label marketing was disclosed however they could no longer maintain the sales growth levels that investors had come to expect and gileads stock price dropped accordingly

5246675 the kamakhya temple has the most ancient place where the goddess kamakhya is offered this nitya bhog goddess kamakhya is offered with the sacrifice of animals and pigeons where the devotees dance in two variations of dance form one the semi classical and the other in trance form which is mostly in aerobatic form
5246676 day by day kamakhya is regaining its glory with its customs and after the great ambubasi mela the deodhani nritya dance festival is the most liked festival where thousands of the devotees and tourist sit on the pavilion to view the trance form of offering the goddess that is the most unique in hindus this time we are pleased to capture a record gathering of nearly 23 thousand viewers for the festival and it is increasing everyday as the fest will be observed for three days
5246677 its so crowded this time that we needed to take our seats one hour before the festival the dance begins at the evening and rolls to the dawn where they perform the typical deodhani dance which is a unique way to express the sacrifice of their lives for the holy goddess
5246678 last year it was nearly 14 and 12 thousand in year before that but this time its the highest that is 22 654 we have tried to arrange the allocation and food supply to the devotees with the help of few ngos and government departments but it still needs a better government approach as the rhythm festival is getting higher popularity across the globe fast
5246679 its indeed a pleasure to host such big crowd in the most historical and devotional place of the country kamakhya and the board has been sincerely doing it for long the government is also extending its hand for the success of the festivals and surely we will do the best in near future to maintain the temple glory to the highest and prestigious status
5246680 we are scanning the devotees and given no priority to trespass any suspicious people but the huge public response of the fest this time has created a hectic job for us the temple is one of the most whole places of hindu gathering and we are trying to give it the maximum security
5246681 we will hold important talks with iran within one month we hope that the work which we launched before will produce a result during this period

5246731 stevenson the vice chair of the joint committee on administrative rules jcar said his motion in no way reflects his opinion of the legislation
5246732 our committee has a very narrow focus and that is to ensure rules and regulations fit within our guidelines there were 120 pages of regulations a few went beyond statutory limits allowed stevenson said they didnt fit in the framework of the statute
5246733 but this is not a policy debate if a representative or senator wants to introduce legislation to allow these changes that is a different story

5246801 both harsha and i are overwhelmed with the response that we have received from our listeners and celebrities who came over to personally support and encourage us they have given us the much needed boost to complete our target of 92 7 hours on the morning of 15

5246806 one thing he does know is usb everyone knows usb
5246807 he is definitely choosing for the hardline and he has always done that and i think it is particularly unlikely for him to concede powers over the security establishment
5246808 i think the question to ask from where im sitting is whether it is mugabes decision
5246809 it would be very difficult for the joc for instance to give up ministerial posts if this includes giving up the security portfolios
5246810 its better not to have a deal than to have a bad deal
5246811 there will be an immense pressure on both parties to reach a deal

5246813 robert mugabe might be willing to give some power to morgan tsvangirai but that power will only translate to 25 percent of real power and that would not include him giving morgan control of the army police and the intelligence
5246814 zanu pf seems to have a problem in giving real power to the mdc but eventually they will have to
5246815 for me it confirms to all these doubters that i am fit enough to do this

5246819 its phenomenal yesterday i was pretty down after the first couple of rounds i was mainly disappointed because i didnt want to let these guys down i was on the back foot a bit because it was a tough day the day before
5246820 but these guys sacrificed a lot its just fantastic to be part of this team weve come a long way in four years and to put a time like that on the board is phenomenal really
5246821 i set out to do that i believed i could do it but to put it into practice is another thing its such a relief when you do it and cross the line
5246822 we were just rattling round it was so smooth it felt easy to be honest as we got closer and knew wed won morale went up and we were just chasing them
5246823 we knew it was fast but 53 3 i cant believe it its great

5246829 through the carnival we seek to transfer the skills that are important to the creative industries such as costume making music dance and song
5246830 secondly we want to build social cohesion by creating activities that give young people an opportunity to understand and express their heritage and cultures
5246831 the large costumes that he assisted in designing and building will be featured in this years carnival
5246832 the first thing i had to do was try and stay calm and not yell what are you thinking
5246833 this wasnt about the girl developing hair early it was the mothers obsession with wanting her daughter to be a supermodel

5246853 if the storm proves not to be so serious to the oil industry then its quite likely well see the market continue to retreat
5246854 it is a quiet start to the week for the markets in terms of economic data and indeed for the week as a whole things could be relatively patchy which should mean little prospect of a re think in terms of the interest rate outlook in developed markets
5246855 currency players are still factoring in how bad the european economy will be
5246856 jmm is holding a crucial meeting of all party mlas and mps to chalk out the next plan of action we are making exercises to form the next government the situation would be clear in a day or two

5246863 he was instantly impressed by the image of the communist icon that left a revolutionary mark in him
5246864 if i want to be a minister of the country i can easily achieve that
5246865 we were basically stuck up the canyon without our rafts
5246866 we had no supplies no food and very little water we lost everything

5246868 we do not want a deterioration of international relations we want to be respected we want our people our values to be respected
5246869 we have always been a peace loving state practically there is not a single occasion in the history of the russian or soviet state when we first started military actions

5246917 i would not be surprised if it is windy enough to cause some disruption with trees in full leaf and heavy rain weakening soil it does not take much to bring branches down
5246918 the good news is the weather should calm down later in the week
5246919 the bank holiday weekend looks quite promising especially for southern and eastern areas of the uk which might get some nice warm weather
5246920 the jet stream is close to or south of the uk which means more wet and windy weather streaming through with intervals of sunshine however the different forecasting models are disagreeing with each other on where and when the rain will drop which shows that the outlook is very uncertain and theres very little confidence in the medium range forecasts at the moment

5246934 telephone numbers from identified blocks shall be allocated to isps unified access service providers basic service providers and cellular mobile service providers for internet telephony

5246954 i think you would have to stick with a short list of about five extremely liquid stocks hdfc bank icici bank state bank of india sbi axis bank and maybe kotak mahindra bank in terms of chart one is probably likely to get the most violent moves on axis bank and hdfc bank has probably got the most underlying strength in a sense that it is likely to lose the least in a downturn
5246955 sbi and the bank nifty will probably move just about as much as each other kotak mahindra bank is a bit of an enigma to me as i was never been able to comfortably chart that one but it does generate a lot of volume i guess in terms of underlying strength i would go with hdfc bank if i was playing both sides of the market it would be axis bank

5246980 fertilizer sector as a whole holds some promise we are in a crisis situation as far as the industry is concerned and the government whenever it is in crisis will act and it does act so we have seen a new fertilizer policy and more than ever before we feel that there is a scope for implementing it in true earnest and in spirit as well the fertilizer policy the way it is in the medium term it will be extremely positive for fertilizer companies which are able to expand their capacities quickly and these are the fertilizers do have debottle necking plans in place which they could immediately implement as soon as they are more convinced on subsidy aspect because the situation is such that although they are eligible for subsidy they are actually not getting the subsidy from the government and instead the government is offering them bonds which in turn results in further losses for them
5246981 the way to play fertilizer from our view is that at these slightly lower levels one could gradually start buying into fertilizer companies i think go with the larger ones that they are the safest ones to play with the likes of may be tata chemical chambal zuari coromandel and stick to the larger ones which have demonstrated good scalable capacities and ability to write through all the kind of ups and downs the industry has seen to sum up i think its a sector which we are positive on and may be as soon as there is some political stability may be after the elections that is one sector which we should see further reforms and implementation of new policy in true earnest

5246991 we aim to empower women promote child education with an emphasis on girls and stop corruption and domestic violence first we go to the politce and request that they do something but since the administration is against the poor people of our country we often end up taking matters into our own hands we first speak to the husband who is beating his wife if he doesnt understand then we ask his wife to join us while we beat him with lathis our missions have a 100 percent success rate
5246992 i have no money and i rely on my son to bring home something every evening so we can cook our daily meal i joined the gang six months ago and since then i feel self confident and much stronger when i joined the gang sampat devi gave us an introduction to what the motives of the gang were and we were trained in lathi combat the basic concept of the fight is more to defend than to attack we are not a violent lot but if you challenge us we are vicious we use peaceful means first but if things dont work we resort to a lathi fight being in the gang has changed my life i plan to stay here till i die
5246993 we have no hierarchy in our gang we are all treated as equals and we work toward a common goal of removing corruption from the roots of society and bringing justice to women my husband abandoned me for a better life with another woman but i dont care i have my own life and i am happy with it people have to understand that a gang doesnt have to be made up of the antisocial elements that accompany many other so called gangs ours is a team a team of women in pink

5247002 and thats how we get competitive in the indianas and virginias
5247003 thats why i pay more attention to the registration figures than to the polls this time of year
5247004 the polls will change but we know we need 200 000 new voters to be competitive in georgia
5247005 the big difference this year is not the technology its the coordination

5247039 i am 20 years old i am self revealing neat unpredictable silly charming aggressive assertive organized and far from ordinary i happen to be a social chameleon
5247040 ive fallen in love with you and ill never let you go i love you more than anything i just had to let you know and if you ever wonder why i dont know what ill say but ill never stop loving you each and everyday
5247041 i think we can do a much better job and not increase taxes
5247042 several years ago the economy was strong we gave that break to people who made over half a million dollars
5247043 now the economy is weak we need to this group of californians to contribute to the economy so those people who make 60 000 40 000 30 000 a year can afford to send their children to school
5247044 we spend every penny the state receives and we spend them on new programs and bigger government
5247045 if we dont pass a budget soon we are going to have to engage in a different type of borrowing borrowing just to pay the day to day services that the state provides
5247046 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5247047 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5247048 we dont want to do it unilaterally i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5247049 the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses than just a week and a half or two weeks ago so there are already consequences
5247050 i think they may not appreciate the magnitude of those consequences yet the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be
5247051 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5247052 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5247053 if i would ask you how fast the american forces can leave iraq the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5247054 the same answer would be toward this situation as soon as we are assured that georgians will not continue to use military force against south ossetians and against abkhazians
5247055 seiu members are in difficult negotiations with the county and having supervisors that understand working peoples issues is vital for this county
5247056 we have gone from a collaborative deal making mentality in the context of reasonable economic times in 2002 to a mind set of confrontation combat and political activism today
5247057 it is an attempt to buy through independent campaign expenditure committees the other side of the bargaining table at the expense of taxpayers
5247058 last time there was a cooperative spirit and there was no winning or losing on issues as we went along
5247059 this time they dont seem to intend to negotiate anything with anybody and they are not coming up with anything that doesnt screw people
5247060 its like getting your visa bill and you start digging yourself deeper and deeper into debt if you keep making minimum payments
5247061 sooner or later the actual costs are going to be so huge that the supervisors are going to have to eliminate programs and employees it will be unacceptable to decimate county services so we are trying to avoid a financial meltdown that will get passed on to the next board of supervisors
5247062 it plays out in their showing up at board meetings handing fliers out at the fair and activism in the electoral process
5247063 it plays out in making them resistent to concluding a contract because they need the energy to influence the elections
5247064 i love mendocino everyones friendly its a very relaxed atmosphere
5247065 you see more older men with gray ponytails and theyre not riding motorcycles
5247066 its one of a few places where people dont want things to change
5247067 the whole world changes and there is a place that doesnt change that much
5247068 its a great way to see the ocean a totally different perspective
5247069 its eco tourism at its finest it doesnt leave a footprint
5247070 mm dd yy when the file is checked out of sccs reference page

5247073 litsite alaska uses narrative to inspire learning and community building
5247074 we bring people together through storytelling and are using ibms technology to give voice to hundreds of stories about alaska and the lives of alaskans contained within our vast and growing archive
5247075 if we had to record all of the stories ourselves the process would be too costly and time consuming
5247076 but with websphere voice server we can convert a page of text quickly and efficiently for a not for profit site the savings in time and resources are enormous litsite alaska is leveraging ibms technology to produce more audio content than its small staff of freelancers and contract workers could do on its own
5247077 alaskan storytelling is an art form and litsite is playing a critical role in continuing the tradition of preserving alaskan culture
5247078 as a leader in speech technology ibm is pleased to be playing a role in bringing alaskan tradition to life on the web through vocalizing traditional stories and native language
5247079 whats the big deal it cant be that big an issue and merely shrugged it off oh how wrong oh how very wrong i was
5247080 tengo un pinzamiento en el menisco y no s si voy a jugar lo tiene que valorar el m dico ma ana veremos si hace falta que me hagan una resonancia no puedo poner la pierna recta es doloroso pero por m jugar a sin una pierna
5247081 fue una hiperextensi n de la rodilla en uno de los muchos balones que nos robaron estos chicos que saltan tanto kobe bryant fue a hacer un mate y yo intent taponarle no llegu me ca y me doble la rodilla es doloroso vamos a ver lo que dice el m dico

5247084 aparte de los altibajos de la primera parte el equipo supo asentarse bien en la pista
5247085 lord how often shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him up to seven times
5247086 i do not say to you up to seven times but up to seventy times seven
5247087 for this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves
5247088 so the slave fell to the ground and prostrated himself before him saying have patience with me and i will repay you everything and the lord of that slave felt compassion and released him and forgave him the debt
5247089 but that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred b denarii and he seized him and began to choke him saying pay back what you owe so his fellow slave fell to the ground and began to plead with him saying have patience with me and i will repay you
5247090 but he was unwilling and went and threw him in prison until he should pay back what was owed
5247091 and his lord moved with anger handed him over to the torturers until he should repay all that was owed him
5247092 my heavenly father will also do the same to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your heart

5247165 were more interested in validating who the person is rather than validating the ticket this is more scientific than registering for the gym or anything like that we would be 100 per cent confident that this would stamp out touting
5247166 this is stopping the problem of one person buying a vast array of tickets and selling them on you just cant do it
5247167 we want to grow this service and we will be looking at other large events that we can do this at
5247168 what is remarkable about tickall is that despite being a relatively new idea the system has worked operationally even in its early stages in the future ticket touts systems like tickall will be incredibly valuable and will help to protect genuine music fans
5247169 with a summer as bad as this one it is tempting to make the most of every moment the sun is out
5247170 during the summer holidays the desire to look brown will also encourage many young people to use sunbeds prior to soaking up the sun on the beach
5247171 instead of enhancing a persons looks sunbathing and using sunbeds regularly will actually damage them
5247172 they lead to premature aging by causing skin to lose its smooth supple texture and become coarse leathery and wrinkled
5247173 getting sunburnt is easy even in a summer as bad as this one but it can double your risk of skin cancer and yet many still believe that going red on the beach or in the back garden is all part of getting a tan
5247174 its a real disaster for us this is normally one of the busiest ranks in edinburgh but we are losing out on a lot of the short haul fares that we would normally get every morning from commuters going to work
5247175 people who would normally come out the station and get a taxi up to the office are choosing to walk because we cant go straight there and have to take a large detour
5247176 ive had several passengers who have been a little bit surprised that their fare is larger than normal because of the detour we have to take and theres no question that we will lose more business from this
5247177 it is all about forward planning and we have done a lot of work with lothian buses to make sure that they are aware of everything that is happening we have also tried to make sure the drivers know about the works and so will take any detours necessary obviously as time goes on more people will become aware of this
5247178 gordon has recently applied for early retirement having given 34 years of commitment and hard work which has helped to ensure the safety and welfare of edinburgh residents and visitors alike
5247179 we sincerely thank gordon for his decades of service and wish him all the best for the future his retirement is a personal choice and any rumours to the contrary are completely unfounded
5247180 this came as a real shock to everyone his staff had no idea until thursday there was a health and social care committee meeting last tuesday which he was at but there was no mention of his departure to councillors
5247181 there are some malicious rumours around but the truth is that gordon was told to take early retirement by senior directors
5247182 wed been using the old site every single day for over 20 years the rationale for moving us was to get more public use of that stretch of canal but all they did was demolish the huts and the site is still empty
5247183 youve got a pyramid of performance if you start with 100 people over a number of years some of them will give up others will be happy to be recreational canoeists if youve got 20 that are talented and very determined one or two of those might make the olympics and one might medal
5247184 it would be an awful lot easier if we had better facilities its very difficult to coach people with such minimal facilities we do the best that we can but were absolutely flat out on the canal
5247185 the forth canoe club was based at lochrin basin but with the development of edinburgh quay and continuing regeneration of the area this location was no longer suitable
5247186 the clubs new facility funded by british waterways scotland at harrison park is a more suitable location with easier access to the water at a wider part of the canal
5247187 a secure facility to store training equipment was also provided the canoeists are able to use the union canal in either direction from this location
5247188 the woman who went over the bonnet last year was thankfully unharmed she just dusted herself down and accepted the drivers apology
5247189 the boy who ran into the side of the fire engine about two years ago just wasnt looking where he was going
5247190 the one i did report recently was a near miss at holy corner there was a woman who had just managed to get her buggy on the pavement and was leading her older children along and she was just about to get on the pavement herself when she let out a loud scream as the car went past
5247191 i think the driver must have misjudged the distance and he gave her a terrible fright
5247192 im worried for everyone at that crossing because theres a chance they wont see me stopping the traffic and will hit someone on the way across
5247193 theres already a crossing at the junction of bruntsfield avenue and my personal opinion as a driver is that a second one could cause frustration
5247194 obviously my answer would be to put in more crossing guards at certain times of day as they can override the lights when the road is particularly busy but let traffic flow at other times but as usual there is very little money in the council budget to employ them
5247195 the list was ranked in order of priority based on environmental factors such as its proximity to schools and playgrounds but the top priority crossing isnt necessarily the one that will get put in first
5247196 in some cases while local groups may be calling for the crossing to be put in it may later be decided that the crossing is not appropriate for that area for other reasons
5247197 firefighters had to use lines and a harness for crew safety
5247198 they managed to secure a rescue line to the dog and the dog was then lifted to safety and returned to its grateful owner
5247199 a local resident has taken care of the cat and it is going to be reunited with its owner later on
5247200 we did expect the figures to go down slightly as the purpose of the reforms was to take some cases like minor breaches of the peace and shoplifting and deal with them by fines
5247201 but what should then happen is the procurator fiscal has freed up time to deal with other cases instead were seeing those guilty of assault and caught by police never appearing in court
5247202 appearing in court with the evidence presented and the sheriff imposing a sentence is also part of the deterrent effect that is not replicated by posting a letter away to agree to a fine
5247203 its unacceptable that this soft touch scotland is allowed to continue
5247204 direct measures are not appropriate where prosecution would result in a sentence of imprisonment they are not an alternative to custody
5247205 police prosecutors and court staff have been working hard to implement the reforms which are beginning to tackle the significant problems faced under the old system where lengthy delays and repeated adjournments obstructed efficient effective justice caused added distress to victims and witnesses and left police languishing in court waiting rooms rather than in our communities
5247206 im just relieved ill be able to get on the bus again
5247207 i phoned them up and they said theyd send one out to me to show drivers i think every mother who asks for one now will get one if they phone up
5247208 id like people to hand one to the driver of every bus they get on saying they object to this policy whether they push a buggy or not
5247209 its so intimidating waiting for a bus and then not knowing whether youll be allowed on or not
5247210 what are you supposed to do if youve got a six week old baby who cant go in a foldable buggy its not possible to carry your baby all the time
5247211 the last thing lothian buses should be doing is alienating so many passengers

5247251 we already run a variety of physical activity sessions in the local community but demand for regular physical activity sessions suitable for older more frail people has grown beyond that which the projects can provide

5247255 this fire station should not be closed its a question of priorities
5247256 does not serve the best interests of the city as a whole
5247257 it mightve been that the people who made the decision believed it was the path of least resistance that the community around it would not respond
5247258 while the closure is unfortunate and i fully recognize the communitys historical ties to the station we have an opportunity to reduce city spending by 1 million while still providing the level of service required by national emergency response standards

5247302 i dont read headlines on the day of the game but my commitment is 100 per cent with the fans with the players and with the club in general
5247303 i say 100 times my family is happy here we want to win trophies at this club because it is a massive club
5247304 if we have problems because we are not doing things which in my opinion as a manager we could do i will work as hard as i can for the club
5247305 i do have some disappointment because we do not always have the same ideas but it doesnt matter because i will continue to fight

5247316 it means a lot to these guys now to see federer go down on his back after winning a semifinals of doubles it shows how important an olympic medal is to him
5247317 some players rise to the occasion when they play for their country some players get a little nervous
5247318 its different than a normal tournament its do or die its a lot of players last olympics its a lot of players first olympics and their only opportunity to get a medal and become a superstar in their country
5247319 we have seen a great evolution over the 20 years in olympic tennis with a medal becoming one of the most coveted prizes for our athletes
5247320 its kind of strange i never knew tennis existed in the olympics until four years ago
5247321 when i speak to some players now who didnt used to play the olympics back in maybe 1996 or 2000
5247322 i know that some of them have regrets that they didnt play it seeing how big the olympics has become in tennis and how important tennis has become to the olympics
5247323 i hope that by my presence and also rafas presence and the presence of roddick and lleyton hewitt in the past years i think thats only going make it more important for the future generations thats one of the reasons i play
5247324 there is an organized crime because that is what this is called
5247325 because it seems there is a lot of money hidden there a lot of profit
5247326 i am neither a policeman nor a detective nor a judge i dont have that knowledge and i think that the time has come for the state to do something and find a solution i believe that if they want to they will find it and i believe they do want to
5247327 whoever does such things gets mixed up in such things commits suicide and when someone wants to commit suicide nobody can stop them
5247328 of course it has to be organized when there are so many cases with the same substance

5247331 i dont hide it at all we are the ones who are giving this right we gave the right we are paying for old sins for this reason the ioc is indeed chasing us it is a fact that they are chasing us
5247332 i dont believe that the ioc has us in its sights or is after us

5247335 i cant repeat what i said at half time but i lost my rag because we were losing battles all over the pitch
5247336 it was powder puff stuff and im still angry now at what i saw in that first half but at least i got a response
5247337 i told the lads if a manager had said the same to me during my playing career i would have done everything possible in the second half to ram the words down his throat
5247338 a bomb call was made through 999 that a guest at a party had a pipe bomb in their possession but it was checked out and it was just a hoax

5247343 students feel secure to know if there has been an incident such as bullying we can then go back and look at what happened
5247344 no one really knows enough about the use of cctv in schools its a very new issue
5247345 certainly we would want staff to be involved in decisions about the use of cctv in schools and strict safeguards for its use although surveillance in schools can have some positive outcomes such as discouraging vandalism and violence we think there are some instances where it should be strictly controlled

5247386 me acuerdo de un partido del arsenal cuando le cedieron la pelota al portero del equipo contrario por el fair play pero con tan mala suerte que el portero no la pudo agarrar y fue gol para el arsenal stos siendo buenas personas se dejaron meter un gol del equipo contrario realmente ese es una demostraci n del juego limpio

5247414 we are encouraged by our results and our continued market share gains but the macro economic factors pressuring consumers and the ongoing challenges and uncertainty of the financial markets suggest a cautious sales forecast for the balance of fiscal 2008 is prudent we remain focused on positioning the company for long term success while managing through the near term challenges of the current environment

5247437 i wouldnt say theres a humanitarian catastrophe but theres an urgent need for primary products
5247438 im really heartbroken but in my way of life you are moved on after a certain number of years and my superior and his advisors suggested i take this change
5247439 i thought about it overnight and i remember when i was in rome for seven years and i was asked to come to belfast i thought it was the end of my life so when i was asked to leave here in conscience i couldnt say oh no i wont do that
5247440 we are going out on a quieter summer and i know the amount of hard work which went into that
5247441 we are pleased with our revenue and gross margin results in the second quarter and first six months of 2008 wholesale distribution was strong throughout the first half of 2008 for products which we produce and pharmaceutical products which we distribute that are produced by third party manufacturer much of our revenue growth last quarter was the result of a sales incentive program that temporarily offered our sales people higher than usual sales commissions
5247442 we continued to develop and acquire new pharmaceutical products throughout the second quarter and first six months of 2008 while supporting our current products and growing distribution network
5247443 we recently obtained the patent and exclusive production rights to a new asthma drug laevo bambutero which we plan to launch in 2012 after we receive approval from the sfda we currently have fourteen drugs for which we are seeking sfda approval and plans for manufacturing a number of new pharmaceutical products
5247444 in 2008 we expect strong revenue growth to be led by our distribution of pharmaceutical products manufactured by third parties and our best selling branded products for the full year 2008 because of our growing distribution network we remain confident that we will meet our make good net income target of 13 1 million
5247445 as part of our longer term growth strategy we began the process of acquiring land use rights on which to construct a product development and manufacturing facility that will allow us produce a wide range of new pharmaceutical products we hope to have the facility completed by the end of 2010 however we may adjust the time line depending on our availability of working capital and external funds we obtained the land use rights at a favorable price and may be able to monetize a portion of them in the future

5247463 no one really knows enough about the use of cctv in schools its a very new issue
5247464 certainly we would want staff to be involved in decisions about the use of cctv in schools and strict safeguards for its use although surveillance in schools can have some positive outcomes such as discouraging vandalism and violence we think there are some instances where it should be strictly controlled
5247465 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5247466 she met lindsay in the summer of 2006 at a party in malibu from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
5247467 back then samantha and lindsay didnt have a physical relationship
5247468 she once said samanthas the father i never had apparently samantha acted in a paternal way towards her giving her advice and cuddles
5247469 courtenay still cant understand how lindsay is now so open with samantha every time she sees a picture of them together it kills her

5247502 we still do not know exactly what happened to my brother and we probably never will
5247503 we only wish that he had been more aware of the dangers he was facing ben had not himself been exposed first hand to the devastating consequences of avalanches unlike some of his older team mates i just wish i could have warned my little brother
5247504 the remote possibility is that ben had been caught in a crevasse or hidden in a snowhole however he had only taken enough food water and gas for four to five days and it is now impossible that he could have survived at such an altitude
5247505 it is tragic that ben has met his fate in the same way
5247506 i didnt come to try and break records in that respect but to walk away with two medals so far im absolutely ecstatic eh
5247507 not in our performance more the fact that the way the competition runs with fastest teams against slowest youre going to catch people and its unfair some teams catch in the wrong place on the track and it slows you down
5247508 we were one of those unlucky teams last night we rode 57s for the second and third kilometre and then 59 for the last k
5247509 thats two seconds that we lost and we easily could have been in the final
5247510 those guys are so young they dont even realise what theyre doing right now its quite phenomenal to be riding 3 57 and one of the guys is 20
5247511 i just made a pact to myself id give everything 100 percent so when i came here id have no regrets and i dont have any

5247518 it is gratifying to progress the intellectual property of these compounds and look forward to future clinical trial results
5247519 there was a large crowd on site on auction day and very active bidding both here and over the internet
5247520 we set some exciting internet bidding records for our site with 50 percent of the registered bidders participating online live and in real time using rbauctionbid live and 146 internet buyers purchasing us 12 5 million of trucks and equipment internet bidders were winner or runner up bidder on 53 percent of the lots available online
5247521 we had been hit with the downturn in residential development in las vegas so we decided it made more sense to sell some of our equipment with ritchie bros rather than pay for it to sit idle
5247522 we were really pleased with the results on auction day
5247523 weve worked with ritchie bros for a number of years now as part of our normal business operations
5247524 one of their greatest advantages is their ability to draw such a large crowd from outside the united states whether they are bidding over the internet or at the auction site the fact that the equipment goes outside of our local market helps tremendously when the economy here is weak that international interest in our equipment makes all the difference
5247525 we also would never buy anything from any other auctioneer we have the trust in ritchie bros and their operations as both a seller and a buyer we mostly buy in person and when the equipment isnt available in australia we buy offshore it really works well for our business to make a trip to three or four ritchie bros auction sites and then come back home and bid online at the auctions we know what were bidding on and were not away from the business for long the internet system works well for us

5247547 chiranjeevi is not only a mega star on the screen it is true mega star in real life too its services are expected to reach a large segment of the population and that by entering politics
5247548 it would be nice if the decision chiranjeevi joined lok satta a difficult struggle may be given to the two main parties in 2009 elections
5247549 chiranjeevi has charisma beyond that of ntr but can it be the same status after entering politics why policy chiranjeevi

5247558 after the nazi conspirators threatened war the united kingdom and france concluded a pact with germany and italy at munich on 29 september 1938 involving the cession of the sudetenland by czechoslovakia to germany czechoslovakia was required to acquiesce on 1 october 1938 german troops occupied the sudetenland

5247560 sales results for q2 were significant as we continue to show robust revenue growth year over year

5247562 yes there is pressure back in nigeria to win the gold but thats normal were used to it back home they know exactly what this team is capable of and with us winning the gold medal in 1996 they are desperate for us to do it again
5247563 if you look at what ive done since the gaffer came to the club hes been an inspiration to me
5247564 im enjoying my work with him and i think hes making me improve as a player and hopefully i can keep doing that
5247565 hes shown a lot of belief in me and thats really important even if ive had bad games hes still played me he knows what players can do and he knows what i can do
5247566 it was a very close match between two hard working sides both teams had a lot of opportunities but they took their chances and we didnt
5247567 nigeria are a good side a mature side and a physical side that wins a lot of battles
5247568 this was our first olympics and we were a little excited and maybe that caused us to switch off for the goals only one of us could go through to the semis and unfortunately for us it was nigeria
5247569 hopefully we can qualify for south africa 2010 and perhaps you might see several of these players in the squad
5247570 today for one of the first times my players played to instruction and im actually very pleased with them
5247571 im glad we won and im glad were going to the semi finals
5247572 this was the best game weve played so far tactically weve been uncertain weve been continually unsure but today we looked good
5247573 we talked about how wed play against the ivorians and the players followed the plan
5247574 i spoke with ambose before the match and have him useful tips which really helped him i also spoke with my chief coach samson siasia and henry nwosu too so all this reassured the goalkeeper and brought out the best in him
5247575 vanzekin played below average in the match against usa but he has bounced back making so many daring saves in the match this was as a result of the dialogue we had with him which has now brought him back to life and once ambrose is doing well there is no stopping him
5247576 everybody played very well i cant figure out a player that didnt do well today they all put in their all to ensure we qualified to the semi final stage of this competition
5247577 they actually played a compact game marking well playing for each other and also helping each other in difficult situations in the match
5247578 i told you before the match that the game would be very tough but at the end of the end we are going to win so i have been proved right because i know the capabilities of my boys
5247579 i will however give kudos to the technical crew for turning around the team the team which could be given 25 percent in their match against the us now got my 90 percent in todays match
5247580 it is the work of the technical crew that has shown in just less than 48 hours the fortunes of the team has suddenly been turned around for the better

5247612 i think there is not enough understanding of the fact that in a democracy how you treat the security of the minority must be a very important part for the success of a democracy you cant only make token gestures and actually let them be in the state that they are as the rajinder sachar committee report shows so what happened is token gestures are made but real issues are never addressed
5247613 i wanted to buy a flat in bombay and it wasnt given to me because i was a muslim and i read the same about saif ali khan now i mean if javed akhtar and shabana azmi cannot get a flat in bombay because they are muslims then what are we talking about
5247614 thats why i am so distressed over what is happening in kashmir for heavens sake it should be brought to a stop and it should have been brought to a stop right when they started that nonsense

5247838 quando se come a a temporada com um empate frente ao bayern tem de se estar satisfeito
5247839 foi um jogo espectacular e um excelente arranque para mim e para a minha equipa
5247840 estou bastante desiludido pratic mos um bom futebol e fizemos um jogo convincente a minha equipa acreditou at final e merec amos ter chegado ao 3 3 mas come mos mesmo com uma derrota em casa sem somar pontos mau

5247851 no one can beat him in the 100 backstroke if he puts his mind to it hes just that good you cant explain it any other way you may never see another one
5247852 well have to see how keen he is on going to sprints
5247853 there is training involved with that i think he thinks it might be a little easier than it is i think he can sprint but i think hes more suited to longer events it will be a change for him but i think a good one
5247854 the question becomes why at some stage in the game youre going to want to come to a meet like this and swim a couple of events and have more of the experience of the event one of the things he doesnt get is almost any of that
5247855 im not doing it for the money im doing it because i love what i do
5247856 if bob and i were in it for the money i think wed be in different sports its definitely not about money im having fun at what i do and i do this because i love it
5247857 some of the greatest memories you have from meets like this are ones spent with your teammates there were a lot of rookies i really didnt know as well as others its been fun getting to know those other guys playing spades with them playing risk with them just hanging around relaxing
5247858 its one of the greatest memories just getting to be a part of team usa and be a part of the olympic team thats one of the greatest memories ill have from this
5247859 ive given everything ive got i tried so hard tonight
5247860 saya menganggap program ini suatu yang istimewa apabila menyanyikan semula lagu tradisional memang saya rindu dan teruja untuk menyanyi lagu sebegini
5247861 bagaimanapun ada perasaan bimbang kerana lama tidak menyanyi lagu tradisional tetapi menganggap persembahan ini satu latihan untuk menyiapkan album baru nanti yang turut menampilkan genre sama
5247862 pada mulanya tv3 mahu menggandingkan saya bersama saida sairah dan ayie untuk program raya ini tetapi akhirnya hanya kami bertiga yang bersetuju untuk menjayakannya
5247863 tentunya pengalaman ini menyeronokkan dan berharap peminat turut terhibur apabila menonton program itu nanti
5247864 program muzikal menampilkan konsep fusion tradisonal dan moden menjadikan ia unik serta berbeza dengan per sembahan siti sebelum ini selain tarikan siti bersama kakak dan adiknya program ini juga mengundang penari swatari dan 10 pemuzik pimpinan faizal uzir
5247865 menerusi kelainan yang ditampilkan program ini diharap dapat memberi kepuasan kepada penonton yang rindu menonton program tv berbeza sempena aidilfitri nanti
5247866 dulu kami hanya menyanyi secara suka suka tetapi kali ini kami menyanyi di hadapan peminat yang turut ditonton menerusi televisyen biarpun persembahan nampak lancar tetapi dalam hati perasaan gemuruh tetap ada
5247867 apa yang merisaukan saya jika tersasul atau lupa lirik ketika menyanyi namun siti sendiri memberi semangat kepada saya dan persembahan kami bertambah meriah apabila tiga beradik digandingkan bersama pada penghujung persem bahan ini
5247868 sungguhpun orang berkata saya menumpang populariti siti tetapi ia terpulang pada peminat untuk memberi tang gapan sedemikian sebagai kakak saya gembira dan ber bangga dengan pencapaian siti selama ini

5247875 i think the big problem is yahoo doesnt know what it wants to be when it grows up
5247876 its difficult to talk about mergers and acquisitions when you dont have a clear vision and i dont think yahoo has a clear vision right now
5247877 yahoo has none of those things and as long as thats the case theyre going to continue floundering theyre going to flounder if theyre talking about mergers and acquisitions and theyre going to flounder if theyre talking about management and continued operations of the company
5247878 those two guys represent a toe in the water in both the and subscription revenue worlds where yahoo is underperforming
5247879 if i were them id be pushing very actively on the agenda of what are we going to do to push from an underperformer to an overperformer in both of those segments what are you doing to build critical mass and share in those against google and the established 300 spartans on the telephony side
5247880 this is step two out of 10 not step eight out of eight
5247881 the more time they lose in these proxy battles and these pseudo proxy battles theyre giving google more time giving traditional telephony cellulars more time to respond
5247882 from a strategy perspective you want to keep any option open as long as theres not a compelling reason to close it
5247883 in this case theres no reason they should give up on the merger and acquisition front but as theyre doing that they should also try to come up with a clear and consistent plan
5247884 i think theyre going to have to do this on their own
5247885 i think looking for somebody to parachute in and buy the company really becomes the long shot and now its really taking yahoo back to whatever it is it wants to do when it grows up again
5247886 finding a company thats going to buy a property as expensive as yahoo particularly given the public nature of what happened during the microsoft thing is going to be tough in this market where everybodys watching their cash real closely its going to be double hard

5248020 its great to come here though with very little testing and on new tyres and be able to finish on the podium it was always going to be a big challenge to fight for a win as the other drivers have been competing all year and have been testing so the result feels very good and for sure we have made improvements with the setup and learnt about the tyres so there are many positives the experience will help for the next two tarmac events we are doing

5248052 hopefully what were going to bring at brand design is a seamless experience there are lots of digital companies that do customer up communication and a lot of branding agencies that do brand down communication which results in a 400 page book sitting on somebodys desk that youve got to follow what were trying to do now is form an idea and an expression of an idea in one place

5248054 those were better predictors of surgical skills than years of training and number of surgeries performed
5248055 so the first question you might ask your surgeon is how many of these surgeries have you done and the second question is are you a gamer

5248078 saya sangat menyesali hal ini dan meminta bupati ke depan supaya membuat sebuah peraturan yang menegaskan tentang pengibaran bendera merah putih dalam setiap parayaan hut ri
5248079 ini harus disikapi dengan segera karena untuk mengibarkan bendera saja tidak mau padahal dulu saya bersama teman teman dalam merebut kemerdekaan mempertaruhkan segalanya termasuk nyawa
5248080 kita akan cari tahun penyebab rumah tersebut tidak mengibarkan bendera merah putih itu jika memang tidak bisa membeli bendera akan diberikan gratis

5248085 cedera di kaki kanannya itu sudah menjadi masalah sejak enam tahun lalu bahkan sebelum olimpiade athena 2004
5248086 pada 16 agustus 2008 ketika kami sampai di perkampungan atlet dokter menganalisa cedera kaki liu dan menyatakan bahwa ada masalah pada urat tumitnya
5248087 saya rasa masyarakat china akan memahami situasi ini dan akan mendukung liu untuk kembali bertanding lagi menunjukkan performa terbaiknya
5248088 saya datang ke sini khusus untuk menonton dia bertanding saya baru membeli satu tiket olimpiade sudah berakhir buat saya sama seperti liu xiang

5248102 has the potential to change the way people do archaeology
5248103 this approach really brings in the computer as a research partner to archaeologists
5248104 we mimic the archaeologists methods as much as possible so that they can really use our system as a tool
5248105 when fully developed this system could reduce the time needed to reconstruct a wall from years to months it could free up archaeologists for other valuable tasks such as restoration and ethnographic study
5248106 this showed that the system could work in a real life situation
5248107 having this ability to really exhaustively try everything very quickly could potentially be quite helpful

5248135 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5248136 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5248137 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5248138 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5248139 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
5248140 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
5248141 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
5248142 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
5248143 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e
5248144 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
5248145 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades
5248146 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
5248147 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
5248148 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
5248149 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
5248150 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
5248151 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
5248152 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
5248153 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
5248154 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
5248155 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
5248156 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
5248157 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
5248158 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
5248159 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables

5248161 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
5248162 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
5248163 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
5248164 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
5248165 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
5248166 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
5248167 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos

5248171 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5248172 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5248173 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5248174 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5248175 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5248176 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones

5248181 all attempts to link the autism with vaccines scientifically have failed and the methods used by the anti vaccine crowd to spread this myth are denialist to the last drop they allege outrageous conspiracies implicating everyone from the cdc to the fda to the average family doc
5248182 routine childhood immunization with the 7 vaccines was cost saving from the direct cost and societal perspectives with net savings of 9 9 billion and 43 3 billion respectively
5248183 gee it turns out somebody already did that research and the results were that vaccines have nothing to do with autism
5248184 this was going to do more good in terms of changing policy if it came out in october than if it came out in november

5248197 the problem with the lancet study is almost no one believes it
5248198 what kane is doing is gaining publicity for himself so our choices are to ignore him or google bomb him associate some phrase such as

5248203 i think bpl is happy to just leave it be and i think you should as well
5248204 an anti christian bigot whose anti christianism is no morally different than anti semitites or hatred of black people
5248205 that you want to extrapolate this into something else is rather silly
5248206 what makes you an anti christian bigot is your assumption that a christian must have evil political views
5248207 im being facetious of course but the frequency of extremist politics and poor ethical conduct among biologists sometimes makes me wonder i cite a few examples below in alphabetical order by last name its not an exhaustive list by any means what is it with biologists richard dawkins the noted science writer and proponent of the scientifically dubious sociobiology now usually called evolutionary psychology is a militant anti religion crusader and has a pathological hatred of christians in general and roman catholics in particular
5248208 and if the ten thousand year reich had lived surely christianity had no long term role to play
5248209 take over the churches from within using party sympathizers discredit jail or kill christian leaders and re indoctrinate the congregants give them a new faith in germanys third reich
5248210 but the original contention was that hitler or the nazis were somehow tied to christianity
5248211 the nazis were much more inclined to use the churches as allies than to persecute them and the churches were happy to go along with the compromises so they could avoid trouble
5248212 educational instruction was designed to ensure that the verf gungstruppe soldier was a fanatical nazi unquestioningly obedient and ready to carry out any order from the dictator chancellor a flood of anti christian propaganda was loosed on the heads of the men to compel them to renounce all the rules of bourgeois christian morality and to sever all ties with the church on every parade and during every instructional period the cry was one pace forward anyone who has not yet left the church every opportunity was taken to humiliate and ridicule them of 300 catholics the church leavers totalled 4 in 1937 3 in 1938 67 in 1940 and 129 in 1942 the young verf gungstruppe officers were continually called upon to prove their uncompromising opposition to the christian message of reconciliation and tolerance which the ss regarded as un german from the outset they were ordered to abjure the christian faith as a destructive effeminate and jewish doctrine

5248221 the application for the wind turbines should be withdrawn until such a time when all the relevant information gained from the placement of the meteorological mast can be evaluated this would mean that the cart is put behind the horse not in front
5248222 both states have the potential to contribute a considerably larger quantity of wind power than they currently do
5248223 if voters pass the renewable portfolio standard in november precedent suggests that missouri will be successful in meeting its goal
5248224 missouri should think in terms of hitting a 15 to 20 percent target with its own wind resources
5248225 exporting is probably not an option but it wouldnt need to acquire wind energy from other states
5248226 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes

5248230 pilot mark believes the myth that the plane will be held in place by the belt
5248231 additionally the obvious intention of the myth is to give a clear difference in the possible outcomes either it flies or it is held stationary and measuring the speed relative to the ground will never give this clear difference even a car will achieve a speed relative to the ground of half the speed shown on its speedometer so much so that if a plane was fitted with wings which caused it to take off at 50mph it could achieve a speed of 100mph on the speedometer and it would take off

5248244 were talking about a pretty small additional increase to get these animals out of these horrible crammed cages
5248245 itll just make california more dependent on other states and other countries for eggs

5248254 is it as good of a site as we think or is it too extreme
5248255 that was my first thing im not going to keep pursuing it if it doesnt have support at the forest service level
5248256 we face the ridiculous situation of defra and other government departments saying they believe there is no risk from noise because renewable energy companies have told us so
5248257 this indicates that in a sense the industry is being allowed to set its own standards which is clearly wrong
5248258 they produce a constant background noise that might at best be described as tolerable but under certain conditions this can change to include a sharp high frequency whiplash type noise
5248259 if the wind blows in gusts the turbines in a sense resist this and create a very disturbing noise that households maybe half a mile away will certainly hear
5248260 they can cause a very real problem for nearby households but im sure for many people this is not something they would know to worry about
5248261 we can easily consider the impact of a turbine on the landscape but for noise issues you often dont find out how bad they can be until they are built
5248262 it is not unusual for secondments to take place between berr and industry or vice versa we take great care in avoiding any potential for conflict of interest indeed there is regular parliamentary scrutiny of the secondments programme
5248263 clear guidance is set out for local planning authorities advising they ensure renewable energy developments have been located and designed in such a way to minimise increases in ambient noise levels
5248264 i personally think that this is a pretty good start
5248265 as weve done in the past if somethings screwed up we change it
5248266 i dont think well see thousands of these in our area but you are going to see some
5248267 youre taking what tools that we have and tying our hands behind our backs

5248270 no matter how much power government has it never has enough
5248271 the most difficult thing about politics is dealing with people with really bad breath
5248272 never run a 100 yard dash in a 90 yard room
5248273 once you create a bureaucracy it is near to impossible to ever get rid of it
5248274 though the area is shifting to the democrats its still a very moderate area
5248275 suddenly this once republican town is voting democratic in off years
5248276 i think the same thing you saw in the south with democrats in the 70s and 80s youre seeing in the northeast now with republicans
5248277 what youve seen is that republicans were successful in the northeast when they were a more moderate to liberal party
5248278 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20m hectares across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
5248279 nor is it limited to the countries and cities with the lowest gdp it is prevalent in many mid income countries as well
5248280 as long as developing countries lack suitable transport to deliver large quantities of perishable produce to urban areas urban agriculture will remain important in the face of water scarcity generally and a lack of access to clean water urban farmers will have no alternative except to use polluted water
5248281 many rivers in developing countries and emerging economies are now polluted to the brink of collapse for example the yangtze chinas longest river is suffering because of pollution by untreated waste agricultural run off and industrial discharge
5248282 it appears there is no democratic support on the committee for susan dudley
5248283 collins declined to say whether republicans on the committee also objected to the nomination
5248284 so that sensitive individuals can take appropriate exposure avoidance behavior
5248285 wasnt it following what god told them to do that got them into this situation
5248286 i was fired to have to work hard take a bruising to my ego to feel humiliated to feel scared to start another job or business starting at the beginning and to learn that i could trust jesus my lord and my god in all these situations that was my promotion
5248287 my ministry is my life and my life is my ministry
5248288 the attack was short sharp and deadly enough to send the georgians fleeing in humiliating panic
5248289 the western media especially cnn is feeding you complete horseshit russia did not invade georgia first
5248290 missile defense washington and poland just moved the world closer to war
5248291 the signing now insures an escalation of tensions between russia and nato and a new cold war arms race in full force it is important for readers to understand the ability of one of two opposing sides to put anti missile missiles to within 90 miles of the territory of the other in even a primitive first generation anti missile missile array gives that side virtual victory in a nuclear balance of power and forces the other to consider unconditional surrender or to pre emptively react by launching its nuclear strike before 2012
5248292 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe is aimed at the russian federation
5248293 us troops on monday july 14 began military exercises near the russian border in ex soviet ukraine and were poised to launch them in georgia amid tense relations between moscow and washington a ceremony inaugurating the sea breeze 2008 nato exercise was held off ukraines black sea coast against anti nato protests and a hostile reaction from officials in russia sea breeze 2008 includes forces from armenia azerbaijan belgium britain canada denmark france georgia germany greece latvia macedonia and turkey the us georgia joint exercises will be held at the vaziani military base less than 100 kilometers 60 miles from the russian border with a total of 1 650 servicemen taking part
5248294 this is a formula for an injection of us military and naval forces into georgia of indeterminate scope and duration it will certainly involve the presence of hundreds if not thousands of uniformed us military personnel on the ground and a substantial number of warships in the region the us is introducing this military force into a situation that remains highly unstable and combustible raising the possibility of a direct military clash between the united states and russia
5248295 with the imprio hd2200 the disk drive industry for the first time has a nanopatterning system capable of patterned media advanced development and pilot production
5248296 this is our second generation nanopatterning system for the hdd market and it is demonstrating our ability to extend our core step and flash r imprint lithography technology to enable our customers to continue meeting their patterned media roadmaps its adoption by manufacturing leaders like yamagata fujitsu further validates our s fil technology as being uniquely suited to meeting their performance and cost of ownership challenges
5248297 egotist a person more interested in himself than in me
5248298 if everything goes well im hoping we can get some soccer and football fields ready for the kids this fall
5248299 weve been working on this lease for a decade and itll be good to get things really going finally
5248300 after receiving complaints from nearby businesses about the level of noise from market traders at particular times we felt that we had to officially ask the operators if they would tone this down
5248301 we must stress that we appreciate that calling out is part of the standard practice on markets but we had to agree with people working in the area that on some occasions this has gone beyond what is felt to be reasonable
5248302 we talked directly to the traders about this on a number of occasions before sending this letter which is not asking them to stop calling only to reduce the volume and frequency of the calling
5248303 this is absolutely ridiculous theres nothing left in this country anymore
5248304 shouting is part of the colour and vibrancy of markets and creates a lot of jollity and banter
5248305 this is the best position for the rest of the season to be top and for citroen to lead the manufacturers new zealand though will be difficult as there is always a lot of gravel on the road there we saw what happened in turkey and that could happen in new zealand as well
5248306 but i am happy to be in the lead of the championship we are four points clear so that is good
5248307 after beating our main rival on his home event we had no intention of letting anybody else take victory in germany
5248308 our c4 wrc handled perfectly impeccably from start to finish and we got our tyre calls right every time switching from the pirelli soft and hard options as a function of the conditions
5248309 we worked hard every day but the result was as you see and its really hard to take
5248310 i really wanted to be next to lius lane because he is such a big champion
5248311 people were shouting because they couldnt believe he was finished
5248312 coming down on the last lap i had to throw whatever i had left
5248313 now is a terrific time for renewables to launch i hope they get all the capital they need and all the great minds and talent but i dont want it to come at the expense of the oil and gas industry
5248314 as goes colorado so goes the west as far as this energy policy debate
5248315 the future in colorado is building wind farms in wheat fields
5248316 quite frankly its how we should have been thinking for 10 years
5248317 at the heart of our portal is that you can get a lot of information from the community
5248318 theres been user generated content in investing for a long time but its been in the form of discussion boards
5248319 with discussion boards things tend to fall off the bottom of the page and theres little incentive to make a really good post our site gives people a platform where they can share their knowledge
5248320 weve put in mechanisms to help prevent stuff like that
5248321 people are encouraged to build a long term reputation on the site
5248322 the only people who bother to spend a lot of time writing are the people who actually know something about the topic
5248323 i was frustrated that the personal finance blogosphere didnt really have a center spot
5248324 so i began putting together a catalog of personal finance blogs with listings by topic i came up with a framework that i hoped would make it easier for readers to find out the main theme of a blog i gave the opportunity for people to list their main topics give a summary of their blogs purpose and their views and even link to their best posts i hoped that this would be useful for readers to find blogs which fit what they were looking for and that bloggers would be willing to participate because it was free advertising
5248325 now that the former part is doing well id like to get more personal finance information itself on the site
5248326 sort of a stage two what are index funds what is a 401 k
5248327 i think its currently unique for its focus on the blogosphere for both bloggers and readers
5248328 there are lots of great finance facts in for example but nothing ive seen about personal finance blogs accumulating finance information is only one of the finwikians goals the main goal being to link people to sites which will provide them a more daily dose if they subscribe
5248329 people like to have a voice and they like flexibility
5248330 nothing is static on a wiki you can add your own blog listing or point of view to a topic then readers like to be able to find information quickly i hope people like this one because it helps them find useful information even if thats not on the wiki itself
5248331 mick lowie as well as roberto and kellie maniaci have been instrumental in the success of this event through the support of the cny mustang all fords club
5248332 its nothing against nick but unlike kubica he is not a driver who can win a world championship
5248333 if you can secure an alonso for the long term then you must
5248334 whats the business case what are we trying to accomplish
5248335 oh no we couldnt possibly do that this car is on allocation and the buyers want the odometer to read as close to zero as possible
5248336 with the demand for these cars oh no sir no way but let me show you the krypton green one in the garage
5248337 what can i do to get you to buy this car today
5248338 okay you seem like a sincere guy you can have it for sticker if you buy it today
5248339 i still need to see if i can actually drive it it is a bit extreme you know
5248340 how about to the end of the block and back
5248341 there is nothing more insulting to an icelander than to be called danish
5248342 may things go for you according to the deserts of those who have a purpose in life
5248343 be it great or small it doesnt matter just as long as they are determined not to harm others

5248351 the door has been opened i want to work hard and prove im not just a token woman or figurehead
5248352 we have been asking for years via the media and academics and education experts and officials to be allowed the right to practice sports
5248353 there is nothing in the religion that bans this its only our tradition and culture that are driving this ban until now
5248354 i posted this video because i wanted people to know that there are saudi women as well asking for this right
5248355 they were the closest to us before the war and now they are the most frightening enemy
5248356 it feels like your own brother has cut off your head
5248357 after what happened it should be clear that they should have self determination
5248358 the reality is that for 15 years at least south ossetia and abkhazia have been independent in fact
5248359 its not true the goal of russia is peace in the caucasus
5248360 ive been thinking about it ever since kyle hamilton told reporters sunday about the disappointing finish in 2004
5248361 i never thought id get the opportunity to be a favourite in an olympics again
5248362 just to come in as a favourite is an amazing experience to do it twice is just amazing and to win i cant say anymore
5248363 i knew that we had won it there was nobody coming back at that point coxswain brian price told reporters sunday in beijing as he talked about raising his arms near the finish line
5248364 we started everything we could in the first 500 to get ourselves into the race and essentially through the middle its a dogfight everybody wants a piece of it said ian brambell of the mens four crew
5248365 we knew that we had a really solid 500 and it was just a matter of not waiting for it but going everyone together we closed the eyes and went for it
5248366 coming into the last 500 we seemed to get our rhythm and ian said go for it we committed everything we had and went said parsons
5248367 we knew it was tight we really had no idea where we were when we started that sprint
5248368 it was exhausting there wasnt anything left in the end
5248369 when we looked over i could see that our bow ball was definitely in front of the germans it was just making sure the judges were with us
5248370 after our first two races we kind of had a tendency of sort of getting caught in the last 500 so we made it our mission to really execute that last 500 and lay it all down on the line and i think we did that
5248371 the women were solidly in third place until the last 100 yards when they were edged out
5248372 it was a hard race i think the first half took a lot out of me for the second half i just couldnt be happier
5248373 theyre not predicting exactly where these medals will come from
5248374 for more than a decade the audiences for most traditional news sources have steadily declined as the number of people getting news online has surged
5248375 a sizable minority of americans find themselves at the intersection of these two long standing trends in news consumption
5248376 the block copolymer lattice is sort of fooled by these pillars and forms its array around them they form a nice ordered pattern around the pillars
5248377 by properly choosing the spatial distribution of the pillars to match a desired final structure it was possible to consistently generate defect free polymer nanostructures
5248378 nature allows you to get these really well ordered structures without doing much work
5248379 the state of the industry in magnetic media is really ready for this
5248380 the ultimate goal would be a complete self assembling chip structure
5248381 ultimately this is a technology that is very high resolution and very scalable

5248395 i came here to make a forward step in my career and i know people expect a lot from me when i arrived though no one said i was the successor to alexander hleb or anything like that
5248396 we play very different football me and hleb so i am going to try and bring my kind of game and play well week in week out
5248397 to start with a win is good after our performance in liege it was important to get the three points and regain confidence
5248398 it was a professional performance at sunderland it wasnt the best or most spectacular display but we knew they would be a tough team to play and that they would be motivated on the opening day but we did our job
5248399 it was an ideal start we comfortably beat the fa cup winners and we played some attractive football under the new manager we fulfilled what we set out to achieve
5248400 in the first match of the season i have kept a clean sheet which is always good and pleases me twice as much
5248401 it is also important that our fans are satisfied with our performance while another positive is that our new players deco and jose bosingwa started well
5248402 on wednesday we will get to play england at wembley
5248403 it is something different to play there at club level than it is with the national team

5248427 our organic growth strategy of diversifying by both specialist discipline and geography has enabled us to achieve these record results and be more robust and resilient with an increasingly difficult economic environment in some markets being balanced by others that remain strong
5248428 the further you get from london the better it gets
5248429 with 50 per cent of the groups gross profit being generated from non finance and accounting professional disciplines and 21 per cent of group gross profit being generated from temporary placements it is clear that the composition of the group is significantly more diverse and robust than when market conditions were difficult in the early 1990s and 2000s

5248436 ashley has been fantastic for us im pleased gabby and john have signed new contracts and weve got a couple more players that we are looking to do exactly the same with with ashley young being one of them
5248437 we are in conversation about that i dont think the chairman randy lerner has any major problem about sorting out wages for people if they are doing the business week in and week out on the pitch
5248438 agbonlahor has done that in my two seasons here carew has been terrific since being swapped with milan baros at lyon and young has been absolute class
5248439 it means he will get a new contract ashley hasnt come and asked for anything
5248440 he has got a number of years left to run on his contract but id like to sort him out and i am sure he is enjoying his football here which is great
5248441 if he continues to play in the fashion he is for us who knows what might happen to him in the future but we would be delighted to keep him a bit longer
5248442 as far as england is concerned his time will come today was a great start for him
5248443 i was a bit surprised that ashley young wasnt in the squad but his time will come as well ive no doubts whatsoever that will happen

5248451 but he said just because ive won this grammy it doesnt mean i wont work on your record i had to party with cee lo too to get him to work on the record
5248452 in reading the acknowledgments in your book i saw the name roger stitt do you know if his wifes name is toby ann
5248453 i went to high school with the stitts sons when i saw rogers name i recalled that it was at their home where i attended my first ever bible study at the time i was not attending church services or even had an inkling of god but the stitts would open their home to a bunch of high school kids feed us and lead us in a bible study as i reflect on that i realize it was there that my call into ministry was first nurtured do you know how i can get in touch with roger
5248454 sure do hes in my ceo group that meets for five hours once a month every second thursday todays the day roger and i will be having lunch together in about thirty minutes give me your number rob so i can pass it along to roger heres his number and i will tell him to expect your call
5248455 roger did toby ann and you ever hold a bible study in your home for high school kids
5248456 kevin we did a bible study for years when my kids were going through winter park high school nothing ever came of it except we spent a lot of time and money feeding a bunch of kids it was probably just a wasted effort why

5248475 the company runs a national television advertisement to convince the canadian public that shell is acting responsibly in restoring the land to its former state the ad shows a few grazing bison and a shell employee in a field of barley talking to a group of local aboriginal elders the voice over claims that shell is getting advice from the natives on how to restore the land this begs the obvious question what do natives know about restoring the land theyll teach you how to gut a moose but they dont know how to restore the land for the simple reason that theyve never destroyed it

5248546 that law is unjust because it violates the right to free speech
5248547 that law is counterproductive because it infringes on free speech and free speech brings the following benefits to the culture
5248548 hear hear the problem with such cultural relativism is that by denying the universality of human rights one no longer has a principled defense of their own freedom if we excuse such deprivations of liberty as justifiable because that culture does not hold the same values we do how then can we take a stand against our own cultures deprivations of liberty for ourselves or others if we make all such violations simply a matter of majority rule we have no principled objection when the majority in our own nations choose to violate our own rights rights then become something granted by government and therefore subject to withdrawal by government rather than a value that cannot be justly violated by any government when we begin to think in such ways liberty will inevitably wither
5248549 the rights we possess are exactly equal to the rights the culture grants
5248550 the rights we possess should be list which society should grant
5248551 come on in sarahs in the living room with the baby
5248552 have you decided on a name yet its been over a month since he was born right
5248553 uh yes yes it has and no we havent decided on a name its tricky and weve been mulling over a few ideas but we never expected to be naming a car speaking names perhaps we all better introduce ourselves for the record
5248554 of course silly me okay im jim morrigan here with phillip matthews our photographer interviewing harold and sarah french in their lovely home
5248555 from the outside you wouldnt expect this to be anything but the average family home and your expectations would be right inside is the model of normal suburban life painted with a multitude of vw beetle paraphrenalia from pictures to models
5248556 so harold sarah this all must be pretty exciting for you a new addition to the family your first child
5248557 why dont you tell me a little about yourselves how long have you 2 been married how long have youve been interested in beetles
5248558 we met about 10 years ago at an airport wed both been waiting for almost 24 hours i was going on holiday and so was he and having spent so much time not talking to each other we thought we might as well talk and things went on from there
5248559 no no we both ended up cancelling everything in the end i didnt relish paying for a taxi and a train journey home and so harold offered to drive me back we were both really tired which is probably why neither of us realised that we both lived in completely different directions poor harold dropped me off and then realised that hed now need to drive almost 80 miles to get home i offered to let him sleep on the couch but he was so shy he said he wouldnt want to intrude a stranger in my home and so hed sleep in his car in the driveway you really were a funny thing back then harold
5248560 dont worry harold im just recording all this for notes this isnt going on the radio or anything
5248561 so how did you two get interested in beetles just looking around the home i can see they are a big part of your life
5248562 well im afraid to say im not that interested at all its all sarahs obsession im just an innocent bystander
5248563 yes its true its all me im afraid ive always loved them ever since school even before some girls had barbie some girls had my little ponies i had beetles and ive never given them up since i think its probably all my fathers fault hes a mechanic and he always used to take me to work and show me how all the cars worked
5248564 so sarah harold what do you think happened weve all heard the speculations and accusations and weve seen the medical proof that this wasnt some kind of ruse but what we havent heard is your take on all this how do you think this happened

5248572 part of it is common sense and being respectful one of my colleagues used to work for a company that decided it needed to downsize the company took the bizarre step of announcing who would be laid off in stages with each announcement coming on a friday the 13th this creates fear and tension among employees and also creates an us vs them mentality there werent any disasters on that occasion but its not hard to imagine tensions boiling over
5248573 if you need to lay this type of person off its important to be very explicit about why they were chosen and why this was a logical decision if its because of economic reasons be very clear that its because of economic reasons otherwise the tendency to believe theyre out to get me often takes over
5248574 one of the worst things you can do is create ambiguity while the managers might think they are sparing feelings they are also giving ex employees an opportunity to spin conspiracy theories which fuel anger and resentment be kind and respectful but also as candid as possible
5248575 a big problem with these reactions is that they dont always go away once the stress is reduced people become addicted to alcohol or irreparably harm their reputation at work or their relationships with family members fortunately the really dramatic stress related incidents like workplace shootings are rare
5248576 reducing bad stress often can be done by reducing bureaucracy and listening to employees concerns to see if they can be addressed what you generally dont want to do is try to reduce employees overall stress levels by taking away the good stress the aspects of a job they find enjoyable and energizing
5248577 while you cant really make a habit out of letting employees shirk their duties at work every time they have a personal problem any steps that can be taken to reduce the bad stress these employees have to deal with will go a long way toward helping them ride out a tough time

5248591 s vezes voc tem que jogar como time pequeno fechado e no contra ataque
5248592 na minha carreira sempre tive grandes equipes e conquistei t tulos jogando de maneira ofensiva fora agredindo o advers rio e sabendo se defender n o vou mudar meu estilo pra jogar de uma maneira que n o acho a ideal em fun o de um momento

5248598 this is for the first time i have received an award which is not completely related to films
5248599 i have grown watching rajiv ji and have always admired him for his ideologies and vision its a great achievement to receive an award by his name
5248600 this award is special to me because of two reasons first the award is in memory of a person whom i admired because of his visionary power and secondly it has been awarded by deshmukh ji

5248605 the film is very costly because of its location the shooting equipment and the international artistes involved kerala is a small place and so it is only once in a blue moon that we can churn out such high budget films
5248606 i have a couple of offers and that too some irresistible ones but at the moment i have a lot of commitments in the malayalam film industry

5248609 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5248610 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

5248614 hca already engages itself for 60 years in supporting the needs of handicapped children in the us friends and business partners in the us have confirmed that hca is a trustworthy organisation therefore it was clear to us that we would support hca through helpchrity
5248615 we are incredibly excited by the launch of this home schooling course
5248616 it has taken a huge amount of development and organization not the least of which was sourcing experts in differing fields who also have the ability to teach and pass their enthusiasm on to a student we are deliberately screening out the passionate bores
5248617 we designed this course as an offering to parents that arent necessarily looking for a full time live in tutor but need something to enrich their childs home education parents can pick and choose which topics they want to have delivered and we identify an expert in the field for the parents approval depending on the length of the modules up to twelve in depth special projects could be delivered per year enriching the childs home education and allowing them to really get stuck into a particular topic with an expert
5248618 they really do vary and the special projects can cover more than one discipline at a time making a wildlife pond for example could explore principles in biology mathematics ecology design and so on on the other hand shorter courses focusing on one area can be delivered for example a series of two week courses has recently been commissioned for a thirteen year old boy in canada its designed to explore the concept of rebels in literature and determine whether there really is such a thing as a rebel in the first place i can confidently say
5248619 that these kinds of courses are not available elsewhere especially not tailored to the needs of an individual child and family
5248620 i am leaving with the satisfaction that whatever i could do for this country i did it with integrity

5248622 for building a new life where else but on the ruins of your past
5248623 we will not call off the bandh we are for a tripartite meeting and the question of withdrawing the bandh will depend on the course of discussions in a tripartite meeting
5248624 it would be too early to comment anything in this contest
5248625 we want to see darjeeling prosper and are ready to help we want the gorkhas to have their own identity and we morally support them
5248626 if the bandh in the darjeeling hills continues the situation in the state would be unmanageable
5248627 as part of the emergency measures to meet any eventuality that may occur during the indefinite bandh convened by the gjmm in the darjeeling hills the state food and civil supplies department has been asked to ration petrol and lpg and stock up essential foodgrains
5248628 staying quiet would send wrong signals to the state government and the centre our commitment to the cause is fixed
5248629 more efforts should be made to enhance the standard of living of the people of darjeeling as well as to improve the economic and social conditions of the people there without changing the geographical contours of west bengal the issue of expanding the administrative and financial powers of the darjeeling gorkha hill council can be considered with sympathy
5248630 party member gopal singh chhetri who attended gurungs meeting was not authorised to do so by the kolkata headquarters
5248631 he has violated the partys decision and we shall take action against him
5248632 the politician who attended the hill meeting saying he belonged to the congress is not even an office bearer
5248633 our representative was sent to attend the meeting though what he said was entirely his personal opinion
5248634 we havent received any formal communication from the external affairs minister but we have made our point clear we are interested in a tripartite meeting and nothing else we will go to delhi for talks on a one point agenda gorkhaland we will go to delhi to meet central government leaders and tell them our grievances
5248635 there is no question of creating a separate state of gorkhaland the centre doesnt want further disintegration of the state
5248636 we are against division of our state gjm chief bimal gurung may have some genuine issues that he wants to sort out within the ambit of the constitution we can always have a discussion on such issues like giving more economic power to the hill authorities
5248637 this is the real time when the gardens make profits that will help them carry on their operations for the rest of the year if they miss out on the high realization for this time of the year darjeeling gardens at the end of the year will end up making losses
5248638 exports have been hampered in a big way and over all the image of indian tea in the sense of giving commitments also has suffered a set back
5248639 sikkim is losing at least 100 million rupees 2 3 million every day from the agitation in darjeeling
5248640 the strike has cut off supplies of fuel rations and other items to the forward locations guarded by our soldiers
5248641 in my earlier letter to gjm for talks we did not set any condition we still do not have any pre condition
5248642 we want a solution to the problem be it through a bipartite or tripartite meeting but this requires preparation of the ground for this there is a greater need to exchange views with the centre as also with the agitators
5248643 we will have to stand together and convince the leaders of gjm that bandhs will not solve any problem what we need is a political dialogue

5248651 it is primarily because most of the mumbai media hobnobs and rubs shoulders with the film people

5248675 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5248676 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5248677 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5248678 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5248679 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5248680 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5248681 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5248682 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5248683 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5248684 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5248685 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5248686 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5248687 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5248688 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5248689 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5248690 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5248691 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5248692 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

5248706 this is an epic event were talking about the end of a 20 year secular credit expansion that went absolutely parabolic from 2001 2007
5248707 before the us economy can truly begin to expand again the savings rate must rise to pre bubble levels of 8pc that the us housing stocks must fall to below eight months supply and that the household interest coverage ratio must fall from 14pc to 10 5pc
5248708 its important to note what sort of surgery that is going to require we will probably have to eliminate 2 trillion of household debt to get there

5248726 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5248727 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5248728 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5248729 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5248730 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5248731 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5248732 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5248733 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

5248749 part of it is common sense and being respectful one of my colleagues used to work for a company that decided it needed to downsize the company took the bizarre step of announcing who would be laid off in stages with each announcement coming on a friday the 13th this creates fear and tension among employees and also creates an us vs them mentality there werent any disasters on that occasion but its not hard to imagine tensions boiling over
5248750 if you need to lay this type of person off its important to be very explicit about why they were chosen and why this was a logical decision if its because of economic reasons be very clear that its because of economic reasons otherwise the tendency to believe theyre out to get me often takes over
5248751 one of the worst things you can do is create ambiguity while the managers might think they are sparing feelings they are also giving ex employees an opportunity to spin conspiracy theories which fuel anger and resentment be kind and respectful but also as candid as possible
5248752 a big problem with these reactions is that they dont always go away once the stress is reduced people become addicted to alcohol or irreparably harm their reputation at work or their relationships with family members fortunately the really dramatic stress related incidents like workplace shootings are rare
5248753 reducing bad stress often can be done by reducing bureaucracy and listening to employees concerns to see if they can be addressed what you generally dont want to do is try to reduce employees overall stress levels by taking away the good stress the aspects of a job they find enjoyable and energizing
5248754 while you cant really make a habit out of letting employees shirk their duties at work every time they have a personal problem any steps that can be taken to reduce the bad stress these employees have to deal with will go a long way toward helping them ride out a tough time

5248783 the pleasure given by wine is always rapidly mounting after which as rapidly it declines that from opium when once generated is stationary for eight to ten hours the first to borrow a technical distinction from medicine is a case of acute the second of chronic pleasure the one is a flickering flame the other a steady and equable glow but the main distinction lies in this that whereas wine disorders the mental faculties opium on the contrary if taken in a proper manner introduces amongst them the most exquisite order legislation and harmony
5248784 it is a significant fact that both in england and in this country the total abstinence movement was almost immediately followed by an increased consumption of opium
5248785 opium has been recently made from white poppies cultivated for the purpose in vermont new hampshire and connecticut the annual production being estimated by hundreds of pounds and this has generally been absorbed in the communities where it is made it has also been brought here from florida and louisiana while comparatively large quantities are regularly sent east from california and arizona where its cultivation is becoming an important branch of industry 10 acres of poppies being said to yield in arizona twelve hundred pounds of opium

5248791 between 1840 and 1850 soon after teetotalism had become a fixed fact that our own importations of opium swelled
5248792 opium chewing has become very prevalent especially since the use of alcoholic drinks has been to so great an extent abandoned under the influence of the fashion introduced by total abstinence societies

5248842 in a long time we have never had such a high degree of volatility and a high degree of forecast risk
5248843 of course that would be pretty dire you would imagine for oil prices from a consumption point of view
5248844 the nature of your call on prospective rate cuts is going to be subject to the forecast risk that is really enveloping oil and food prices
5248845 the powerful point that the governor of the central bank tito mboweni made was that if you continue to see prevailing oil prices sustained and there is some degree of stability in the food market then inflation is likely to unfold with a decelerating bias from the first quarter of 2009
5248846 the bottom line is if inflation does unfold the way the market is thinking and the way the reserve bank is guided in terms of its forecast then under those circumstances which is the kind of mainstream scenario i have to admit late in the first quarter early in the second we will begin to see an easing in monetary policy but that is exactly that it is the mainstream scenario
5248847 we would be wrong if something happened in terms of global military affairs and if oil prices were to suddenly soar back to 150 a barrel and if for example there was perhaps inclement weather in a key food producing region australia or the mid west of the us and you have a sustained surge in oil prices then under those conditions clearly the forecasts that we have got and they alluded to in their statement would be challenged
5248848 if the risk were to materialise immediately then the reserve bank may be worried about inflation expectations

5248854 whether the springboks won or lost wed still go into the game with a bit of confidence we have a lot of confidence within our group and amongst the players that weve got here
5248855 it doesnt matter which side were playing against or the results that have happened previously
5248856 we know this game against the springboks is going to be tough were not taking it lightly but within our squad we are confident in our own abilities
5248857 definitely they will be fired up theyll be looking to get a win at home and obviously there is a bit of pressure on them
5248858 its going to be a much harder game then what weve faced in the past as much as the game in perth was very intense and physical i just think this game is going to be another step up

5249115 meu resultado foi regular n o era o que eu buscava para o primeiro tiro foi s para classificar mesmo
5249116 fiz uma boa largada s que flutuei muito em cima da barreira esta uma prova de ritmo errando na primeira provavelmente erra se nas 10 ou seja a gente multiplica o tempo perdido com o erro por dez
5249117 antes de chegar em pequim vinha obtendo marcas melhores que as de hoje se repetir d para chegar na final

5249123 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5249124 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5249125 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5249126 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5249127 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5249128 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5249129 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5249130 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5249131 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5249132 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5249133 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5249134 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5249135 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5249136 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5249137 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5249138 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5249139 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5249140 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5249141 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

5249156 the implements of execution are available to everyone at virtually no cost
5249157 executions are community projects not with spectators who watch a professional executioner do his duty but rather with actual participants
5249158 by far the most important reason is that stoning is literally a means of crushing the murderers head by means of a rock which is symbolic of god this is analogous to the crushing of the head of the serpent in genesis 3 15 this symbolism testifies to the final victory of god over all the hosts of satan

5249206 neighborhoods are becoming more and more a part of interactive search applications where location granularity matters
5249207 our relationship with skyhook wireless opens up a new ecosystem of interactive applications where location information is equal to social context
5249208 the integration of neighborhood boundary data from urban mapping into skyhooks positioning information will result in more neighborhood relevant information as part of the skyhook wireless loki service and myloki application for facebook and other social networking sites
5249209 additionally the urban mapping neighborhood data adds a richness and more context to social connections than just a city level message or plot on a map for example when our myloki service messages out that a user has changed locations we can say that the user has just checked into back bay in boston instead of just indicating that the user is in boston mass
5249210 with urban mappings robust database of neighborhood boundary data skyhook wireless can offer developers contextually relevant geocoding for the creation of location rich and enabling interactive applications
5249211 as a result were more able to meet an increasing marketplace demand for location accuracy and granularity thats driving the development of much deeper location rich interactive applications

5249275 the two races differ strongly in many qualities which have their roots deep down in the characters of the two nations firstly the tibetans are deeply religious the tibetan government is truthful it can be slow obstinate and secretive in dealing with foreigners but it has a strong regard for truth but the chinese authorities from time to time made statements which were deliberately untrue the chinese are far more cruel than the tibetans are when they tried to conquer areas in tibet they used to put to death what prisoners of war they captured although the only offence of these was fighting in defence of their homeland the tibetans when they captured chinese prisoners of war used simply to send them back to china the chinese treat the granting of a favour merely as a step towards asking for another the tibetans do not treat favours in this way they have a national memory of things for which they are grateful many other examples of the differences dividing these two nations could be given for instance the status of women in tibet is higher than china the kinder treatment of animals and the more orderly government
5249276 a mans wealth was first and foremost measured through the number of sons he had
5249277 it was a matter of survival strong hardy sons were needed in every family to work and to fight bandits and settle feuds
5249278 a survey made in 1940 in eastern tibet came to a somewhat different conclusion it found that 38 percent of the households never got any tea but either collected herbs that grew wild or drank white tea boiled water it found that 51 percent could not afford to use butter and that 75 percent of the households were forced at times to resort to eating grass cooked with cow bones and mixed with oat or pea flower
5249279 there is no method of torture known that is not practised in here on these tibetans slicing boiling tearing asunder and all to sum up what china is doing here in eastern tibet the main things are collecting taxes robbing oppressing confiscating and allowing her representatives to burn and loot and steal
5249280 is credited with having introduced into tibet the use of butter tea cheese barley beer medical knowledge and astrology
5249281 all researchers reach a point of diminishing returns where to continue without publishing only postpones the inevitable
5249282 chinese tibetan and nepali sources are not very plentiful on the whole and not readily accessible even if one has the necessary language skills
5249283 who on the face of it had neither the qualification nor any business to write on india
5249284 we in india are accustomed to interested publication patronized patronized is accepted as an elegant synonym for subsidized by the government i hope miss mayo will not take offence if she comes under the shadow of such suspicion
5249285 they used to write that everything in china was wrong now they write that everything in china is right
5249286 this must surely rank as one of the wonders of the global village beijings master image makers giving lessons in balance and objectivity to american journalists
5249287 tibetan historian tom grunfeld a longtime friend and fellow ccas committee of concerned asian scholars activist from the 1970s with good access to senior chinese officials responsible for the territory was allowed to visit lhasa where he lobbied on our behalf two months later we were thrilled to receive a telex from the lhasa waiban inviting cnn to tibet
5249288 a decade earlier mutual aid teams were formed then agricultural cooperatives and finally in 1965 66 peoples communes mechanization has begun and experimental agricultural stations have developed more resilient higher yield grains as well as strains of tobacco tea sugar beets and a dozen vegetables which can grow readily in the climate of the roof of the world innovations such as insecticides chemical fertilizers irrigation and veterinary medicine have been introduced into a land that hardly even know of their existence in short the lot of the tibetan people has improved immeasurably
5249289 there were between three to four thousand villages and towns each having between three to four thousand families with four to five thousand people from each town and village about 800 to 1 000 people were imprisoned out of this at least 300 to 400 people of them died in prison
5249290 if there was a film made on all the atrocities perpetrated in qinghai province it would shock the viewers in golok area many people were killed and their dead bodies were rolled down the hill into a big ditch the soldiers told the family members and relatives of the dead people that they should all celebrate since the rebels had been wiped out they were even forced to dance on the dead bodies soon after they were also massacred with machine guns they were all buried there
5249291 can you hold an international track meet when you got a labor camp right down the street can you sponsor the olympics in 08 when you still imprison people for their faith
5249292 the people of the world must tell the chinese communist regime in no uncertain terms that not only do we strongly disagree we will not give consent to these atrocities by remaining silent as they happen
5249293 in the run up to the olympics the chinese authorities have locked up put under house arrest and forcibly removed individuals they believe may threaten the image of stability and harmony they want to present to the world
5249294 the olympic spirit hangs its head in shame when police states are allowed to host the games like germany when hitler reigned supreme seeking glory for his murderous regime
5249295 just on my part i had to create an atmosphere youve got to draw people into it its hard these days cause people listen to the beat first it was originally a folk song so people might not pay attention to it
5249296 i also worked with courtney a lot on the lyrics and how to express it what should be strong the instrumentation i just wanted to keep simple and sparse a guitar strum organ drums its got that mood to it more melancholy
5249297 its what youd call urban folk i really have a respect for artists like bob dylan and i would definitely put randall efner in that category that level of song writing and conviction he doesnt back down from the subject at hand i am honored that he allowed me to record his song
5249298 i am pleased that we are able to make a net profit in the most difficult business environment in the airline industrys history but the industry outlook is still very grim
5249299 its a very difficult business environment to achieve these full year profit targets but we will give it our very best shot

5249309 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5249310 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5249311 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5249312 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5249313 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5249320 broadband on the move is bringing about a change in consumer behaviour the days of the internet being something for the home are over
5249321 retailers should take advantage of the fact that customers may now have access to the internet whilst in store and for example use their wifi connections to deliver expert advice via a store intranet channel
5249322 people want fit for purpose content that offers as sophisticated an experience on their handheld device as theyre used to on their pc

5249390 die menschen in dem festzelt wurden von dem angriff und dieser brutalit t v llig berrascht
5249391 es gibt sehr viele zeugen die wir einzeln vernehmen werden die ermittlungen laufen auf hochtouren

5249394 we could have sold more but the stadium capacity 35 525 limited us
5249395 we also wanted people from the whole country to be able to come and find one off tickets to support us
5249396 there are 15 people all with the same substance this is the strangest thing because it leads to the conclusion that there is an organized effort
5249397 there is an organized crime because that is what this is called
5249398 because it seems there is a lot of money hidden there a lot of profit
5249399 i am neither a policeman nor a detective nor a judge i dont have that knowledge and i think that the time has come for the state to do something and find a solution i believe that if they want to they will find it and i believe they do want to
5249400 whoever does such things gets mixed up in such things commits suicide and when someone wants to commit suicide nobody can stop them
5249401 of course it has to be organized when there are so many cases with the same substance
5249402 supplied to the naive because someone who knows that this could lead them to death doesnt try it
5249403 as for fani it is a fact that they went after her i love fani very much it was wrong for her to allow those who fought her to be vindicated

5249408 its going to be difficult change is always tough and electing me is change it means that people are going to hesitate a little bit ba rack o bama theyre still getting past that name but its a testament to the american spirit that im even standing before you as the democratic nominee
5249409 democrats because weve burned in the last few elections get nervous and skittish right around this time
5249410 they say oh no here the republicans come theyre so mean and theyre going to be doing all these things
5249411 there could be some supply disruption issues there so the market is watching this closely
5249412 the market will probably get through this hurricane news pretty quickly
5249413 the number one story in global assets is for now the rise of the dollar index
5249414 since it was a key market input for the upward move of crude oil any further rise in the dollar index should further limit the upside potential for oil

5249484 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
5249485 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
5249486 in the decade up to 2006 residential property prices in ireland rose more rapidly than in any other developed economy strong demand partly explains this incomes employment and population all grew robustly the increase in the supply of new housing was just as phenomenal the number of annual housing completions in 2006 was almost five times that of the early 1990s which compares with static output in the euro area and in the uk however when supply and demand fundamentals are considered in tandem the enormous increase in prices was unjustified consequently the countrys property market is now going sharply into reverse prices have been falling for 18 months and excess supply makes further declines all but inevitable in the event of an even sharper correction than is currently predicted the main lenders would probably suffer badly although irelands banks have been highly profitable over a long period and are thus well capitalised they are hugely exposed to the domestic property market the international credit crisis should it continue could cause serious financing problems for the banks adding to concerns about their balance sheets
5249487 the outlook for household spending growth in northern ireland is looking more subdued now than at any time since the early 1990s
5249488 it took more than thirty hours of struggle with sending and resending to transmit buchanans equally brief telegram back to the queen
5249489 it reflected the engineering influence of william thomson instead of edward whitehouse and it would not fail the way the whitehouse cable had
5249490 an emergency meeting has taken place at stormont between ministers and relevant agencies in the aftermath of saturdays flooding
5249491 those affected could expect to receive around 1 000 in compensation but the figure has yet to be finalised councils will be notified of the scheme on monday so that people will be able to make applications
5249492 the relevant agencies met on friday after receiving weather warnings as a result northern ireland water was able to deploy resources and contractors throughout the event and around the clock
5249493 willing to negotiate if the terms on offer meet his partys requirements
5249494 this executive is incompetent its time they got with doing the job that they were set up to do its a very definite and a very emphatic no
5249495 martin the police did not plant the bomb your former associates did
5249496 he wanted to come round to the house to pay his respects but i didnt want that and we met in the hotel since then we have communicated intermittently over the years and i did meet him with gerry adams and gerry kelly but that meeting was not a terribly good one
5249497 nothing came of it and i was very disappointed by the response from adams in particular on friday i decided to send a text to martin mcguinness to again ask him to give that vital assistance and urge his fellow republicans to give the information that would convict the bombers but again he wouldnt agree to that but when sinn fein does take that step it will show that they are genuinely into peace and a system of justice which should protect everybody catholic and protestant
5249498 it would be very hard not to improve any of the london airports wed staff security queues properly and passport controls which are a joke at the moment we have people being delayed one or two hours just to get back into their own country
5249499 this is the new biometric scanner but you havent told me about it
5249500 they put the protection of the killers above the attainment of justice
5249501 the very serious concerns about how the police handled this investigation from beginning to end
5249502 that is why my position is to support the calls that are made by families here for the establishment of an independent tribunal
5249503 they obviously have lost all faith and we have seen debacle after debacle in terms of the investigation of this terrible atrocity what we need to do is support the families in the demands they now make
5249504 one of the things that surprised me because i grew up in england was that people here northern ireland protestants and i only learned this fairly recently protestants would have been taught as children that they could not trust catholics i found that astonishing but when i explored it with protestant friends they all agreed that was the case
5249505 i could never understand why it mattered that i was a catholic police ombudsman it baffled me but eventually i was told this was the teaching of some churches to their people and that meant i could understand a lot of what has been said about me

5249510 we continue to hold the view that impairment charges are likely to be significantly higher over the next two years and therefore are comfortable with a sell rating
5249511 after viewing the situation and consulting legal advisers and poltical allies with their advice i have decided to resign
5249512 what are they doing where are they going whats happening i dont get it any more they lost me
5249513 i still appreciate what theyre doing or what theyre trying to do but i think theyre trying too hard not to be radiohead that seems a little ridiculous to me
5249514 i like them as a rock band all the buttons and sequencing and stuff like that i dont really care for im a fan of rock music and what theyre doing now i dont think is very good
5249515 sting sting would be another person whos a hero the music hes created over the years i dont really listen to it but the fact that hes making it i respect that i care desperately about what i do do i know what product im selling no do i know what im doing today no but im here and im gonna give it my best shot
5249516 yeah we are just the family no one else not anna not caolan and not jordan

5249518 if it be so our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the furnace of blazing fire and he will deliver us out of your hand o king but even if he does not let it be known to you o king that we are not going to serve your gods or worship the golden image you have set up
5249519 god you can heal her and make her whole but even if you do not i will still serve you
5249520 i cant believe it the justice system is a complete shambles
5249521 i continue to get regular complaints about cycles being ridden on footpaths and without lights at night and the campaign will try to address these concerns
5249522 riding in this manner causes a danger and inconvenience to pedestrians and to other road users in addition to the hazard posed to the cyclists themselves
5249523 many of the main routes in felixstowe have cycle lanes and even these are not being used
5249524 during our last campaign a significant number of fixed penalty notices were issued which resulted in a noticeable decline in the number of persons flouting the law suffolk homes

5249526 this is a call to the global community that it is possible to increase pediatric cancer survival even in countries that have high under 5 mortality rates for other causes such as infectious diseases
5249527 with a modest financial investment we can improve survival very quickly
5249528 that is because these countries have developed twinning programs with st jude and other institutions
5249529 the data show a modest investment in health if it is well organized can produce an incredible increase in pediatric cancer survival
5249530 countries with limited resources should not be afraid to tackle pediatric cancer as a national health priority because they can have decent programs if they make a relatively small investment
5249531 and that investment can come from outside sources as well

5249552 canadians whose monthly housing expenses exceed a maximum gds ratio of 32 per cent risk overextending themselves and could face challenges in meeting their mortgage obligations while those who underestimate housing costs may be taken aback by the reality of rising housing costs in canada
5249553 its important that homebuyers properly evaluate their current financial situation and seek proper guidance about what they can truly afford
5249554 online tools such as mortgage calculators are a good starting point for homebuyers to determine appropriate housing budgets but they shouldnt stop there
5249555 a one on one consultation with a mortgage professional will help borrowers define a plan that ties home ownership dreams to personal and financial goals
5249556 make sure you have your income taxes up to date or you might not be even be able to get a mortgage
5249557 also get recent pay stubs for perhaps two months an employment letter or notice of assessments for the two previous tax years as proof of income and ensure all your bills are paid up since they could reflect on your credit rating
5249558 when working out the details of the mortgage ensure this option exists and is clearly defined
5249559 by pre paying your mortgage you can greatly reduce the life of the mortgage and therefore reduce the amount of interest you pay
5249560 were not only dealing with hardened criminals were dealing with desperate people
5249561 when the economics are dismal people are doing things that perhaps they thought they would never do
5249562 based on 35 years experience yes i anticipate there will be an escalation
5249563 we have been collecting statistics for over 25 years and there has never been a development in the economy that has shown a clear impact on arson
5249564 i have heard of builders torching incomplete homes that cant be sold
5249565 these are not necessarily lower middle class people this is all over the place were talking some extremely wealthy individuals based on the size of the home and the contents of the home people who were living some lavish lifestyles who no longer can afford that
5249566 these people are so upset they got tricked into getting these mortgages and they never could afford them
5249567 are insurers ready for the potential increase in arsons are fire investigators on alert
5249568 they did a pretty comprehensive look at it its still no its maybe one that the coppers and the investigative guys maybe its just fun for them to talk about it
5249569 traditionally there will be some acts of fraud that are driven by the economic conditions no question about it
5249570 there were arsons in the middle of a flooded city if you can believe it
5249571 but the industry as you can understand was reluctant to call attention to it we were more focused on dealing with people who were displaced
5249572 we are finding there have been a lot of greedy people mortgaged to the hilt
5249573 a lot of people dont realize the extent to which insurance companies investigate these
5249574 oh yeah insurance companies will just pay out this money they wont conduct any investigation are in for a surprise

5249586 effector t cells mediate immune responses like accelerators make cars go forward while a specialized population called regulatory t cells stop an immune response like brakes slow down a car
5249587 regulatory t cells actively suppress the activation of effector t cells that are reactive and damaging to self tissues thereby preventing autoimmune disease
5249588 in the context of an infection after the effector t cell has orchestrated the correct immune response and the pathogen is gone regulatory t cells can help calm down the immune system
5249589 in contrast there are very few that issue stop signals only two or three so il 35 is special
5249590 this discovery adds significantly to our understanding of how these cells prevent immune responses from running out of control and causing damage
5249591 to return to the car analogy il 35 may turn out to be a very important brake for the immune system
5249592 there is mounting evidence that regulatory t cells stop our ability to eradicate tumors
5249593 tumors produce a dilemma within the immune system on one hand the system wants to get rid of the tumor cells but on the other hand theyre a part of us thus regulatory t cells may prevent the immune system from attacking the tumor experimental studies have shown that if you can remove regulatory t cells or dampen their activity then tumor immunity becomes vigorous and the body can get rid of the tumor
5249594 regulatory t cells are seen as a major impediment to the development of effective anti cancer vaccines and may prevent sterilizing immunity in certain chronic infections such as hepatitis c and tuberculosis
5249595 blocking the activity of il 35 may reduce the function of regulatory t cells and their ability to block anti tumor immune responses so treatments that block il 35 activity may make anti cancer vaccines more effective
5249596 when i interviewed with dario he said the best thing about st jude is that your only limitation is your imagination and he was right
5249597 one of the best things about science is the fact that your discovery attracts the interest of other bright minds other scientists will hear about il 35 and say maybe this new protein is important in the disease process or condition that im studying by collaborating with others whose expertise is different than ours we can hasten progress
5249598 i believe this protein has a good chance of having therapeutic applications
5249599 im a st jude donor myself and like other donors i think its important to remember that at the end of the day the goal of our research is to treat patients especially the children we have here at st jude
5249600 autophagy is a cell survival jack of all trades and were trying to understand the signals that trigger its onset
5249601 this process developed so early in the evolution of life that at least some types of microorganisms must have learned how to avoid this defensive response of the cell to being invaded we want to know how invading microorganisms avoid being destroyed by autophagy and learn how cancer cells use autophagy to resist chemotherapy drugs before they have a chance to work
5249602 we suspected that because tlr signaling triggers both phagocytosis and autophagy that this signal might also link these activities together as well as enable each process to occur separately
5249603 this would make sense since autophagy kills microorganisms that invade the cell and phagocytosis deliberately brings microorganisms into the cell to destroy them so having two totally separate and unrelated sets of signals to do a similar job would be like re inventing the biochemical wheel
5249604 this strongly suggested that tlr recruits parts of the autophagy machinery to enable the phagosome to fully develop and fuse with the lysosome even if autophagy itself doesnt occur simultaneously
5249605 we can actually see phagocytosis take place in live cells and we can study it in detail so we know the steps involved
5249606 but autophagy seems to occur suddenly and we know about it only after its very obviously underway now that we discovered that phagocytosis uses some of the same biochemical signals as autophagy does we can use that information to solve the mystery of how autophagy works we hope that we will be able to translate that new knowledge in the future into improved treatments for infections and cancer
5249607 we think we have identified a pathway that can be used to prevent tumor formation and a potential target for therapy
5249608 we were interested in whether there were signals that inhibited tumor formation
5249609 and if there were which ones were they could they be used to identify new therapeutic targets
5249610 what was not known and what we now find is that the effect of bmps on normal gnp cells is almost exactly mimicked in gnp like tumor cells
5249611 what we a found is that using a lower dose of the sonic hedgehog inhibitor in combination with bmp gives the same therapeutic effect as high doses of the hedgehog inhibitor
5249612 we hope that by reducing the levels of both compounds we might prevent the secondary effects on bone of this potential therapy
5249613 i say let me go and search for some food

5249625 the taliban use tactics in which they cause civilian life to be at risk they the taliban have no regard for the afghan people and support for the taliban in helmand is reducing

5249663 these findings emphasize that patients with aml especially those with high white blood cell count should be treated in an experienced tertiary center with a good supportive care team
5249664 for example at st jude we have a dedicated team of clinicians taking care of aml patients and they are more aware of the need to treat hyperleukocytosis are more experienced and are more vigilant in patient care than is usually found at a less specialized hospital
5249665 even though we had dramatically reduced early deaths in this group of patients in the latter period of the study the long term result for patients with these complications was still not good
5249666 we have continued to address their problems with new treatment approaches and have now improved not only the early results but also their long term outcome

5249681 among the many mysteries surrounding autoimmune diseases is why they can sometimes take decades to manifest themselves
5249682 our findings hint that this delayed onset could be explained by subtle defects in the molecular controls on t cells
5249683 the itams we studied are little molecular tags inside the cell by which the t cell receptor communicates to the rest of the cell
5249684 the mystery we wanted to address was why the t cell receptor needs 10 itams to do its job why not just have a simple on off switch
5249685 we theorized that there were two possibilities why the immune system needs so many itams
5249686 one is that the requirement was purely quantitative and that the itams were there for signal amplification the second possibility is that different itams do slightly different things they do have slightly different structures so maybe they bind to some signaling molecules better than others and their positions in the t cell receptor are different so while our primary observation is that quantity is more important than itam type we also found that type has some influence
5249687 one implication of our findings is that a relatively small defect in the efficiency of signal transduction through the t cell receptor could give rise to a subtle failing in negative selection which gives rise over a long period of time to a few overly active t cells that might initiate autoimmunity
5249688 clearly from our studies there is the possibility that you dont really need a very big reduction in t cell receptor signal strength to have a defect in negative selection
5249689 we were surprised to find that many itams were required to make t cells divide and expand but only one or two was required to make t cells secrete cytokines
5249690 we believe this idea that t cell signaling acts more like a rheostat than an on off switch offers significant new insights into how t cell development and function is controlled
5249691 a major issue we face in managing patients with recurrent sarcomas is the paucity of active agents
5249692 there is a limited number of drugs that are active against bone sarcomas and these are usually used as front line treatments when the sarcomas recur we have essentially no active agents
5249693 we were first very careful to see whether we would see any excess toxicity in children compared to that seen in adults
5249694 when we found that the combination was well tolerated we used it in more patients since our colleagues at rady childrens hospital were also using it for refractory sarcoma we decided to pool our data

5249705 sono diventato il numero 1 provo un sentimento di grande felicita dice ancora il tennista spagnolo che ormai tra i suoi tifosi puo vantare anche un certo michael phelps ma questo sentimento non e diverso rispetto agli ultimi anni durante i quali credo proprio di aver giocato molto bene

5249711 india will not interfere in pakistans affairs relationship with pakistan is not individual specific
5249712 i do hope politics in pakistan will be settled soon
5249713 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf of pakistan this is an internal matter of pakistan
5249714 whether he is impeached or not is not important from the indian point of view it is for the people of pakistan to decide
5249715 but it leaves a big vacuum and we are deeply concerned about this vacuum because it leaves the radical extremist outfits with freedom to do what they like not merely on the pakistan afghan border but clearly our side of the border too
5249716 maybe an hour of my neighbors time to give up which i think is fair to ask consdiering i kept her three children ages 2 6 and 8 for two hours 3pm to 5 30pm

5249750 this mantra of elections is replete with red herrings craftily synthesized to maintain pakistan as a servile client state in order to carry on with the same bold imperial designs on the grand chessboard it is merely the rebottling of the same old wine in a different bottle it will surely be legitimately conducted with no apparent riggings and duly approved by all the impartial international observers to give the artful elections an official international legitimacy it is quite immaterial who wins in these elections the laws and the judiciary of the nation have already been reconstituted under the umbrella of emergency to enable the nation to carry on unfettered in its primary objective of fighting the war on terror as an obedient patsy client state and hence to carry on in its own devilishly crafted suicide

5249754 we dont have guns we dont have banks we dont have storm troopers and we dont have a powerful media what we have is our convictions our courage and our potential weve done a lot of research and weve done a lot of talking and writing what we have not done is taken the next step toward calculated revolution a revolution always begins with ideas and ideals these power the willing and cause the ranks to swell sometimes often the revolution becomes subverted and when the tables are turned the same people are still sitting there this is simplistic but most of you have a grasp of the minutiae and some sense of history real history

5249759 our findings show that children under 3 years with dpg can potentially respond better to treatment than older children
5249760 unlike other previous studies in young children where the diagnosis of dpg was based on either ct scans or magnetic resonance imaging mri the diagnosis of all our patients was based on mri only ct scans are not able to differentiate between dpg a tumor that occurs in the brainstem and other tumors which originate in the same area with a better prognosis
5249761 we believe that the more we learn about dpgs the more likely we will be able to design more effective treatments for children of all ages with this tumor
5249762 dat belgi nog geen medaille heeft kunnen behalen op deze spelen wakkert de verwachtingen naar ons toe natuurlijk nog aan
5249763 wij fixeren ons echter niet op het brons we gaan eerst en vooral voor een finale en daarin proberen we dan een belgisch record te lopen als we daarin slagen is een mooie plaats niet veraf
5249764 het heeft daarom ook niet veel zin om de andere landen te analyseren
5249765 de concurrentie is net het enige wat we niet onder controle hebben als we naar de anderen zouden kijken zou dat alles nog veel vermoeiender maken
5249766 we hebben gezien dat onze aflossingen op de laatste trainingen heel goed waren alle kleine problemen zijn onder controle en we zijn allemaal in vorm dus we zijn er helemaal klaar voor
5249767 het is zo goed als opgelost dus ik zal 200 kunnen voluit gaan
5249768 ik wil de beste wedstrijd van mijn leven zwemmen mijn trainingstijden zijn heel goed ik zwem nu na 8 km dezelfde tijden als tijdens wedstrijden op de 1500m twee jaar geleden dat toont aan dat ik in topvorm zit en mentaal zorgt dat voor rust ik denk dat ik een kans maak er zijn er misschien twee die te sterk zijn maar daarna zijn we met een tiental die zullen strijden voor het podium ik ben weliswaar de jongste maar ik ben hier zeker niet om te leren ik heb tegen iedereen al gezwommen en ik wil donderdag gewoonweg presteren
5249769 de omstandigheden zijn niet ideaal met heel warm water en veel algen maar ze zijn wel voor iedereen hetzelfde
5249770 de race wordt echter toch anders omdat er maar 25 starters zijn tegenover 50 70 in andere wedstrijden dat maakt de kans op een ontsnapping groter dus ik zal in de eerste 7 5 km moeten opletten en niet te veel achteraan zwemmen normaal zwem ik veel achteraan en zorg ik dat ik na driekwart wedstrijd vooraan zit
5249771 we zijn heel blij met deze samenwerking ook gevangenen hebben recht op cultuur en ontspanning
5249772 al laten we nummers zoals keep on rocking in the free world misschien maar beter achterwege
5249773 we hebben zo breed mogelijk geprogrammeerd en hopen opnieuw 130 000 bezoekers te lokken
5249774 natuurlijk wilden we graag bij de top drie eindigen maar de realiteit gebiedt me te zeggen dat onze vierde plaats momenteel toch dichter bij de realiteit aanleunt kevin en bob lootten hier immers meteen de regerende wereldkampioenen colin carr frankrijk en de regerende europese kampioenen knuudsen poulsen op de koop toe zorgt het vernieuwde duitse team hollstein ihle voor de stunt door deze twee toppers zomaar vlot te verslaan
5249775 maesen en de bont moesten dus wel op een maximaal toerental draaien om zich tussen die top drie te wringen en dat deden ze duidelijk niet mij verwondert dit niet echt want op duisburg na hebben bob en kevin nog geen echte toprace gevaren dit seizoen zij missen duidelijk wat wedstrijdritme en agressiviteit net daarom vind ik het helemaal geen ramp dat ze woensdag een extra wedstrijd moeten peddelen het geeft ons de kans om nog wat bij te sturen
5249776 uiteraard zijn ze daarin helemaal niet kansloos met een tweede snelste tijd van de zeven boten die in hun halve finalerace starten moet finishen bij de top drie en dus doorstoten tot de olympische finale best haalbaar zijn
5249777 mijn lies is soms wat gevoelig en de 100m en het verspringen zullen daardoor wat lastig zijn maar ik zie het zitten door mijn blessure had mijn voorbereiding beter gekund maar op training ben ik beter dan vorig jaar ik hoop dan ook beter te doen dan toen maar het wordt moeilijker dan op het wk om in de top 12 te eindigen ik verwacht een heel hoog niveau met waarschijnlijk ook een wereldrecord voor de amerikaan brian clay maar in tienkamp kan er voor iedereen altijd iets misgaan
5249778 daar zou ik heel tevreden mee zijn maar het is heel moeilijk te voorspellen ik denk dat het puntenaantal voor de top 12 ergens rond het belgisch record zal liggen op papier ben ik 17e van alle deelnemers maar ik wil zeker hoger eindigen
5249779 either enter jordan without religious objects or go back to israel
5249780 they seemed to know exactly what they were looking for
5249781 it was very demeaning to have such a negative experience in what is billed as a friendly country people in the group including the tour guides were quite shocked no one had ever heard that jordan imposed religious restrictions
5249782 what made it worse was that the whole thing seemed to be directed solely at jews i saw christians walking through into jordan openly wearing crosses apparently christian religious symbols did not seem to be a problem for the jordanians i can well imagine the international outcry if islamic tourists were to encounter such restrictions on their entry into israel
5249783 the jordanian security authorities are responsible for the safety of all visitors to the kingdom and it is our duty to take all measures required in this regard
5249784 the vast majority of the group decided that as proud israelis we were either going to be allowed to walk into jordan holding our religious objects or we would not go in at all
5249785 and when i spoke in june at the aam conference about blogs a number of attendees said their firms internet security wont let them access blogs from the office

5249790 the discovery is important because it explains why patients with sialidosis have enlarged spleens and suggests that new drugs or gene therapies that target that problem might be an effective therapy
5249791 the results also explain how the loss of neu1 can cause bone marrow transplantations to fail and therefore suggests that such failures might also be corrected by target therapeutics
5249792 our work represents an unexpected and important clue to one of the prominent clinical manifestations of sialidosis patients
5249793 we were surprised to discover that an old ubiquitous enzyme in lysosomes better known for digesting cellular waste products plays such an important role in a basic biological process that when exacerbated contributes to the outcome of such a terrible disease in children
5249794 the evidence strongly suggests that in children lacking a normal gene for neu1 disruption of the bone marrow environment causes the exodus of hematopoietic cells from the marrow to the spleen
5249795 that leads to development of the symptoms of sialidosis although we dont have a cure for this terrible disease we are now beginning to identify alternative ways to improve the disease outcome in affected children
5249796 the exciting thing about this work is that it sheds light on two major issues the cause of sialidosis and the reason for bone marrow transplantation failure in the absence of neu1
5249797 this wealth of new information gives us a better understanding of the physiological function of neu1 which appears to be much broader than originally thought this illustrates the important role of basic research in making discoveries that have major implications for medical problems
5249798 the discovery is important because it explains why patients with sialidosis have enlarged spleens and suggests that new drugs or gene therapies that target that problem might be an effective therapy

5249808 on another note i like to take this opportunity to thank you for chosing to help children with special needs whether or not the programme is successful i appreciate your efforts in this raising a special needs boy is really a tremendous challenging task for parents accepting them into the school community and regarding them as a is already something i am grateful for my child is i know you have been tasked to help dyslexic boys and your hands are also full but if it is still possible i hope you can help in a little way many times we asked for greater understanding among teachers and staff like yourself so that our special needs children are not misunderstood it is thru no fault of theirs that they are in their present medical condition they did not chose to be one
5249809 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs
5249810 its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
5249811 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives

5249819 target presents varietys power of youth campaign is a powerful one one that harnesses the energy of more than 150 young performers who are in a position to influence their peers and fans with the support of target and our other sponsors the power of youth effort has the opportunity to generate millions of dollars to benefit st jude childrens research hospital and create a bedrock of social awareness within the next generation of entertainment
5249820 our partnership educates and encourages young individuals to take action in their community
5249821 this event is important to target because of our long standing relationship with st jude childrens research hospital and the meaningful work they do

5249831 i assume they think the kids were very natural looking and nice
5249832 chinese people have the right to be proud to be chinese why cant tibetan people have the right to be tibetan it is our country it was invaded by china
5249833 the chinese people deserve to hear the truth about what is happening in tibet the tibetan people are undergoing psychological torture
5249834 what i saw is the security guards were very rude to the reporters they pushed them i heard orders being shouted by the officers just use your hands they said get to the reporters and cover their camera lenses as a chinese person i feel bad
5249835 oh look honey i wonder whats behind this lovely picturesque screen
5249836 i feel badly for the athletes who wont get to use my shots but after tibet i know im right

5249847 ive been asked hundreds of times in my life why god allows tragedy and suffering i have to confess that i really do not know the answer totally even to my own satisfaction

5249854 today in line with the plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers has begun
5249855 unfortunately we see no signs that the russians are starting to pull out or even preparing to withdraw from georgia
5249856 there is no real sign of a withdrawal so it is difficult to understand what is going on with the russians
5249857 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces or people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted

5249864 there was absolutely no reason to write to cbk that the public procurement act did not apply since they cbk were not comfortable with my opinion
5249865 the first half in particular was not good enough we know that
5249866 they put us under a lot of pressure and maybe we were a little bit slow to get going
5249867 it was certainly not the best game we have played but the important thing was that we got better in the second half and at the end fernando popped up with a goal and that was enough to win the game
5249868 the most important thing is that we got the win it was good to get three points and keep a clean sheet
5249869 we have to be happy with that but we have to look at what we can do better because there are many many things that we can do better
5249870 thats why im here whenever the manager needs me i will do my best he asked me to do a job against sunderland and hopefully i did that
5249871 we are lucky enough to have so many good defenders at this club so when you play you have to give everything if you want to keep your place

5249901 we have sold players for more than 20million in the summer and he told me if you sell players you can buy with that too
5249902 i have the support of at least one of the owners i sent e mails to all of them but he was clear we had the money
5249903 it is not something that i can explain you have to analyse it but to me it is clear they were supporting me if we had money and we do have money
5249904 i will not talk about any player but in april i was talking about this
5249905 we tried to do things in confidentiality but sometimes you cannot and you need to explain before the end of the transfer window
5249906 if the manager has an idea and it is not a question of money then we have to make the right decisions in terms of whom we bring in that has to be the decision of the manager
5249907 seems pretty easy until you realize she was a very old woman and certainly past the normal childbearing years
5249908 mit der berufung dieses erfahrenen und in der branche anerkannten touristikers unterstreichen wir nicht zuletzt die bedeutung die nach wie vor das gesch ft mit den reiseveranstaltern f r uns hat
5249909 he maintained he had bought them all at the portman road car boot sale on january 6 this year but b amp q did not get them until january 16
5249910 the drills were stolen in the second week of january and very soon after you put them on ebay so you are very close to the source of the person who stole them
5249911 if you so much as put a foot out of line or commit an offence you will be in breach and you will go to prison for 20 weeks
5249912 among the many mysteries surrounding autoimmune diseases is why they can sometimes take decades to manifest themselves
5249913 our findings hint that this delayed onset could be explained by subtle defects in the molecular controls on t cells
5249914 the itams we studied are little molecular tags inside the cell by which the t cell receptor communicates to the rest of the cell
5249915 the mystery we wanted to address was why the t cell receptor needs 10 itams to do its job why not just have a simple on off switch
5249916 we theorized that there were two possibilities why the immune system needs so many itams
5249917 one is that the requirement was purely quantitative and that the itams were there for signal amplification the second possibility is that different itams do slightly different things they do have slightly different structures so maybe they bind to some signaling molecules better than others and their positions in the t cell receptor are different so while our primary observation is that quantity is more important than itam type we also found that type has some influence
5249918 one implication of our findings is that a relatively small defect in the efficiency of signal transduction through the t cell receptor could give rise to a subtle failing in negative selection which gives rise over a long period of time to a few overly active t cells that might initiate autoimmunity
5249919 clearly from our studies there is the possibility that you dont really need a very big reduction in t cell receptor signal strength to have a defect in negative selection
5249920 we were surprised to find that many itams were required to make t cells divide and expand but only one or two was required to make t cells secrete cytokines
5249921 we believe this idea that t cell signaling acts more like a rheostat than an on off switch offers significant new insights into how t cell development and function is controlled
5249922 more than all the farmers in rhode island hawaii alaska new hampshire connecticut massachusetts maine nevada and new jersey combined
5249923 nat rlich sind wir in dieser saison die underdogs aber die k nnen auch bei en und zwar in die wadeln weil wir nicht h her kommen
5249924 wir brauchen wieder spieler die gras fressen und wenn es sein muss rohes
5249925 this one has just crossed the boundary from ape to human
5249926 the person who took the call actually said no i immediately called back and said yes i was damn sure i was going to make it and i did
5249927 i guess now the only person bigger to cook for is the pope
5249928 some t cell receptors are adept at promoting autoimmunity some are poor and some are protective it is not clear why one t cell receptor can promote autoimmunity whereas another t cell receptor on a similar kind of t cell either doesnt do anything or even protects against autoimmune reaction
5249929 this finding of an association between t cell engraftment and spontaneous disease suggested to us that there is some barrier to the development of disease
5249930 why are cells that engraft better more likely to cause disease we really dont know the answer once the mice start to get disease they get very sick but there is sort of a triggering point our findings may suggest that disease triggering in these models involves a mass effect that requires some quantity of specific t cells to ignite disease but we really want to find out whether it is the cell number itself or whether receptor recognition properties that lead to increased engraftment also lead to increased susceptibility to disease these are things we can test
5249931 these findings dont have a direct clinical implication right now but if we understand which t cells induce pathology and why and which cells are protective or passive we will gain a better sense of where to target what are called antigen specific therapies
5249932 those therapies try to selectively target the t cells that cause disease sparing the rest of the immune system
5249933 ik heb best goed gespeeld zes partijen gewonnen twee gelijk gespeeld en n verloren maar dat was wel tegen de uiteindelijke wereldkampioen pim niemeijer uit rotterdam die was gewoon erg goed ach volgend jaar beter
5249934 i have sent my resignation to the presidents secretariat and told them i cant continue performing my duties after the president resigned i didnt think it would be ethically right to continue
5249935 oh i dont think he knew anything ahead of time

5249968 wise and honest before moving on to a litany of political figures on both sides of the aisle
5249969 thats why whether or not they found weapons of mass destruction in iraq is beside the point saddam and his sons were raping the country literally and we morally had to do something
