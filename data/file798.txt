7980008 weve had a lot of republicans in town and after a while you kind of start assimilating and you get a little worried
7980009 so you kind of have to come back here and be with democrats and really kind of talk about issues that matter
7980010 it is not exactly clear where this idea came from because there are no studies showing this to be the case
7980011 new fda regulations and current indian policies do not specify any maximum acceptable concentrations or daily dose limits for metals in dietary supplements for domestic use
7980012 we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing

7980020 the fulfillment of a desire expressed by betancourt herself in bogota after she was freed on july 2
7980021 the holy father met with betancourts mother yolanda pulecio at the vatican and that the pontiffs repeated pleas for the release of all hostages and their return to their families as well as for a new dialogue of reconciliation in colombia are widely known
7980022 consumers really need this information to make choices when hiring a busing company to transport their children
7980023 the relevant courts have issued the release of those whose legal status necessitates release
7980024 the report harshly criticizes both lebanon and syria saying there has been no improvement over the past year despite promises by both countries to address the issue
7980025 these bunkers can hold up to 15 fighters plus rockets and rocket launchers and in the event of war with israel could serve either as missile launching bases or as ambushes for israeli ground troops
7980026 neither the un forces in lebanon nor the lebanese army has done anything to stop construction of these bunkers
7980027 neither syria nor lebanon was doing anything to stop the smuggling
7980028 the equipment is outdated the personnel are poorly trained and the inspections are inadequate to detect smuggling
7980029 there are also several well known unofficial border crossings which is where much of the smuggling occurs and the task force found no impediments to reaching these locations
7980030 domestic workers are dying in lebanon at a rate of more than one per week
7980031 falling from high buildings often while trying to escape their employers
7980032 as certain consulates and embassies of migrants did not share their information
7980033 most deaths resulting from a building fall are failed attempts to escape
7980034 what is clear from the figures is that isolation is driving many of these workers to suicide
7980035 dont call this an embassy we have become a funeral parlor people die natural deaths accidents suicide when they try to run away accidents happen
7980036 police do not always investigate whether the employer mistreated the employee and when they do they limit themselves to general questions and accept the employers testimony without cross checking
7980037 in cases where the domestic worker survives a fall police often interview her without the presence of a translator and generally ignore the motives that led her to escape
7980038 all those involved from the lebanese authorities to the workers embassies to the employment agencies to the employers need to ask themselves what is driving these women to kill themselves or risk their lives trying to escape from high buildings
7980039 its unacceptable to have such a high unnatural death rate and its also preventable
7980040 the lebanese are often defensive when talking about the treatment of domestic workers
7980041 we should move beyond this defensiveness and really think about these high death figures and come up with a strategy to improve
7980042 while police reports usually classify cases where domestic workers fall from balconies as suicide this classification is highly suspect
7980043 by the end of june 2008 gross public debt reached ll67 60 trillion a 5 83 percent increase over the end december 2007 level with net public debt at ll60 909 trillion registering an increase of ll2 072 trillion over the end december 2007 level
7980044 tourism and the tourist sector should constitute a main part of the municipalitys responsibility
7980045 such offices are meant to rehabilitate archaeological sites and employ a competent workforce
7980046 in a bid to promote cooperation among the different municipalities on the local level as a starting point toward further cooperation on the regional and international levels
7980047 is to establish a municipal office for archaeological tourist development in all of the networks cities
7980048 such initiatives will give the town its historic right and will provide supplementary income to improve the conditions of its residents in order for them to invest in this heritage
7980049 after 20 minutes the pilot called nyala airport to say the plane had been hijacked and that he was en route to tripoli in libya
7980050 i think its no secret and ive said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think the settlement activity is helpful to the process
7980051 what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7980052 i believe the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together over this period of time
7980053 so we will continue to press ahead to get agreement so that we know what is in israel and what is in palestine that is ultimately the goal
7980054 initiated 433 new housing units during the period of january to may 2008 compared to just 240 units during the period january to may 2007
7980055 which still continue and which without a doubt are the main obstacle in the political process
7980056 just because we have not yet succeeded does not mean we have failed
7980057 the coming weeks will be decisive for the peace process we are at a crossroads and the efforts and the meetings will continue in order to build on the ideas presented for the first time today
7980058 will continue efforts to reach a historic agreement by the end of the bush administration
7980059 i would like to suggest to my partners not to use it as an excuse and i know they are not using it as an excuse but i understand their frustration sometimes
7980060 there were some small activities but they will not influence the ability to negotiate nor the future borders of the palestinian state
7980061 the lebanese should reach agreement on a defense strategy to defy any israeli attacks and avoid using weapons to achieve internal political goals
7980062 successive campaigns against the premiership and attempts to ignite new strife under the title of the powers of the deputy prime minister
7980063 all officials should get back to the constitution and abide by the taif accord
7980064 the internal security forces and lebanese army should take the necessary measures to arrest perpetrators and refer them to the judiciary
7980065 we call on all the lebanese to stand united in order for lebanon to recover its normal life
7980066 distributing seats according to personal interests does not build a country
7980067 the lebanese are suffering from bad economic and living conditions
7980068 in favor of citizens interests and provide them with a dignified life
7980069 so it offers a parliamentary seat to the sons of the kurdish sect
7980070 let there be no mistake about it we are united
7980071 tonight when hillary clinton speaks she will be an articulate voice for the working men and women the middle class families that have been squeezed and she will make the case as she uniquely can for why barack obama is the right choice for the presidency
7980072 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7980073 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7980074 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7980075 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and me our country will be committed to his cause
7980076 the work will begin anew the hope will rise again and the dream lives on
7980077 you lebanese need minimum of three decades to erase all the hatred that built up between feuding groups through the years
7980078 we played an important role in establishing diplomatic relations between syria and lebanon
7980079 dumt och populistiskt f rslag som nedv rderar l raryrket
7980080 i love consumer rights as long as they buy a black ford
7980081 i was the first to speak about applying reforms to the electoral law but this has nothing to do with approving the law as a first step and adopting the reforms at a later stage
7980082 i fear some parties are trying to tie the electoral law issue to other irrelevant issues such as security concerns
7980083 out of respect for ourselves we should all apologize to the lebanese people for the indecent debates that took place during earlier session that were designed to grant the new government a vote of confidence
7980084 yes all arms must be eliminated except those dedicated to fighting israel
7980085 i would like to address the interior and defense ministries and ask them what needs to be done to end this unacceptable phenomenon
7980086 this is an extremely dangerous issue a parliamentary committee will be formed with the mission of looking into phone tapping
7980087 the activity in our markets has scored 80 percent while discounts have reached 50 percent
7980088 we have also added to this commercial boom some other activities such as the organization of festivals and ceremonies in a number of markets particularly in bekaata and baaklin
7980089 reservations at the chouf hotels ranged between 70 and 90 percent with al meer amin and barouk palace hotels being on top of the list
7980090 life in lebanon will not stop and our will is for lebanon to remain the country of cultural and humanitarian diversity and the land where all civilizations meet
7980091 this years festival has gathered thousands of tourists after the latest security instability has forced us to revoke it in the past two years
7980092 in june and july the reserve received some 8 500 tourists while 3 000 people visited it during the first half of august
7980093 came to inspect the situation here and devise plans that contribute to the implementation of development projects
7980094 we would like to see a lot more safety measures on the road
7980095 it is not acceptable to have it increasing every year
7980096 climate change is a present and global crisis that is directly affecting our ecosystems
7980097 we have to work together as a country before we can work together as a world
7980098 in january the arab league will hold a summit where climate change will be discussed once countries unite under one solution the middle east can involve itself on an international level
7980099 this will be a unique opportunity for our governments to show their seriousness
7980100 hell i work with you and i dont even know what your power is green green is not a power green is a color
7980101 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men
7980102 we believe those to be family members of the targeted militant mullah sadiq he was important for us to target
7980103 military operations lasted several hours during which air strikes were called in
7980104 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some 78 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others
7980105 i have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
7980106 the impact of such operations undermines the trust and confidence of the afghan people in efforts to build a just peaceful and law abiding state
7980107 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians must be stopped
7980108 today we have structure government parliament legal authorities and our national institutions have reached strength our police and army are growing
7980109 the requirement of time as well as painful incidents of civilian casualties compelled the afghan government to demand talks on regulating the presence of international forces in afghanistan
7980110 the japanese national who was captured this morning was freed in a police operation
7980111 we have no information he is freed there is confusion over one person they have arrested who looks japanese
7980112 this is not an easy choice but it is the only way to save the lives of people
7980113 unfortunately they were ignored also by nato and the un
7980114 this contradicts the principle of territorial integrity a principle based on the international law of nations and for this reason it is unacceptable
7980115 we consider that this is a regrettable decision and we reiterate our commitment to the territorial integrity of georgia
7980116 were bewildered at the extreme level of activity of nato naval forces in the black sea which continue to increase their numbers
7980117 i dont think we should really be afraid of isolation i dont think we are in for any freezing of relations if all sides are guided by the interests of their countries
7980118 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7980119 this is a great day in the history of our country and our people
7980120 this decision has no legal force russia will face harsh political consequences from this
7980121 as far as overland transport to afghanistan is concerned we do not plan to touch this
7980122 the position of the leadership of the country is that afghanistan is a shared problem
7980123 even if the head of the junta linked by blood and membership of the same tribal group the muslim faith disqualifies him from leading the muslim nation because he is comparable to an infidel
7980124 i am optimistic i have a feeling that the meeting will continue with the general and that we will meet again
7980125 using the territory of mauritania to lead terrorist acts against a foreign country
7980126 i have asked the chief of staff of the army to prepare some proposals for me
7980127 not for conducting military operations as such but to improve intelligence to help our troops better understand the environment they find themselves in
7980128 the young man had spent about five weeks in hastings and was due to return home next weekend his death is incredibly sad
7980129 enormous numbers of foreign students come to hastings and rother each summer in the region of 30 000 to 50 000 the problems and issues they are involved in are very few in comparison to these large numbers
7980130 notwithstanding this no matter how rare an incident like this is the effect on the young mans family can only be imagined
7980131 i saw the english boys attack the arab boys in the street i have been told that they punched him he fell down then they kicked him in the head
7980132 it appears that it could be dealt with during the september session of parliament
7980133 several times a week for the past month until he was confronted about the unauthorized contacts
7980134 can i ask what sort of advice and help you are providing
7980135 had to be seen by any serious observer as trying to substitute a western sphere of influence for russian
7980136 i think it was a case of wanting to get georgia engaged before the window of opportunity closed
7980137 are not capable of enforcing the taiwan model in georgia their army in the caucasus is not strong enough to calm down the situation in their own territory i dont think they are ready for any kind of an adventure in somebody elses territory and hopefully they know it
7980138 we have taken this decision after we failed to find any ray of hope and none of the commitments made to us were fulfilled
7980139 we are sad over nawaz sharifs decision we want to move together and solve the problems facing the nation
7980140 we will request for nawaz sharif to return to the government
7980141 i dont anticipate it would have any impact on our joint efforts to combat extremism
7980142 more effort should be put in order to further reduce
7980143 more cooperation in improving the humanitarian situation especially as the holy month of ramadan approaches an important event for muslims
7980144 it seems last night there was a build up of security forces around the camp
7980145 the police force will remain in place until it enters the camp to collect the stockpiled weapons and prevent the rebels from getting inside the camp
7980146 the situation is very bad the people are really suffering
7980147 weve not had any reports of new incidents or new casualties in our clinic at the moment we are trying to re access the camp to get back to our normal work
7980148 the ministry of peace concerns itself with war the ministry of truth with lies the ministry of love with torture and the ministry of plenty with starvation these contradictions are not accidental nor do they result from ordinary hypocrisy they are deliberate exercises in
7980149 these hypocrites who turn a blind eye to mccains dirty past but sure didnt waste a single solitary second
7980150 that night a forest grew is the most commercial and shockingly danceable thing theyve ever recorded
7980151 i dont ever get mad or any of that stuff just because it is what it is ive said it a lot of times if youre expecting all you guys to talk good about me all the time then youre in for a bad feeling i guess a lot
7980152 its just its part of playing quarterback its part of being part of a franchise like this its part of being in this position is getting ridiculed positive talk theres always going to be talk somes good somes bad ive learned that thats part of it for me id rather not always talk about it more than just sometimes its fun just to play the game and go home at night and talk about whats fun at practice

7980162 ian poulters decision to pull out of the final ryder cup qualifying event at gleneagles to remain in america to contest the fedex cup play offs is perplexing it sends conflicting messages one interpretation could be that he already feels confident
7980163 padraig harringtons successful defence of the open capped a riveting and at times tempestuous championship at royal birkdale all the talk in the build up was about the absence of tiger woods through injury and if i am honest he was
7980164 if the spectacle of reality court shows disfavors white male judges then the overrepresentation of women and non white men among these shows reflects not only the demographics of the viewing audience but also the commodification of non whites particularly blacks as sources of entertainment so who plays whom on daytime television today may have more to do with who is watching and what generates more money for corporate media owners than any conscious effort to shape viewers choices or influence viewers perceptions about race and gender in american courtrooms

7980184 my statement before the sec was completely out of character for me i have tried to live my life in a way that showed that hard work and honesty were their own reward
7980185 i have spent days and nights thinking about why i said what i did in front of the sec on may 25 2007

7980187 thats not just cancer related to melanoma or other skin cancers
7980188 people who have suboptimal ability to repair dna damage that the sun can cause are far more likely to get nonmelanoma skin cancer we are hypothesizing that that might also be the link to why there is a greater increased cancer risk in general
7980189 it is not unreasonable to suppose that patients with nonmelanoma especially if diagnosed when the patient is young puts that person in a higher risk category of systemic cancers
7980190 in addition these patients are followed closely for further skin cancers and therefore may have an increased diagnosis of other cancers because they are plugged into the medical system
7980191 people who have had skin cancers should make sure they are up to date on all their screening tests
7980192 they should be up to date on their colonoscopies fecal occult blood and mammograms and pap smears

7980198 its becoming time to give some credit to the in ring efforts of mark henry
7980199 the worst thing about tonight was the rhodes dibiase defeat at the hands of cena
7980200 edge vs undertaker is the current match of the year and i dont get how anybody can say otherwise
7980201 was it just me or was cenas application of the stfu really sloppy and unbelievable
7980202 im so tired of reading rave reviews for edge who has rapidly become not just the most overrated
7980203 the angle styles match was fine until the overwrought overbooked finish
7980204 jericho being thrown into a match with kane for no reason halts the momentum from the months of great character building
7980205 when has the wwe ever made jericho look good for more than one minute before digging his grave the next
7980206 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
7980207 how can some aspects of the show be so consistently brilliant and other aspects be completely terrible
7980208 this shawn michaels chris jericho feud is borderline unwatchable i get it they hate each other just fight already

7980217 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7980218 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
7980219 speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
7980220 is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
7980221 i dont like that much it really ticks me off
7980222 i think youve got a long list of players that want to play for him ill tell you that hes just incredibly sharp hes a brilliant brilliant basketball mind hes going to bring a system and now you just have to find players to plug into that system
7980223 each time i see chad pennington i am more convinced he is the perfect addition to this team accurate thrower calming influence poised veteran pennington appears in complete control of this offense only a few weeks after joining the dolphins you just know deep down that nothing would make him happier than beating his former jets on opening day
7980224 people always imagine me with perfect hair but thats not who i am
7980225 the first time he saw me in the country my husband found me in wellies covered in mud
7980226 ive been burned by politicians before that i wanted to believe in and just didnt live up to it
7980227 and i was afraid to trust him and i was afraid to have hope when i first kind of became aware of him
7980228 i just said i cant deny how i feel about you barack obama i want you to be the president i want you in the white house i just heard the other day he just paid off his student loans two years ago and so when people talk about financial issues and the higher cost of education he really gets it i think hes the sort of person that inspires us all to be our best selves
7980229 were all out of touch how could we possibly have an awareness of what real americans feel and think and need because we just ride around in limos and i dont know buy diamonds all day long
7980230 im certainly not like that im a passionate american and thats what i am first and foremost
7980231 superman didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to

7980462 as an investor i yearn for a president who looks to financial heroes not corporate lobbyists for economic advice as a gay man i yearn for a president who believes in equal rights for all americans but most of all as an american i yearn for a president that the world can root for and be inspired by because having much of the world on our side again would not only be good for our national security it would be good for business
7980463 for our country to have come so far since 1960 is amazing at least to me and a lot of the progress comes thanks to democrats whove overwhelmingly been leaning forward with us against opposition at every step from an overwhelming majority of backward leaning republicans
7980464 for me this is a season of hope new hope for a justice and fair prosperity for the many and not just for the few new hope we can meet these challenges with barack obama yes we can and yes we will barack obama will close the book on the old politics of race and gender and group against group and straight against gay
7980465 i felt like these people dont hate me and would respect me if we met
7980466 many of the children i taught in public and charter schools in new york city and hawaii had never traveled outside of their neighborhoods for fear of feeling like outsiders i wanted them to know they belonged to something greater i wanted them to imagine wider dream bigger and reach higher i wanted them to realize they had more power than they knew

7980478 y es el profundo respeto pol tico que la sociedad palestina tiene por el trabajo que est realizando el aic lo que ha permitido que esto sea una realidad
7980479 la participaci n en el funeral de hoy de nuestros compa eros israel es que luchan con nosotros es una prueba tangible de que a n con todos los obst culos que pone la ocupaci n incluyendo el asedio de gaza la construcci n de asentamientos y la demolici n de casas de palestinos en jerusalem no puede evitar que se desarrollen buenas relaciones entre palestinos e israel es

7980531 by permitting transfer fees while including important consumer protections the california legislature struck a well reasoned balance between the benefits this important economic tool can provide and the need for adequate disclosure
7980532 if builders werent allowed to pass along costs in a transfer fee theyd have to make up for it by adding thousands of dollars to their homes initial selling price shutting out buyers
7980533 reconveyance financing helps keep home prices low by spreading costs over all beneficiaries of a project
7980534 transfer fees represent an equitable alternative to the current practice of forcing one hundred percent of development costs onto first time buyers by spreading costs over time buyers can buy for less prices can be kept more affordable and costs are distributed over those who benefit from improvements to property i admire the way freehold leverages private sector efficiencies to create long term funding for non profits and both the ethics and the economics of freeholds system are to be commended

7980547 i ask sir who is the militia it is the whole people to disarm the people that is the best and most effective way to enslave them
7980548 before a standing army can rule the people must be disarmed as they are in almost every kingdom in europe the supreme power in america cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword because the whole body of people are armed and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be on any pretense raised in the united states
7980549 that rifle on the wall of the laborers cottage or working class flat is the symbol of democracy it is our job to see that it stays there

7980564 nanotechnology adds an entirely new and largely unexplored realm of risks spread across the entire spectrum of modern commerce these emerging risks require a sophisticated approach by risk managers and businesses these risks carry with them the potential for far reaching effects on market cycles manufacturing and the safety security and well being of consumers the task of identifying these risks is complicated by the fact that scientists are still discovering how nanoparticles perform in manufactured products and how they react with humans and the environment
7980565 in addition corporate risk managers may not have recognized yet the role that nanotechnology is already playing or will be playing in their own businesses as nanotechnology plays a growing role in commerce insurers and underwriters will be increasingly taking these risks into account risk managers and insurers should strive to keep ahead of the issue of risk identification as nanotechnology makes its impact felt in the manufacturing legislative regulatory and legal arenas as well as in the realm of insurance underwriting

7980622 tells the story of a modern cabaret duo dixie wilson york an aspiring chanteuse who cant catch a break with a gig or a guy and billy daniels her sexy cocktail pianist who knows the songs and loves the ladies at the stroke of midnight on new years eve 1999 the century turns but in the wrong direction the duo is catapulted back in time before the hit songs of the 20th century have been created together billy and dixie co opt the songs that make the whole world sing becoming the stars theyve dreamed of being at the turn of the century
7980623 we literally had thousands of songs one hundred years worth of wonderful material at our fingertips but the choices were difficult because ultimately the songs must emerge from the psyche of these two principal characters billy and dixie who are choosing to perform them as their own
7980624 there is an emotional path running through the choice of the songs and at some point we make a subtle shift from the songs that they are stealing and releasing as their own to their own inner music
7980625 all of the songs in the show are classic songs but they are presented in a modern experience that introduces and reintroduces people to this music

7980690 people living along a border tribal linguistic or other are often quite likely to interact with people on the other side and are indeed more likely to interact with foreigners who are close by than with their own people who are at a greater distance the effect of these social relationships was to ensure that people in a border area were apt to have relatives across the border that is people who had married into the next tribal or linguistic group this clearly provided the social mechanism for contact and trade across tribal and linguistic boundaries once through the border zone introduced goods and ideas had little difficulty in diffusing internally within the homogeneous tribal territory boundary arbitration through intermarriage would tend to create haziness in and along border areas there would tend to be a hybridization of material items of the two groups in contact this discontinuity in the material record might be useful in identifying the location of the border

7980722 has faced questions about his banks multi million dollar loans to michael gioranago a convicted bookmaker and prostitution ring promoter
7980723 is concerned by revelations that the bank owned by illinois democratic treasurer nominee alexi giannoulias family gave loans to a chicago crime figure and said the candidate owes him and the public a full accounting
7980724 newly discovered public records show broadway bank made 11 8 million in additional mortgage loans to giorango just last year giannoulias said he oversaw the servicing of those loans
7980725 giannoulias is so tainted by reputed mob links that several top illinois dems including the states speaker of the house and party chairman refused to endorse him even after he won the democratic nomination with obamas help
7980726 and as the article points out money in chicago politics is often based on not ideology but corrupt favors so what exactly did casue giannoulias to stop donating to republicans and become such a huge donor to and fundraiser for obama

7980756 will the hiv medicine make my skin or eyes turn yellow
7980757 while we acknowledge that some people may find the headline and imagery of the materials to be provocative gsk stands firmly behind the ads and their underlying message patients considering changing hiv therapy ought to consult closely with their physician to fully understand the near and potential long term health implications of such changes
7980758 just as likely to encourage a patient to stay with another medicine as it is one of our own assuming that the medicine is working for a patient and is well tolerated

7980771 so this num ber is subject to change throughout the year
7980772 nova scotians depending on the price of home heating fuel could have a very tough winter
7980773 we are determined to do what is necessary to bring in a balanced budget
7980774 high energy prices are good for the government of nova sco tia
7980775 lets make no mistake about it when ener gy prices go up the royalties go up a lot and the costs of running the government go up a little
7980776 in contrast high energy prices are a disaster for the peo ple of nova scotia something is seriously out of balance here
7980777 ordinary nova scotians are going to be faced with the ener gy crisis that this government has been unable to deal with
7980778 epidemiologists track infections in something much closer to real time than was previously possible
7980779 their ability to say that theyre going to have ongoing reliable reports of hiv incidence is somewhat questionable unless you have funding for that

7980781 the very absence of a government may have helped nurture an african oddity a lean and efficient business sector that does not feed at a public trough controlled by corrupt officials
7980782 mogadishu has the closest thing to an ayn rand style economy that the world has ever seen no bureaucracy or regulation at all
7980783 the city has had no government since 1991 somali investors are making things happen not waiting for them to happen
7980784 is based on trust and so far it has worked owing to somalias tightly woven clan networks everyone knows everyone else so its less likely that an unknown con man will pull off a scam
7980785 if the business community succeeds in returning mogadishu to something resembling normalcy
7980786 it will have shown that a failed state or at least its capital city can get back on its feet without much help from the outside world

7980792 we have proposed that the mutual fund companies will tie up with the insurance companies and offer insurance products the premium for which will be collected separately
7980793 the association chairman is of the view that this will add greater diversity to the mutual fund offering to the investors if allowed mutual funds may come up with different insurance covers tagged with their products
7980794 it will see mutual funds offering insurance as bundled product and then the customer will have the choice to decide
7980795 looking at broader conditions today industry is assessing very hard whether to make that incremental investment or not
7980796 the pipeline investment is happening but for incremental investment there is a lot of thought going into it
7980797 it is going to be neutral on earnings per share eps in the near term in an onsite model there is not much cost advantage as you pay in the same currency you earn in
7980798 it has added some high profile clients like honda ford and nissan along with some big names in the pharmaceutical sector
7980799 smaller towns and cities in tier ii and iii category shows tremendous growth prospect for the organised retail industry these are the towns where aspirations of the youth are high
7980800 the competition will get hotter in the smaller towns and cities in about five years
7980801 we are possibly the only retailer who has such a large footprint across the country in fact its not just tier ii cities but we have a presence in tier iii and tier iv cities as well
7980802 inflation does have a marginal impact but as value retailers it is at these times that we can get the customer to come to our stores in droves because of the offers we give them
7980803 aadhar provides farmers with solutions to problems regarding their agricultural output which includes what kind of crop can they plant and when along with techno commercial suggestions to help them give a better output we also provide them with insurance products to cover their risk and supermarkets for their daily needs

7980815 our aircraft will outperform the boeing 737 and airbus a320 will it outrun foreign planes of the next generation i do not know the answer so far
7980816 we are ambitious but not so much so that to occupy the whole market of medium range aircraft half of the russian market and 10 of the world one will be enough
7980817 this job matters to me because it is an opportunity to use the skills that i have developed over the last 20 years to make a difference and to influence the future of military aircraft flight test
7980818 it is a very different rush from the one you get as a fresh faced fighter pilot on your first tour of duty i think most aircrew would agree the absolute exhilaration you get as a youngster doing things for the first time is replaced by a more measured experience in test flying it means we can still draw on the excitement but focus more on evaluating things like the weapon system in a professional and more dispassionate manner
7980819 a mixed journey for test pilots because everyone knows the future is more aligned to unmanned air systems and more automation in general but this does not mean that test pilots cant add value
7980820 even though the ability to assess handling qualities is now argueably less important it will be a long transformation
7980821 this multiyear award will yield a cost savings of more than 449 million for the u s army and taxpayers

7980823 the army is committed to providing an outstanding ch 47f chinook aircraft to our soldiers in the field
7980824 this multiyear award not only allows the army to field this important aircraft at a substantial savings but enabled the contractor to enter long term agreements for specialty metals to include titanium which significantly reduced long lead times for these critical materials the army was able to reduce the lead time associated with a new build aircraft by six months
7980825 this multiyear settlement is the result of the tireless efforts of government and boeing representatives it ensures that our soldiers will maintain a technological advantage over our adversaries when it comes to heavy lift missions
7980826 a long term contract commitment is good for the warfighter the army customer and u s business
7980827 this award enables boeing and our team chinook partners to make capital investments to reduce lead times for parts and components improve parts availability and provide for a more accurate delivery schedule which will enable greater precision in fielding the chinook to u s army units
7980828 in this recent test navy strategic systems programs has again demonstrated the reliability and credibility of the fleet ballistic missile

7980830 only with a better understanding of the transatlantic slave trade will we be able to tackle its legacies
7980831 today 12 3 million people are still forced to work against their will trafficked into slavery forced into bonded labour or born as slaves
7980832 learning about the transatlantic slave trade will help students better understand modern slavery and will hopefully inspire a new generation of abolitionists to take up the fight to stamp out slavery in all its forms
7980833 although we may sometimes be ashamed to admit it the slave trade is an integral part of british history

7980885 the springboks will get worse if they continue in this way
7980886 everyone has discipline policies and a procedure in their game the way he is talking is nonsense you cant just play an expansive wide game
7980887 this is still a very good squad of players most are even at their peak or approaching it so there is plenty of talent but what they need is the organisation and discipline
7980888 the hard thing for peter is that he has never coached professionally and this is one of the most difficult teams to coach
7980889 theyre attacking off everything and theyre going lateral not through defences you have to go through sides like australia and new zealand first
7980890 peters big test now is to learn if he learns he can turn it around but if he continues to be stubborn he wont last long because his tactics wont work
7980891 i would like to make it clear that springbok coach peter de villiers his management team and playing squad have my unequivocal backing and that of the south african rugby union presidents council and of the board of sa rugby pty ltd

7980899 in this situation the ball is in the europeans court
7980900 if they want relations to worsen they will get it
7980901 but if they want to save a strategic relationship which is absolutely in the interest of both russia and europe everything will be fine
7980902 this is contrary to the principles of the independence the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia
7980903 examine from this point of view the consequences of russias decision
7980904 i hope that our european partners will understand how to separate the wheat from the chaff and that we will be able to build normal and fruitful future relations
7980905 i think that georgia should be a normal state completely separate as regards its sovereignty it is of course a complex question one that will ultimately be determined by its relations with its neighbours
7980906 georgia must learn lessons from what has happened its a serious lesson one about how to construct relations with your close neighbours and with people who once were part of georgia
7980907 russian troops are only found in the buffer zone covered under the sarkozys six point plan interpretation of which has varied significantly between moscow and the west
7980908 the number of people without health insurance coverage decreased to 45 7 million people in 2007
7980909 generally what the report shows is that there has been some change but its pretty minor
7980910 this isnt progress the changes are insignificant and we would need to see this happen for 10 years to say there has been progress
7980911 you have to remember that the numbers in the report are from last year this year americans have been faced with record high petrol prices and rising food prices unemployment is also up meaning fewer americans have access to employer health benefits
7980912 in 2006 the number of poor elderly people would be higher by 12 6 million people if social security payments were excluded from money income more than quadrupling the number of poor elderly

7980924 for the avoidance of doubt the only person who can officially open parliament will be determined by the outcome of the ongoing dialogue
7980925 we will not attend we dont expect any member of the executive to address us until that dialogue has been concluded
7980926 after 20 minutes the pilot called nyala airport to tell him the plane had been hijacked and that he is en route to tripoli in libya
7980927 i am worried about my father and mother they are coming from nyala on this flight no one has any information about the situation they are in
7980928 this is the result of what the government is doing in the camps of displaced people in nyala
7980929 im not sure if its connected to kalma but its related to that the government kills and the international community does not intervene what can the darfurian people do
7980930 whatever you do for the least of these you do for me

7980934 tonight when hillary clinton speaks she will be an articulate voice for the working men and women the middle class families that have been squeezed and she will make the case as she uniquely can for why barack obama is the right choice for the presidency
7980935 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7980936 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7980937 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7980938 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and me our country will be committed to his cause
7980939 the work will begin anew the hope will rise again and the dream lives on
7980940 from now on asg will be part of the neo group
7980941 as you certainly know we have been in touch with some of the uk dominant players for more than 2 years now we recently thoroughly re analyzed the uk market and concluded that it was the right timing for neo to enter it and asg the right vehicle to do so
7980942 from now on asg will be part of neo group benefiting from its supply chain its knowledge sharing programs and its sales leveraging power with the help of neo asg can certainly position itself as the key dooh player in the uk
7980943 i have spent days and nights thinking about why i said what i did in front of the sec on may 25 2007
7980944 my statement before the sec was completely out of character for me i have tried to live my life in a way that showed that hard work and honesty were their own reward
7980945 i thank god who has been with me through this gruelling election process i thank the voters
7980946 the message is clear we have made a demand for change for freedom and for justice
7980947 the people do not want to be exploited we want an economic order that protects all the people
7980948 yes of course we have lost we were the underdogs going into this race
7980949 this is a clear indication that people of all races have rejected the communal politics of barisan nasional it is a clear endorsement of our reform agenda we are on track to take over the government
7980950 the positions brussels and washington have taken lest it slow its progress toward integrating with the west
7980951 the sharpening of relations between russian on the one hand and the us the european union and nato on the other raise questions about the ability of president boris tadic to achieve the policy goals
7980952 serbia both economically and geopolitically cannot be oriented toward russia alone
7980953 many governments prefer not to support the serbian russian tandem
7980954 contradictory a no to the independence of kosovo and a yes to the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia
7980955 will not help serbia to insist on its territorial integrity neither formally and legally nor in political practice
7980956 expressed its dissatisfaction that serbia and also bosnia and herzegovina apparently have sold arms to georgia while belgrade and sarajevo deny this and regardless of whether russias claims are true the fact that moscow made such a statement shows that relations are not good
7980957 considerably more dissatisfaction and anger in moscow than in belgrade
7980958 if the peoples of abkhazia and south ossetia want to live independently then the leadership of the russian federation ought to respond and support their independence because a people has the right to define how and where its members want to live
7980959 the need to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia one can understand that
7980960 it is not clear why the president of chechnya a republic
7980961 i would openly say stop and think gentlemen why did you bomb shoot and kill us
7980962 certain that neither the ossetians nor the abkhazians had suffered one hundredth as much as we suffered during the course of two wars and that they have not lost 10 percent as many victims as we did
7980963 putins attempts to restore the great imperial past of muscovy should become the beginning of the end for this deformed pseudo state formation
7980964 if the west does not miss the chance to end once and for all the muscovite threat then the development of free russian lands blocked in the 14th century will be begin again
7980965 the collapse of the soviet union as the biggest tragedy of the 20th century
7980966 under the pretext of peacekeeping and defending the rights of the ossetians and the abkhazians russia invaded the territory of the sovereign state of georgia
7980967 a desperate attempt to expand the borders of the empire and even if moscow recognizes the independence of the two breakaway republics that step
7980968 a serious obstacle on the way to the fulfillment of russias imperial goals unfortunately in the current situation the ossetians and abkhazians have played the role of docile puppets in the hands of moscow
7980969 like many other small nations inside russia they will become its victims
7980970 the first nation to be captured by the russian empire
7980971 know very well what it is to live under russian domination
7980972 because of pressure and threats from moscow the international community did not recognize
7980973 had been hoping that russia would become a democratic state
7980974 trying to revive the old soviet empire by brutal force
7980975 the tatar nation has only one way to break away from this russia asking the international community to recognize now the independence of the republic of tatarstan
7980976 russia is going to recognize the independence of georgias breakaway regions why then cannot the tatar nation which has a tradition of independence in the past but was brutally invaded by russia in 1552 not ask for and even expect international recognition of its independence
7980977 we are compelled to seek assistance from the international community
7980978 help us to build a free democratic and independent country oil rich tatarstan does not want any more to give aid to russia
7980979 hee supermarkt a deze week even wat minder bestellen ik heb een buurtpoll gehouden en ze gaan massaal op vakantie zonde van de spullen
7980980 georgia is to russia what cuba is to the us
7980981 part of the russian mass media is simply repeating the information of the dpni the movement against illegal immigration
7980982 show yet again the intentions moscow had when it invaded the territory of georgia
7980983 such a step would be dangerous for the political image of russia because the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia are recognized by the entire international community
7980984 then this can be interpreted as a retreat from the promises it gave to the west community
7980985 if it does not start the process of recognition then it will be retreating from promises given to abkhazia and south ossetia
7980986 avoid a situation when after russia no one will recognize abkhazia and south ossetia besides belarus cuba or venezuela
7980987 mean that the sovereignty of the two would be solidified
7980988 society could overthrow this system the oligarchs called for the help of the siloviki
7980989 and those oligarchs who did not want to live according to the rules established by the officers of the special services
7980990 acknowledge their own past mistakes since some of them supported the yeltsin system and others insufficiently effectively struggled against it
7980991 the communists wanted to construct a just society without freedom this experiment failed after 70 years at the end of the 20th century russias democrats attempted to construct a free society sacrificing justice in pursuit of that aim that attempt failed after ten years
7980992 there is no freedom without justice and there is no justice without freedom
7980993 have not learned any of the lessons of the past
7980994 on the explanation of the motives and logic of the actions of those in power
7980995 is in the first instance the history of the powers that be
7980996 in the civil war the bolsheviks were guilty but at the same time the white movement represented an alternative pro fascist direction
7980997 there was no organized famine in the countryside of the ussr
7980998 the molotov ribbentrop was a response to the munich accords
7980999 the introduction of soviet forces onto the territory of poland in 1939 was for the liberation of the territories of ukraine and belarus
7981000 a response to the lost of many tens of thousands of red army en in polish prisons after the 1920 war the initiator of which was not soviet russia but poland
7981001 it is important to show that stalin acted in a completely rational way as the protector of the system and as a consistent supporter of the transformation of the country into an industrial society administered from a single center as the leader of a country which was threatened with a big war in the most immediate future
7981002 terror was put to the service of the tasks of industrial development
7981003 needed for the solution of defense and other tasks to the far east and to siberia
7981004 the terror was transformed into a pragmatic instrument for the solution of economic tasks
7981005 a year has passed the effective manger has become the successful administrator and mass terror has been explained from a rational point of view what has taken place in our country over the course of the year that the authors continue to advance such claims
7981006 est claramente demostrado que cuando se trata de apoyar a barack obama se al las celebridades que lo respaldan no entienden de l mites en cuanto a campa as difamatorias o ataques

7981011 i have some friends who believe and dress in a similar manner a very good friend is mennonite and i hold the highest respect for her and her lifestyle she is a gentle and good woman i am curious as to what passages say that women should wear dresses and or skirts there are feminine pants in stores that are only made for women these days that are considered not to be mens clothing at all im not arguing just curious about this my father taught me that if something is important for us to believe god made sure it was in several places in scripture i cannot find anything biblical to back up the skirts only so i am asking someone who does believe this what am i missing in the bible

7981020 lets talk about how absolutely awful it was trying to leave the polo fields when radiohead ended we stood at a complete standstill for about 45 minutes before making it to the fence and we were able to avoid jumping the fence like so many others we thought we were in the clear until a hive of bees attacked those of us leaving the fields bees people with stingers i was stung no less than six times once in my hand
7981021 its still early but id be surprised if i see anything at outside lands that impresses me more than the coups set its always the same deal with this east bay troupe led by genius rapper boots riley whether they are playing coachella or rock the bells or now outside they always seem to outshine the competition

7981025 earlier at the border crossing into south ossetia we met one man who was taking his wife and children from that republics capital tskhinvali
7981026 is consistent with mounting indications that russia had been planning an attack on georgia in advance and was just waiting for a pretext to carry it out
7981027 russias state controlled media seemed extremely well prepared to cover the outbreak of armed conflict in georgia tv immediately presented elaborate graphics with news anchors and commentators appearing to stick to disciplined talking points accusing georgian president mikheil saakashvili of aggression and the georgian armed forces of genocide and ethnic cleansing
7981028 the speed of the russian response suggests that the russians were ready they were just waiting

7981063 in most of canterbury the issue is mainly about allocation but not quality so you may not be able to use the whole of the model there might be places where nutrient concerns as well as quantity could be used
7981064 obviously with the number of takes you have got in canterbury you probably are a reasonable place to start and see if this model could work if the government could help provide metering set up the registry
7981065 indications are that for example a national registry might be 30m to put in place thats a one off cost

7981099 russias victory over georgia the spirit was second world war defiance the music was from leningrad and the conductor was a russian citizen who now works in london
7981100 from the mournful first bars of shostakovichs symphony no 7 known as the leningrad in the makeshift arena
7981101 it was clear that the theme of the night was a stirring appeal to patriotism and the memories of russian suffering during the second world war
7981102 reminded him of pictures of stalingrad the city where soviet troops began to turn back the invading nazi army
7981103 everything around us our nation our freedom and our inviolable rights as something quite self evident but now after ten days of devastating news and horrifying images from georgia we are once again quite aware that freedom is not self evident www president ee en duties speeches php
7981104 freedom is not just a word or a declaration that can be scoffed at or smirked at
7981105 freedom presumes that we take notice of world events freedom presumes that we see ourselves as part of that complicated changing world
7981106 the importance of friendship with other countries and of being able to notice
7981107 we did not let georgia down and one day pressure from the international public is bound to banish the alien tanks from georgia
7981108 no country ever stands alone we can say again with pride
7981109 only if we have the courage to stand by our friends
7981110 we want our nation to last and we can make it last
7981111 in any case after 2017 the russian fleet will not be on our territory news mail ru politics 1960873
7981112 no one including russia can influence our decision if in moscow they do not yet understand this that governments live according to such rules throughout the world then this is russias problem
7981113 there is no need for russia to introduce forces because there is a sufficiently large and not badly armed contingent of the russian black sea fleet already there
7981114 close russian consulates which are violating the law by handing out to citizens of ukraine russian passports
7981115 who have illegal dual citizenship to annul one of the passports
7981116 for the achievement of these goals russia doesnt need a major military conflict with ukraine
7981117 it is sufficient to destabilize the situation in a single crimean region
7981118 the forces of the russian special services and particular units of the black sea fleet
7981119 actions directed at the sharpening of relations between personnel of the black sea fleet and representatives of ukrainian authority in nearby areas
7981120 the pro russian population will rise to the defense of the russian personnel
7981121 will begin clashes with the law enforcement bodies of ukraine
7981122 russia has already created all the necessary conditions for its realization
7981123 a war between the us and russia and also those who blame georgia and express the most anti georgian views tend to be more educated have higher incomes and live either in moscow or other urban centers in european russia
7981124 russia conducted itself in this conflict in an incorrect way
7981125 the causes of the conflict are connected with russias policies in the caucasus
7981126 russia had allowed itself to be provoked by georgia and that this will have negative consequences for the country
7981127 the law enforcement organs are working to establish whether these crimes were committed on the basis of racial hatred
7981128 which had always considered itself a place which showed tolerance to representatives of different nationalities was rapidly being transformed into one of the most aggressive nationalistic centers in the country
7981129 a heroic aura has frequently been created around the skinheads
7981130 in the city will begin a campaign to collect money to support them
7981131 nationalist attitudes in ulyanovsk almost certainly will continue to increase
7981132 during the first half of this year she told the national anti terrorist committee in moscow on tuesday
7981133 what were the losses on the russian and georgian sides
7981134 can be formulated in the following way russia attempted to show that it now can act just like america independently and without the agreement of the international community conduct military operations on the territory of a former state
7981135 the extent to which russia has been able to become almost america will become clear in the coming weeks
7981136 it is possible to judge on the basis of the first results that this goal if in fact it is the one that medvedev and putin set in this case has not been completely achieved
7981137 moscow could like to have in tbilisi a friendlier regime
7981138 it is even doubtful that moscow has been able to seriously discredit him
7981139 even after iraq the united states all the same was insured from such unpleasantness
7981140 therefore it is still too early apparently for russia to consider itself a second america
7981141 secure the borders step number 1 enforce the laws step number 2 hold employers accountable step 3 and we feel we need to end automatic birthright citizenship its the second most powerful magnet that attracts people to commit the crime of entering the country illegally knowing if they have a child here it becomes a citizen its not automatically a citizen
7981142 many people here dearly want to return home they wish they had the same opportunities in their country they dont want to live in the shadows
7981143 why dont they ask their president their congress to provide them with the same resources they seek in the u s by sending them home they are going to return home and create sweeping reform movements in their countries
7981144 pot plantations in our national parks and they sweep it and its all foreign nationals
7981145 you cannot have flies and mosquitoes to the point where its dangerous and people are going to the hospital you can not have flotsam and jetsam on these beaches to point where people who are walking along will trip on them will have nails come through their feet
7981146 russian forces last week defeated georgian forces on the territory of georgia their answers suggested a more variegated response than many in the west assume www kommersant ru doc aspx docsid 1011982
7981147 yes russia is successfully fulfill the international obligations it took upon itself
7981148 stands behind the back of saakashvili and who directed this barbaric act of aggression
7981149 did not have any other way out but to get involved in the conflict but that which follows from this raises a multitude of questions
7981150 ashamed for russias representative at the united nations when the latter spoke as if tbilisi had attacked russia when in fact
7981151 never seen an occasion to be proud of her country with the exception of the events of august 1991 and october 1993
7981152 what is happening now is a shame and a disgrace
7981153 would have been more proud of the priorities had been more directed to the side of humanitarian assistance and the evacuation of citizens
7981154 it was necessary to stop and above all help people
7981155 russia must start from the principle of territorial integrity and here
7981156 must think not only about the participants of the current conflict but also about its very own future
7981157 in russia there are an enormous number of such territories which after a certain time could theoretically follow the path of south ossetia and abkhazia
7981158 we do not know what will take place 10 15 or 20 years from now
7981159 at the present time it is practically impossible to imagine that the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia will ever agree to live within the framework of a united georgia
7981160 provoking the kremlin to recognize the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia
7981161 a parade of sovereignty declarations by national republics now within russia
7981162 russia needs a unitary state if it does not set one up then the country will collapse
7981163 if our present regime with a democratic state is preserved then we will be forced over the course of the next 30 to 40 years to follow the kosovo variant
7981164 we will have to tell our grandchildren that they will live in a different country learn a different language and possibly profess a different faith i do not want this for my children
7981165 if the russians come back this time they wont be constrained by communism
7981166 obligated to defend the life and well being of russian citizens regardless of where they are located
7981167 the russian federation guarantees its citizens defense and protection beyond its borders
7981168 the question of the possibility of using the armed forces of the russian federation beyond the borders
7981169 was given for peacekeepers and not for the entire 58th army which is now being called
7981170 the organs of state power are not only the government and the president but also the parliament consisting of the state duma and federation council and the entire system of federal courts
7981171 the single reliable path for the transportation of azerbaijani energy carriers has again become the russian pipeline system from baku to novorossiisk and tanker transfers up the volga river
7981172 the current state of demand for fuel in the world allows for surviving such an inconvenience
7981173 there is a probability that the situation in georgia with regard to energy transit will last for quite a long time
7981174 azerbaijan and georgia are thus now subject to the close attention of western democracies
7981175 the official explanation of the necessity of the presence of units under the nato flag may become the defense of energy transport facilities
7981176 baku forced to significantly reduce the pumping of oil immediately stopped using the baku batumi and baku kulevi rail lines again in connect with military actions in georgia
7981177 in official versions are being invoked almost exclusively political reasons
7981178 turkey intends to buy additional supplies from russia and iran
7981179 suggests that one ought not to ignore any of them
7981180 the extent of foreign investment in the russian economy was 22 9 percent less in the first half of 2008 than for the first half of last year
7981181 in the opinion of specialists the latest geopolitical and economic shocks have only increased the negative attitudes of investors
7981182 as a result of the conflict in south ossetia the mechel affair and the scandal around tnk bp we have lowered our prediction on the inflow of foreign investment from 40 to 30 billion us dollars
7981183 after the beginning of the armed conflict western creditors cut and then closed credit limits for western companies thus it is possible to expect a reduction of the inflow of credit from abroad and an increase in their cost
7981184 it is early to speak about a serious blow to the economy of russia
7981185 citizens and transport of member states of the commonwealth of independent states and also the rolling stock of the latvian republic the lithuanian republic and the estonian republic
7981186 there are no changes in the regulations of passing borders between azerbaijan and russia
7981187 i didnt know i was speeding because i couldnt read the speed limit sign
7981188 we are working with fema to get to the bottom of it
7981189 in this case its sort of embarrassing that it happened to fema themselves fema being a child of dhs with calls going to the middle east
7981190 this illegal activity enables unauthorized individuals anywhere in the world to communicate via compromised u s phone systems in a way that is difficult to trace
7981191 i think its clear that alberta is still leading the nation
7981192 will likely produce life threatening flash floods and mud slides
7981193 with isolated maximum amounts of up to 50 centimetres possible
7981194 gustav continues to represent a potential threat to oil and gas installations in the gulf region and will be watched with vigilance
7981195 given the current track for gustav and the expectation that it might enter the gulf of mexico this weekend we are making logistical arrangements to evacuate staff who are not essential to production or drilling operations
7981196 evacuations could begin as early as tomorrow there is no impact on production at this time
7981197 in the face of the danger threatening haiti i ask national civil protection committees and our friends in international cooperation to help the government manage the risks and disasters
7981198 this was an endlessly fascinating process already and its still got some twists and turns between now and november
7981199 but underneath that and in the background there is also a different story which we dont want to unearth much on the convention floor because its not really what were trying to do but which you should be mindful of
7981200 it seems to me everyone in the world should be obsessed with this
7981201 the other problem is that politicians do themselves no good by delivering actual safety if it is accompanied by a perceived increase in risk so we get laws from traffic stops to airport security that enhance the perception of security while doing little to nothing to actually make us safer
7981202 theres nothing quite so infuriating as seeing some idiot with southern plates driving his jeep too fast in the snow because he doesnt realize that four wheel drive provides faster acceleration but does nothing for his stopping radius too often he gets a rapid education in automotive physics when he skids into the back of a minivan being driven at sensible speed
7981203 after describing how she and her husband came to where they are hard work striving in the face of obstacles she concludes we need change change the things that made them successful
7981204 boston drivers are some of the worst in the us rain or shine
7981205 havent you made out all right under the current system how could you be so ungrateful to suggest we change
7981206 players who have been part of the sytem for a few years like bobby sanguinetti tommy pyatt brodie dupont and artem aninsimov as well as 2008 draft picks michael del zotto evgeny grachev recently signed defenseman tomas kundratek and dale weise
7981207 it s possible but not likely that sakic will say that day whether that he will play in the upcoming season or retire
7981208 as for the content of the press conference it will most likely consist of 1 sakic a native canadian accepting the democratic nomination as a candidate for president of the united states and or 2 absolutely nothing about the status of his hockey career
7981209 would like to play if his foot problems are solved and hes checking away at that
7981210 while sakic has been pondering whether to resume his playing career there has been some speculation in nhl circles that the avalanche is interested in pursuing toronto maple leafs free agent center mats sundin who also is unsure about his future
7981211 nhl circles are sources which hockey journalists once employed to sniff test rumors like this considered circles are rumor sites circles weve encountered a lot of circular logic on the hf boards are those nhl circles too
7981212 speculation circles interested in pursuing if a blog had written this would you have given it more than five seconds of consideration before hitting the red x in the corner of your browser window just sayin
7981213 with shoulders like this every time you do something for the first time it feels terrible
7981214 it doesnt feel like where you want to be but the second time its way better its like the first time i did a push up four weeks ago oh my god and the next day i could have done 10 you build your shoulder and confidence
7981215 not being able to shoot like i normally can was disappointing
7981216 but after five or six times im not 100 percent but its getting better and my shots are getting better
7981217 the senators already have defencemen chris phillips anton volchenkov christoph schubert brian lee jason smith lawrence nycholat brendan bell and matt carkner under contract
7981218 but that s not a solid deadline bogosian s contract and potential bonus money should put the thrashers over the nhl payroll minimum of 40 7 million which they need to reach before the start of the season
7981219 for a long time no team has won the stanley cup twice in a row so i want to win it again
7981220 but i cant have complete happiness without olympic gold if the national team coaches want me in the team at the games in vancouver i will certainly agree
7981221 theres a need the nations at risk and this is what were called on to do
7981222 we flew several missions into saigon both into bien hoa and tan son nhut
7981223 you know it was an exciting time for a young fella and a good way to get started
7981224 because it will tell you a lot about what i believe in
7981225 his motto was a promise made is a promise kept
7981226 it tells what his inner being is like the special operators really rely on one another and entrust their lives to one another
7981227 so i said schwartz your no 1 job is to finish first in the class and if you got time you know in the evenings or whatever to teach pneumatics hydraulics and electrics to lieutenants then be my guest well he taught pneumatics hydraulics and electrics to all the lieutenants and the captains who needed it plus finished first in his class
7981228 gen schwartz was always if you will under the gun sometimes we would hit a home run sometimes we would have to go back for more homework
7981229 but it never changed his demeanor hes very level when it comes to his demeanor and the way he approaches problems
7981230 all types of airplanes and trying to get the budget to put the capital fleet if you will back on its feet
7981231 but at the same time i dont intend to be timid about explaining why it is america needs to invest in its air force
7981232 traffic destined to this airport is being delayed at its departure point
7981233 thats a strange looking bump more of an indentation oh thats his skull
7981234 burning flames breathing fame of our own demise that remains the same
7981235 i like your hair my daughter used to do her hair like that i like your shirt whered you get that my daughter used to shop there

7981237 yeah thats my daughter and her son she was found raped and killed 5 years ago
7981238 i think it would be great for my tenants and it would ease traffic flow and hang ups on route 1
7981239 we are currently in discussions with the pet store owner to resolve any potential conflict
7981240 i wanted to construct a building that was aesthetically pleasing that would fit in with the atmosphere here and wasnt an eyesore to the community

7981254 race card have you been asleep since jesse helmss funeral no way
7981255 guys guys didnt you learn anything from bill clinton in the primaries you cant just come right out and say dont vote for the funny lookin black guy theres a third way we can hit him with everything except race thereby stoking those racist fears in the minds of so many in our base fox will be the mouthpiece we can even buy a little airtime from clowns like mark halperin and joe scarborough
7981256 i i i dunno im more comfortable bob jonesing obama the way we did our guy in 2000 that shit worked
7981257 it worked then 2008 is different like it or not after al gores movie and with whoopi on the view were better off accepting global warming and that whole idea of equality between races and genders but thats what im saying you guys theres another way
7981258 since weve got all the 527s and jerry corsis out there what the official campaign does is tie this guy at every possible juncture to terrorism home grown and international weve got the madrasah thing weve got bill ayres jeremiah wright weve got him advocating withdrawal from iraq opposing the surge it wont be difficult to connect the dots for voters rather than let them draw their own conclusions and trust me soft on terror will be more effective than the played out change meme
7981259 youre onto something should we run this by jmcc or just roll with it

7981271 nobody thinks that these boats will break the siege in a practical way but this is a moral message what is happening in gaza is illegal and inhumane and must be halted
7981272 in this media war it was impossible for them israel to win because they have no case for what they are doing to your port and to your borders
7981273 we were all dizzy nauseous we were all tired but in the last hour it was like we were recharged
7981274 it was clear from the beginning that this whole operation was a provocation aimed at making israel look bad
7981275 we decided to let them through in order not to play into their hands
7981276 the first was to prevent a media provocation on the high seas
7981277 and the second is because we knew who was on the boat and that the equipment they were bringing in was humanitarian equipment for deaf people
7981278 we call for more activities to break the unfair siege imposed on our people

7981284 frank ikard jr a lawyer for mr simmonss older daughter scheryle s patigian said that she was only trying to remove harold simmons from control of the trust
7981285 the estranged daughters andrea swanson and scheryle s patigian contended their 66 year old father had abused his power in controlling the two trusts that hold most of the fortune he amassed as a corporate raider in the 1970s and 1980s
7981286 in using one of his first three line item vetoes president clinton today dashed a texas billionaires plan to preserve a capital gains tax break while renegotiating the sale of one of his businesses and in doing so mr clinton highlighted the sort of special benefits that have long found their way into the nations tax laws often to the benefit of only a handful of wealthy or influential people in this case the president unraveled the plans of 2 000 beet farmers and of harold c simmons who has given more than 1 million to republican candidates and causes since the early 1980s a provision in the tax bill included at the behest of several members of congress would have granted mr simmons and the oregon beet farmers something they all desired a graceful exit out of a cumbersome joint venture they had formed for the sole purpose of cutting mr simmonss tax bill to defer or avoid at least 80 million in capital gains taxes on the sale of a beet sugar refining company mr simmons formed the joint venture with the snake river sugar cooperative which the beet farmers had set up for the purpose the joint venture was to own the plant sharing profits under existing tax laws this arrangement was not technically a sale and mr simmons owed no capital gains taxes even though the cooperative paid him 260 million

7981356 you know its easy for me to sit here now and say im clean and i havent done this and i havent done that but its not that easy i am happy with where im at the moment though
7981357 we are living in a pc world which is destroying us where you actually cant put the hard word on people when they have digressed and committed bad blunders
7981358 in the evenings we went to the rugby parties with the kids who slept in the back of the car we cant do that any more because we havent got rid of the perpetrators that actually destroy our society

7981364 just as in the world of politics there is need for free thought likewise in the world of religion there should be the right of unrestricted individual belief consider what a vast difference exists between modern democracy and the old forms of despotism under an autocratic government the opinions of men are not free and development is stifled whereas in democracy because thought and speech are not restricted the greatest progress is witnessed it is likewise true in the world of religion when freedom of conscience liberty of thought and right of speech prevail that is to say when every man according to his own idealization may give expression to his beliefs development and growth are inevitable
7981365 the divine religion is reality and reality is not multiple it is one therefore the foundations of the religious systems are one because all proceed from the indivisible reality but the followers of these systems have disagreed discord strife and warfare have arisen among them for
7981366 if christians of all denominations and divisions should investigate reality the foundations of christ will unite them
7981367 t here is no such thing as an orthodox bahai
7981368 full recognition of the station of the forerunner the author and the true exemplar of the bah cause as set forth in s testament unreserved acceptance of and submission to whatsoever has been revealed by their pen loyal and steadfast adherence to every clause of our beloveds sacred will and close association with the spirit as well as the form of the present day bah administration throughout the world
7981369 of the will and testament of including but not limited to that clause that provides for a continuing succession of guardians who are to be the sacred head for life of the universal house of justice
7981370 close association with spirit and form of the present day bah administration
7981371 such a condition we must not allow to happen even though we be but a mere handful a very small number of followers faithful to the covenant and the administration of the guardianship we with all the world in violation against us must stand together and support the guardianship
7981372 we must stand in firmness for the guardianship that is the administration of our faith
7981373 therefore friends of the bah faith arise and maintain the life center the heart and the soul of the abh kingdom upon earth that is the guardianship for only by our so doing will the cause of el abh be saved for this world
7981374 its not a matter of moving beyond the olympics that will always be part of our fabric this is about reinforcing the brand that we have spent a considerable amount of effort time and money on in the last three years

7981388 its probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their child words baby and daddy in english papa in italian and tata grandpa in hungarian for example
7981389 the language centre of most right handed adults is located on the left side of the brain
7981390 this is consistent with our finding with new born babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently
7981391 the brain areas that are responsible for language in an adult do not learn how to process language during development but rather they are specialized at least in part to process language from the start
7981392 the concept of independent scientific review has been in practice since the 18th century and is crucial to ensuring that ideas and proposed work are scientifically sound
7981393 this overhaul of the endangered species act would place the fate of rare species in the hands of government stakeholders who are not qualified to assess the environmental impacts of their activities
7981394 what if we allowed pharmaceutical companies to approve and distribute drugs without consulting the food and drug administration

7981400 we have observed previously that the idea of smoking a cigarette becomes increasingly attractive to smokers while they are craving
7981401 this study suggests that when smokers are not craving they fail to appreciate just how powerful their cravings will be this lack of insight while not craving may lead them to make decisions such as choosing to attend a party where there will be lots of smoking that they may come to regret
7981402 these findings suggest that smokers are likely to underpredict their own future desire to smoke when theyre not craving a cigarette
7981403 the research not only has implications for helping smokers quit but it also enlightens us on how nonsmokers may pick up the habit if smokers cant appreciate the intensity of their need to smoke when they arent currently craving whats the likelihood that people who have never smoked can do so
7981404 the take home message for women is that whether you are hooked on caffeine or not if you need a boost coffee improves your mental alertness and can have a calming affect on your heart rate
7981405 in addition a large coffee has more than enough caffeine to see these changes
7981406 this indicates that there may be some long term cardiovascular adjustment to digesting caffeine on a daily basis
7981407 for people at risk for high blood pressure if youre a habituated coffee drinker reducing your caffeine intake would be an effective way of potentially reducing your blood pressure
7981408 we never considered that interferon alpha could be a major player in early type 1 diabetes

7981435 the mayors award worthy post k achievements are subject to debate as was evidenced by the 75 or so underdressed protesters outside the ritz friday night although i am convinced these philistines were less aggrieved by the mayors questionable leadership than by the fact that they were not invited to the party
7981436 oh heehee im one of the good guys undercover at the fabulous mayors party and all the shiny rich people dont hate me really im not like them
7981437 this outbreak is really taxing us and we think a provincial consensus is needed to determine whether we should just resign ourselves to large numbers of cases or determine what to do to mitigate the spread through some sort of immunization campaign
7981438 after all this is not a trivial disease weve had many cases resulting in hospitalizations and complications
7981439 theres no guarantee it wont spread to the vancouver region
7981440 at the moment there is some evidence that it is moving out of the faith based communities and into the broader communities

7981449 fellowship of friends is a cult whose sole purpose despite its claims supporting its tax exempt status is to satisfy the sexual financial and power needs of robert burton the leader
7981450 burtons word is law and cannot be questioned because he is awake while his followers are asleep and therefore cannot think for themselves
7981451 cults induce brainwashing an inducement into an ideology that then gets practiced
7981452 you are not supposed to be leaving your family youre supposed to be becoming free of your unnecessary ties
7981453 i was treated as though i was saying something wrong
7981454 every time you turn around youre getting nickled and dimed

7981475 satanism is big in this area these kids are getting up to all sorts of evil
7981476 pop groups like slipknot and programmes like reaper together with any rituals of satanism contribute towards a climate of instability and immorality
7981477 that music is satanic its not good for young people and it really makes them do harmful things
7981478 satanism in all the schools in the country it just hasnt manifested itself yet
7981479 if you do not spend time with your children someone or something else will
7981480 we have a group of detectives who are in the process of exposing more and more detectives to the investigation of harmful religious practices
7981481 if there is not a crime involved there is religious freedom
7981482 they start to reject everything that is moral coming from their school and their parents they think they are on a higher level in a relationship with some kind of supernatural deity
7981483 they take this very literally so the vengeance issue becomes very active
7981484 lets face it it is a religion of the flesh
7981485 there is no cyber prohibition children are curious and start exploring these things
7981486 it starts with white magic it goes to gateway religious systems and then to destructive religions it is pretty prevalent
7981487 i wont go as far as to say it leads to that kind of violence generally
7981488 in most cases it boils down to an emotional need
7981489 they often knew the different religions and belief systems very well but had chosen to follow the route of satanism
7981490 there is a clear message that in our families we must get back to basics we must start loving our children and guiding them there is absolute carte blanche in a great deal of homes where children have no borders at all
7981491 i am going to sing about aids and i am going to sing about drug abuse and the things that are happening out there
7981492 its not giving us the closure we need today especially for her mother and the family
7981493 we have discovered new information revealing that todd bentley has entered into an unhealthy relationship on an emotional level with a female member of his staff
7981494 todd and shonnah bentley are presently experiencing significant friction in their relationship and are currently separated we want to affirm that there has been no sexual immorality on the part of either todd or shonnah nor has there ever been
7981495 i have in my hands the 13th testimony as a result of this outpouring of somebody raised from the dead
7981496 im saying to the media the dead are being raised are you ready to hear the 13th story now many of them weve been following up we still havent had a chance to verify this i can read it to you as i received it
7981497 i turned around and did what had happened to me i was assaulted too
7981498 the healing of the sick the casting out of devils the raising of the dead the cleansing of lepers this was all taking place
7981499 whatever they hand to us we will actively pursue if it is an arrest warrant
7981500 this has been a very painful process for the people
7981501 its certainly had a tremendous toll on everyone involved my heart certainly goes out to every one of these girls involved
7981502 we certainly believe theres a god and we believe he will judge
7981503 because the as the relationship got longer then i felt that i had an obligation to say something to them about what happened to me
7981504 if it hadnt been for a parent of one of the children there they could have operated a long time
7981505 he had religious garments on robes skullcaps he came across as very religious
7981506 there were little houses out back and some kind of ritual circle that he had made
7981507 he had this doomsday theory that was fascinating that california was going to slide off into the ocean and send a tidal wave from west to east the spot the mountain where thornton is would be safe he had writings to support it the guy was a genius a maniacal genius
7981508 they want shock value sensationalism and knit pick analysis of religious text in order to satisfy an inference
7981509 he was supposed to pray for me but instead he threw himself on top of me and knocked me to the ground
7981510 they should have interviewed somebody who is currently a member of the congregation in order to get a fairer picture
7981511 we didnt really have a sense of what was going on out there we knew there was a potential for a problem
7981512 the state has that evidence now or i believe they do
7981513 im praying to become a heavenly comfort wife for you i feel so close to you
7981514 cant be a crime because heavenly father is the one that tells warren when a girl is ready to get married
7981515 they couldnt find abuse the first time it came up whats changed
7981516 the prejudice against the religions and organizations is culled instantly by the names themselves
7981517 passages from the satanic bible are relevant evidence regarding the fact that it was the defendant who killed the children since the killings appear to have been part of a ritual the defendant had planned
7981518 rend that gaggling tongue and close his her throat oh kali
7981519 leads to the physical mental or emotional destruction of the sacrifice in ways and means not attributable to the magician
7981520 in short a person asking to be cursed by their very actions
7981521 as such there is great danger that the jury would be influenced to an excessive level simply by some references by the state to satanic religions or organizations
7981522 lastly the defendant provided some statements to the police which include references to paganism wiccanism and satanism
7981523 it is clear that the issue will be a frontspiece for the state to suggest that the defendant is evil unless the court sustains this motion
7981524 money is such a poor means of exchange for the value of a soul
7981525 we have been involved in extensive negotiations with plaintiffs and we hope we can reach a group resolution of the claims
7981526 based on advice from legal counsel and on prayerful reflection over this most difficult matter i believe that this settlement while costly is a responsible resolution for these individuals and their families and in the best interest of the diocese
7981527 of those 47 plaintiffs i dont know which ones im concerned with or which ones are concerned with me
7981528 in depositions that were made some of my accusers admitted that they didnt even know me
7981529 these are 47 families who have suffered from clergy abuse for years
7981530 they need to move on and the fact that money will be available soon is important
7981531 the members of this cult who were more than twice her age were calling the shots
7981532 it fits the profile of a classic cult in the sense that its a personality driven group and that queen antoinette is that animating personality and central defining element of the group
7981533 my daughter was very religious she was into the bible obsessed with it
7981534 they were going to show her the right way she got sucked into it
7981535 i fear for my grandsons and my daughters safety you see they are in a cult i havent seen or heard from my daughter since april
7981536 its a tragic tragic situation and we responded with the information that we had in a responsive way and unfortunately it didnt change the outcome
7981537 they were coaching her and telling her what to say
7981538 she sounded empty like an empty shell there was no emotion
7981539 i was shocked i didnt even recognize her voice its not the same person
7981540 he was smirking while mr ruan was saying where they went
7981541 he said oh well im sure that was a complete waste of time
7981542 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
7981543 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
7981544 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
7981545 global tour and is not targeting any specific player or country
7981546 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
7981547 the government has put this re competition on a very tight schedule
7981548 what you see here is the improbability of conducting a major competition in record time
7981549 its a series of small things that cumulatively add up
7981550 its not about which administration is in charge at this point
7981551 more banks will come on the troubled list as credit problems worsen
7981552 confidence is still quite depressed but its a glimmer of hope from the lows we saw in june
7981553 i attribute the increase to the drop in gasoline prices which offset a deteriorating labor market
7981554 other information that shows a pervasive pattern of spiritual marriages between older men and girls 17 and younger
7981555 who married underage girls or agreed to an arranged marriage of an underage daughter
7981556 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause
7981557 but ive got to say what i believe will get our country back on the right path
7981558 we need to water down our partys progressive ideals and principles to make them more palatable to our friends across the aisle and by friends across the aisle of course i mean the same people who have enabled and contributed to the erosion of america for the past 8 years thats the only way to pass legislation
7981559 i was afraid of obama the first time i saw him
7981560 after pleading guilty to conspiracy to vandalize government property they had relocated a wayward apostrophe and inserted a comma the young grammarians were barred from national parks for a year
7981561 live as if your were living for the second time and had acted as wrongly the first time as you are about to act now
7981562 they feel its their last chance in their lifetime to see a woman president
7981563 the media are making a mountain out of a mole hill
7981564 im as determined a hillary clinton supporter as youll find but i am enthusiastically behind obama
7981565 we have to end the years of republican authoritarian rule
7981566 each of these milestones is important in our progress and we thank our investors for their support and the european trading community for its overwhelming enthusiasm
7981567 were also glad to formally name eric to his new post he is a terrific addition to our impressive team
7981568 susan collins is politically adept but we all know shes a secret bush clone
7981569 blogcritics brings us closer to an open community of bloggers and the audience that follows them it also gives us a lot more advertising inventory
7981570 whats in it for them our combined resources will help that community grow and expose their work to an even wider audience well also work more closely with blogcritics authors so they can monetize their own blogs

7981595 in some other tribes in asia and africa they run a ring through the tips of the opposite nymph and this ring is so encased in girls that it can be removed only by filing it or forcibly cutting it with scissors we can imagine those shackles can be welded only by soldering so as to unite the branches of the buckle after it has been sunk into the flesh and this soldering can be performed only with a red hot iron which is laid on the buckle itself in order to melt in the ore lead as to the women they wear there an iron circle provided with a lock the key of which the husband holds for this tool supplies the place of seraglio and eunuchs who require such expense and who cost so dear in asia that absolutely nobody but seigniors and princes have slaves trained for guarding other slaves villains from among the population use those rings we have just spoken about

7981629 ms manning says that her mother was a bona fide purchaser for value of the coins and that she is now the rightful owner of them
7981630 mr algards statements to the west vancouver police are hearsay and are not admissible in evidence if that is the case there is no way for the estate to prove that the coins were lost by or stolen from mr algard and ms mannings claim to the coins must prevail
7981631 mr algards estate says that the coins were lost or stolen in 1994 and that he retained legal title to the coins at all times so that the estate remains the owner of the coins
7981632 i can infer that the fifth coin was lost with the other four coins
7981633 there is simply nothing in the record that permits me to do that ms ovsenek purchased the coin in good faith and without notice of any defect in title the estate has not been able to prove that mr algard had title to the coin

7981637 the general theory being put forth by board gurus is that if you begin with a hook the agent or editor is forced to read about your work to find the information they need this might work but i think those who assume this are taking a great risk faced with hundreds of queries in her inbox if she even takes queries via email many agents will only read a sentence or two before hitting the delete key or giving a standard or form rejection in frustration
7981638 just on a personal note i have never really understood the idea that if a writer has been paid to write something an article in this case that his skills would command monetary compensation in another area of writing lets look at it this way if you were a novelist would that count if you were going to apply to write articles for newsweek

7981711 each of these students would have earned an additional 3 080 per year equating to 136 000 over their lifetime i make it 123 200 for a 40 year working life the total gain to the economy over the period 1989 2007 would have been over 9 billion

7981751 the u s is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in north korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
7981752 visits to facilities review of documents interviews with technical personnel and other measures unanimously agreed upon among the six parties
7981753 the u s however raised all of a sudden an issue of applying an international standard to the verification of the nuclear declaration abusing this agreed point
7981754 it pressured north korea to accept such inspection as scouring any place as it pleases to collect samples and measure them
7981755 the measure is regrettable as it came at a time when the six parties have to make concerted efforts to complete phase two of the denuclearization process

7981771 toen we maandag 26 oktober uit bruinisse weggingen was het schitterend weer
7981772 we lagen stil e n grote bonk ijzer met 900 ton kerosine ineens was er niets meer ik dacht dat kan niet kapitein de ronde is meteen klaarwakker
7981773 mijn eerste angst was dat we zouden zinken zegt hij
7981774 ik heb het schip achteruit getrokken en de afloskapitein gevraagd of we lek waren
7981775 het was noodweer en de radar moest ook naar beneden
7981776 en bij de post brienenoord hadden ze niet gezegd dat de stuw omlaag was
7981777 tolonglah saya jemputan nyanyi dah kering sekarang anak nak kesekolah pun tak ada duit saya nak bagi sob sobs tolonglah saya seniman
7981778 we konden ook weinig maten nemen omdat alles dik in de isolatie zat
7981779 bij het invaren hebben we het schip op hogere blokken gezet
7981780 zodat we na het doorbranden het voorschip met platformwagens konden verrijden en de nieuwe middensectie van elf meter ertussen konden plaatsen
7981781 we houden die ruime marge aan want ombouw kan altijd verrassingen opleveren ook deze keer met de tanks en fundaties
7981782 wij hebben daarom heel veel brandwachten aan boord de eisen zijn bijna strenger dan in de petrochemische industrie

7981800 funny enough throughout the semester i called you you never answered sms also you didnt reply i ingat all this time you have me wrong number sorry pal
7981801 i want you to make the website like this the whole page will resize and change colour every 2 seconds with ever changing theme based on the venus and mars alignment
7981802 sure i can do that if i have the final design of your building
7981803 i havent finalised the designs yet you finalised your website for me first ok
7981804 how can i design something when i have no idea how your building will look like i need to incorporate elements from the building to this website
7981805 just do it its easy lah its not as hard as my design sure you can do for me in two days
7981806 you see this visualisation i did in 3dmax i want you design my building exactly like this
7981807 but this is architecturally unsound you cant have building with just 3 support pillars the building will topple in high wind situation
7981808 you have no vision is it it easy to design what i already gave you my sketch and 3d render you only need to do the floor plan based on my idea what is so hard already came up with the concept that is the hardest part anyway
7981809 do you have any experience in leading a team on your university projects

7981814 apart from the ace programme the range and quality of resources is unsatisfactory books for reading are old and some are in a poor condition resources for independent research are limited and again largely out of date there are very few resources for practical science and design and technology pupils in the youngest abcs learning centre do not have sufficient or appropriate resources for their needs
7981815 some pupils are achieving good standards in their pace work as indicated by the number of times they achieve 100 in their pace tests standards in non ace subjects are more variable and pupils are making insufficient progress in their acquisition of investigative skills in science and design skills in dt
7981816 the ace programme does not provide pupils with the opportunity to learn about english public institutions and services and the school has not sought to compensate for this omission this is a weakness
7981817 the school does not meet requirements for the disability discrimination act as it does not have a current three year action plan to increase disabled access to the school and the curriculum
7981818 provision for the younger pupils is unsatisfactory the learning centre is too small and lacks adequate lighting
7981819 there are no specialist areas or rooms for practical science or design and technology which significantly impedes the teaching of these aspects of the curriculum the outdoor play area is too small for the number of pupils in the school and there is no grassed area for sports
7981820 tony blair opened the door in the debate on faith schools so its time for people like us to strike while the iron is hot
7981821 teaching is satisfactory overall and good in the senior learning centre teachers
7981822 provision for pupils spiritual moral social and cultural development is good pupils behaviour is outstanding and pupils emphatically report there is no bullying in the school
7981823 however the school does make good use of the multicultural nature of the school and church community to develop pupils appreciation of their own and other cultures
7981824 staff show a strong and genuine commitment to pupils welfare the policy for managing behaviour is based on the ace procedures manual and is rooted in the principle that the individual is responsible for his or her actions pupils are very positive about the rewards for good behaviour as well as being well aware of the sanctions for unacceptable behaviour
7981825 the school meets all of the education independent school standards england regulations 2003 as amended january 2005 with the exception of those listed below

7981830 the anarchy and chaos in iraq is linked to the presence of the occupation not withdrawal from iraq
7981831 what we strive for is establishing a balanced relationship between the two countries but nothing of this could be made possible until the troops withdraw from iraq
7981832 iraqis have enough experience in military training and we dont need the us to train us
7981833 the problem with the current iraqi armed forces is not the lack of training but the lack of loyalty to iraq
7981834 all iraqis sunnis and shiites arabs and kurds muslims and christians and others want to live together in one united country
7981835 the vast majority of iraqis will fight to maintain their countrys territorial integrity
7981836 we think that the american people and congress are misinformed about what the iraqis want
7981837 we hope we will have more chances to bring the voices of the majority of iraqis to america

7981850 hey this animation is simple i can do something like this on a few piece of paper
7981851 we verwerken tussen de 400 en 450 schepen in de binnenvaart
7981852 afhankelijk van het weer worden er in de jachtsluis 250 500 schepen geschut veel meer kan niet we zitten aan ons maximum
7981853 nu werk ik net als andere sluiswachters in het waterdistrict haringvliet dat wil zeggen dat we ook ingezet worden op andere sluizen om maar wat te noemen de haringvlietsluis de goereese sluis de biesboschsluis en de wilheminasluis bij andel
7981854 ongeveer 130 meter lang en ik schat een meter of vijftien breed heel veel schepen varen tussen antwerpen en rotterdam dan is het echt minutenwerk ze varen bij wijze van spreken aan de hand van een spoorboekje
7981855 de vlissingen is het grootste schip dat we hier schutten die vervoert stookolie dat schip is zeker 150 meter lang en 23 50 meter breed die past net in de sluis en moet heel langzaam in en uitvaren het water dat normaal via de zijkanten wegstroomt moet dan onder het schip weg heeft ook wel een voordeel je bent het passen en meten kwijt
7981856 van hi rarchie is al lang geen sprake meer we hebben vier werkplekken de ivs werkplek de centrale administratie waar de baas van de dag zit de opvaart en de afvaart door te wisselen van werkplek blijft het aantrekkelijk werken en maak je iedereen gelijk
7981857 als een schip in terneuzen vertrekt en via ons complex reist weten we wat er aankomt lengte breedte lading etc wij zijn een ivs meldpunt en geven dat weer door aan andere sluiscomplexen en meldpunten dat geldt voor passagiersschepen schepen met gevaarlijke stoffen en transportwerk alles wat op noord zuid vaart meldt zich
7981858 stel dat een schip ergens op de waal zand laadt dan moet hij zich tussendoor melden
7981859 het schip heeft dan een soort chip aan boord en zendt de gegevens door dat systeem is nog lang niet ingeburgerd niet ieder schip heeft een dergelijke chip aan boord ongetwijfeld zal er nog veel over gesproken worden want je hebt ook te maken met bescherming van privacy ook dat zal weer opgelost worden toen ivs ingevoerd werd waren er ook veel schippers die bezwaar maakten dat had eveneens te maken met privacy nu is iedereen gewend aan het systeem zoiets heeft tijd nodig
7981860 niet alle schepen mogen zomaar naast elkaar gelegd worden dat heeft te maken met de lading een schip met gevaarlijke stoffen en een passagiersschip mogen nooit in dezelfde sluis liggen ten strengste verboden
7981861 overdag loopt er iemand over de muur en bedient de sluis ter plekke dat heeft zeker in het seizoen te maken met de drukte dan is het beter dat er een mannetje loopt hij kan dan veel gemakkelijker probleempjes die er af en toe zijn oplossen s avonds wordt de jachtsluis vanuit de centrale bediend buiten het seizoen wordt die sluis ook wel ingezet voor de beroepsvaart daar is menig sluiswachter in nederland jaloers op die sluis is ook 145 meter lang en 16 meter breed mooi om die sluis achter de hand te hebben
7981862 na de renovatie zal de brug vanuit het nieuwe gebouw bediend worden alle bedieningen van de verschillende objecten bij elkaar in n ruimte wel zo gemakkelijk we hebben hier ook nog een knoppenpaneel waarmee we de inlaatsluizen bedienen daarmee kunnen we als het nodig is water spuien in het volkerak zoommeer

7981864 facevo questi film impegnati che si vedevano ai festival e poi sparivano ero diventata un attrice d autore una di quelle che vengono sempre considerate bruttine ma intense poi arrivato nanni loy ho fatto testa o croce e sono diventata improvvisamente bella e prosperosa
7981865 nessuno al massimo qualche dolcetto che mi ha fatto ingrassare di un paio di chili
7981866 ci andai per promuovere proprio testa o croce era natale e riuscii giusto a balbettare auguri a sandro pertini
7981867 beh s qualcosa successo e pensare che l estate scorsa avevo deciso di mollare tutto ero reduce dal cantagiro mi sarei voluta chiudere in un monastero pensavo che era meglio lasciar perdere e fare una vita da signora vivere in questa casa seguire renzo nei suoi viaggi ho avuto grandi delusioni nella mia carriera e non vero che essere la compagna di arbore mi ha aiutata anzi spesso non sono andata a bussare alle porte dei direttori per evitare che qualcuno potesse pensare che mi facessero lavorare per ingraziarsi renzo la prova che ho fatto anche cose molto mediocri ad una rotonda sul mare tiravo fuori palle da un bussolotto
7981868 l avventura cominciata con un intervista in cui giurato diceva che avrebbe voluto lavorare con me poi mi chiam don mazzi avevano saputo che non potevo farla perch ero incinta no non possibile dissi sar una voce messa in giro per farmi fuori e lui ma come non credi a me che sono un prete comunque il programma partito malissimo con quell idea dell aeroporto all inizio sembrava di stare a beirut io non avevo il ruolo della padrona di casa poi forse piaciuto questo mio modo d essere
7981869 semplice allegra vitale me stessa fino in fondo e poi sono diventata il simbolo di quella che pi lavora e meno guadagna per domenica in mi danno 4 milioni lordi a puntata mi ha incontrata una funzionaria dell ufficio scritture e mi ha detto grazie signora venier io la cito sempre come riferimento nelle trattative

7981878 k nnen sie mit bitte sagen ob ich mit dieser s ge kleinere holzarbeiten gut machen kann
7981879 ah ja dankesch n ich kam mir schon ein bisschen unwissend vor aber so ist das halt wenn man sich mit etwas noch nie besch ftigt hat ich lachte innerlich sehr ber mich und hatte viel spa im baumarkt zuhause angekommen versuchte ich meine pl ne in die tat umzusetzen und es war schwerer als gedacht erst war ich ganz bei der sache und sehr konzentriert umso mehr zeit verging umso mehr kreisten meine gedanken zu anderen themen und ich war wieder ganz woanders vor allem am nachmittag falle ich immer in den gleichen gedankenzwang es ist total l cherlich und ich habe das jetzt schon fter beobachtet nachmittag bedeutet tr umen f r mich aus dem tr umen werden bilder und vorstellungen die sich dann so schnell wie m glich erf llen m ssen am fr hen abend kommt dann eine unruhe auf da sich meine vorstellungen nat rlich nicht erf llen denn die sind ja nur in meinem kopf haha also zeit f r selbstmitleid und frustration danach
7981880 as we have pointed out right from the start we would be facing a tough challenge
7981881 we are prepared to make the necessary changes to regain public confidence in the bn
7981882 its still too early to state the factors for our loss
7981883 although we lost the bn will fulfill its pledges to the people of permatang pauh
7981884 generally it was good but we will study the matter in greater detail
7981885 we dap never doubt that anwar would win i feel the people in barisan nasional bn thinks that he anwar will get lesser votes then his wife
7981886 elle sappelle karin elle est tr s gentille et tr s intelligente et elle cherche un homme
7981887 to suggest that because he and his wife own four homes that they use for their personal living quarters that somehow means hes detached from america is simply wrong and i think offensive i just dont think the politics of envy end up being successful in the final analysis
7981888 thats a good question and it should be a simple one
7981889 obviously the war is a very important issue to me we need to get our troops home and we need to get them home now my own personal feelings about it is when the world is kind of perfect and we have those two things when were at peace and everybody has a good job although we should be working on these at the same time i dont mean to imply otherwise im really a big advocate for health care and of course my heart lies with education
7981890 i was kind of afraid of obama the first time i saw him
7981891 i think that not only can barack cause change because thats where his heart lies as a true american success story he understands how hard it is
7981892 he inspires us to be the best americans we can be and i think if hes president when hes president i should say were going to find people changing on the inside and once we all have hope for the future i think youre going to find everyones going to wake up and take control of this amazing moment where theres so many things that need help and people will all be inspired to help
7981893 i think the entertainment industry has all good intentions when we try to come out the thing that is unfortunate is that some of us who are maybe a little recognizable weve got to come out as private citizens and support our country in any way that we can
7981894 theres a media spin on it that were all out of touch how could we possibly have an awareness of what real americans feel and think and need because we just ride around in limos and i dont know buy diamonds all day long thats kind of the perception but i dont know anyone like that im certainly not like that im a passionate american and thats what i am first and foremost
7981895 shove them under and let me work i am the grass i cover all
7981896 if he brings you to it hell bring you through it
7981897 only to the extent that we expose ourselves over and over to annihilation can that which is indestructible be found in us

7981909 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
7981910 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
7981911 l unico problema era amalgamare tutti sembra che ci siamo riusciti
7981912 renzo mi ha consigliato solo di mettere dentro il programma tutta me stessa di non nascondere il mio carattere e io ero d accordo in tv si vede se sei sincera il pubblico premia chi se stesso
7981913 questa una scelta che toglie sette mesi alla mia vita privata ma credo che professionalmente domenica in sia un punto d arrivo ho dovuto dire no ad un film con mastroianni e nanni loy per condurre questo show sono contenta di tornare in tv con un programma importante come questo negli ultimi tempi ero un po affaticata io sono passata attraverso la trasgressione di candid camera ed ho fatto l estenuante cantagiro
7981914 parece que basta con afirmarlo para que los ac litos lo crean a pies juntillas pues no se ores al menos lo que ustedes argumentan en esa p gina no es ciencia sino pura magia y fantas a
7981915 la medicina tradicional no cura el c ncer porque solo trata los s ntomas nosotros tratamos s ntomas y causas
7981916 al hombre como un ser total e integral sin tener en cuenta que se trata de una unidad bio psico espiritual quien puede sufrir tanto de uno como de otro plano
7981917 1 la similitud entre una sustancia y el cuadro a tratar determinadas sustancias utilizadas en dosis ponderables provocan s ntomas en una persona sana mientras que utilizadas en dosis muy bajas o infinitesimales pueden curar estos s ntomas en una persona enferma bueno s esto puede valer para algunas enfermedades infecciosas y es la base de las vacunas pero si me intoxico con mercurio debo tomar mercurio infinitesimal y si tengo diabetes que tomo p ncreas no funcional diluido lo que ya me aclar un colega el otro d a es que si tengo acidez de est mago en lugar de bicarbonato que es lo contrario debo ingerir cido de bater a que es lo similar gracias a ello mis digestiones son cada vez mejores hablando en serio no hay demostraci n alguna que apoye que una intoxicaci n con plomo mejore administrando plomo en peque as cantidades todos los experimentos y pruebas de que disponemos indican que el plomo seguir deposit ndose y por lo tanto prolongando la intoxicaci n por poca cantidad que administremos la individualizaci n del tratamiento la homeopat a se caracteriza tambi n por la individualizaci n del tratamiento ello significa que para un cl nico home pata no hay enfermedades sino enfermos el m todo homeop tico necesita conocer todos los s ntomas del paciente tanto los relacionados directamente a su enfermedad como los que indican su reacci n individual ante esa misma enfermedad
7981918 por supuesto que son menos t xicas dado que seg n demuestra la qu mica m s elemental la mayor parte de las diluciones homeop ticas son nicamente agua o el disolvente que se utilice las energ as misteriosas y memorias indemostrables intoxicar intoxican poco que es lo mismo que se repite unos p rrafos m s abajo cuando es capaz de provocar sobre un individuo sano y sensible un conjunto de s ntomas caracter sticos y propios de dicho remedio y de curar a un individuo enfermo quien tenga los mismos s ntomas que las que provoca sobre el individuo sano por lo tanto en el primer caso se trata de inducir al organismo a una enfermedad de tipo artificial por lo contrario en el segundo se trata de curar una enfermedad natural del individuo
7981919 cuando se estudian los medicamentos a dar se establece una experiencia cient fica en tal sentido los efectos son capaces de ser repetidos una y otra vez experimentando en voluntarios sanos
7981920 el medicamento homeop tico contiene la informaci n necesaria y suficiente para que una persona retome el equilibrio perdido esa informaci n coincide con la informaci n desviada a ser tratada enfermedad por el principio de la similitud y de dicha coincidencia surge el efecto la curaci n
7981921 informaci n del medicamento la conocemos como informaci n celular cuyo mejor ejemplo es el material gen tico
7981922 la energ a emitida por la part cula homeop tica ha demostrado gran potencia en las fotograf as kirlian su radio de acci n es mayor que la emitida por una part cula farmacol gica del mismo producto
7981923 por supuesto la pr ctica totalidad de ellos en revistas homeop ticas o de medicinas alternativas

7982199 the bankruptcy bill is morally bankrupt and so is any senator who votes for it
7982200 so what does the bill do it makes it harder for average people to file for bankruptcy protection it makes it easier for landlords to evict a bankrupt tenant it endangers child support payments by giving a wider array of creditors a shot at post bankruptcy income it allows millionaires to shield an unlimited amount of equity in homes and asset protection trusts it makes it more difficult for small businesses to reorganize while opening new loopholes for the enrons of the world it allows creditors to provide misleading information and it does nothing to rein in lending abuses
7982201 people that vote decide nothing people who count the votes decide everything

7982238 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7982239 a lesson learned about what the american peoples priorities are and their priority is to secure the borders
7982240 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7982241 i was really concerned at first because i thought it could be corrosive or dangerous
7982242 the only way i can describe it is white rain it looked like someone had thrown a flour bomb but on closer inspection it was definitely a strange kind of residue
7982243 you can see it everywhere its all over the cars in the street and it has covered our clothes washing
7982244 ive lived here for most of my life and ive never seen anything like it before i think it might be some kind of pollution from local industry
7982245 i honestly cant explain it we have had some localised examples of this kind of thing in the past but i wouldnt like to say what caused this
7982246 if people are concerned then its something that needs to be looked into
7982247 it started in early august we found yellow spots all over our washing that had been drying on the line and they would not come off
7982248 there were also yellow spots all over our window sill which are still there as they have burnt into the pvc and yellow spots all over a lot of the cars in the street
7982249 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7982250 we are trying to find out who is actually behind this it is nothing to do with change in politics
7982251 the change in the presidency has come about for the first time in pakistan in a peaceful process
7982252 the constitution has been followed the president has resigned of his own accord it has been absolutely according to the book
7982253 they proclaim themselves a so called organization and they call themselves the tahrik e taliban and we dont know how many people are there

7982258 it seems like non melanoma skin cancer even though it is a non fatal disease may be a for increased risk of other more serious cancers
7982259 it is far and away the most common form of cancer
7982260 people with a personal history of non melanoma skin cancer were two times more likely to develop a subsequent cancer compared to people without a personal history of non melanoma skin cancer
7982261 the results were pretty clear in showing the earlier the age of developing non melanoma skin cancer the higher the increased risk for subsequent malignancies
7982262 if they are less adept at that their risk for skin cancer increases

7982273 going the extra mile for our customers when it comes to providing them with convenience
7982274 when we began planning ie8 we took a hard look at our customers concerns about privacy on the web
7982275 as evidenced by some of the comments on this blog during the ie7 days many users are concerned about so called over the shoulder privacy or the ability to control what their spouses friends kids and co workers might see
7982276 while you browse the web your ie keeps a local record of which third party items your browser accesses and where they were accessed from
7982277 inprivate blocking keeps a record of third party items like the one above as you browse when you choose to browse with inprivate ie automatically blocks sites that have seen you across more than 10 sites

7982279 we are very satisfied with the results in our third fiscal quarter which established another record quarterly net income milestone for the company
7982280 however due to the strengthening of the u s dollar and the difficult economic environment in the u s and europe achieving our future goals will become more challenging
7982281 there is nothing that i would do that is unethical

7982284 the pumas the holdouts and the majority apparently of sen hillary clinton people who really want sen barack obama and the democratic party to win this november
7982285 i kind of think were hyping it up a little bit
7982286 despite todds criticism in august 25 interviews with house speaker nancy pelosi sen charles schumer president jimmy carter and robert gibbs 18 of the 20 questions nbc and msnbc correspondents and anchors asked dealt with clinton her supporters or former president bill clinton
7982287 the the holdouts and the majority apparently of sen hillary clinton people who really want sen barack obama and the democratic party to win this november
7982288 i kind of think were hyping it up a little bit
7982289 notwithstanding todds comments during msnbcs august 25 coverage of the democratic national convention in interviews with house speaker nancy pelosi d ca sen
7982290 savannah guthrie there with chuck schumer the senator from new york talking up hillarys role in this of course it is going to be the story of the week no matter what we say will the clintons get aboard will they be invited aboard with all the right protocols
7982291 why did we waste all of our time with that
7982292 should senator clinton have called on her supporters to back barack obama already
7982293 h as she clinton hurt barack obama given what the polls are looking like why not
7982294 i ts three months until the election madame speaker and what we have is you talked about 20 percent there are a lot of disgruntled some of them actually angry supporters of hillary clinton
7982295 what do you say to hillary supporters who are now being wooed by john mccain
7982296 hillary speaks tomorrow night president clinton speaks on wednesday night what do the clintons want and what role do you think they the clintons will play
7982297 i have to ask you first of all about that other senator from new york a lot has been said and written about lingering division in the party do you see that in your delegation
7982298 is there some aspect to this that hillary herself has not been able to control i mean there are people who clearly feel strongly about it and no matter what her signals are want to make a stand
7982299 what do you think her role in the senate will be now is she going to be the lioness of the senate in the mold of ted kennedy
7982300 do you think that she hillary clinton should have thrown her support and asked her supporters to go to obama before now
7982301 have you spoken to the clintons have you asked them to have a certain kind of message in other words have you tried to guide what theyre going to do here
7982302 h ave you called to talk to them about what they need to do here
7982303 when are we going to see a real coming together of bill clinton the former president and the democratic nominee for president barack obama when will we see them in the same picture together having lunch together hanging out together in a friendly environment when will that happen
7982304 i havent seen a picture yet of bill clinton with barack obama when will i see them together
7982305 mr gibbs whats the best case scenario what do you see as the best case scenario of these conversations if we dont call them negotiations between you and those supporters sort of running whats left of the clinton campaign as we wait for the kennedy thing tonight
7982306 do you expect bill clinton to barnstorm his way through those areas where he did well southern white guys if you will in the appalachian area states that can be tricky portions of ohio portions of pennsylvania are you going to really surgically use bill the way for example eddie rendell the governor of pennsylvania was able to call in air strikes by the clintons
7982307 why did we waste all of our time with that
7982308 ok we will support gerald ford as a last choice
7982309 ill get back to you ill get some staff to get you that answer

7982311 back to the future jurassic park close encounters and terminator 2
7982312 we were emulating the style of movie from the old amblin days like back to the future and gremlins which if you watch today are still very funny also the cartoon itself was quite funny also comedy makes things more accessible to a larger audience
7982313 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men
7982314 military operations lasted several hours during which airstrikes were called in the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some 7 8 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others local residents were able to confirm the number of casualties including names age and gender of the victims
7982315 the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
7982316 may compromise the integrity of these education programs for practicing physicians
7982317 under the present system in many circumstances a cme course will be held only if a commercial company is willing to sponsor it
7982318 while for profit enterprises may occasionally engage in philanthropy it should not be surprising that the core motivation of pharmaceutical and medical device industries in supporting cme is to market their products and services
7982319 this leads to a cme curriculum which is at least in part designed to address market needs rather than being entirely focused upon improving performance of practicing physicians
7982320 clearly it would be preferable for stanford faculty to design our cme curriculum solely based upon the needs of our learners as they seek to address the health care needs of their patients
7982321 these people are considered dangerous and could possibly be armed so we are asking the public please do not approach them
7982322 well have to look at the entire communications process in light of this escape

7982324 i look forward to the investigation to find out exactly what happened in this case
7982325 well have to look at the entire communications process in light of this escape
7982326 in the future well release to the media at the same time we release to the rcmp to ensure that public safety is maintained
7982327 these people are considered dangerous and could possibly be armed so we are asking the public please do not approach them
7982328 i look forward to the investigation to find out exactly what happened in this case
7982329 theres been an upsurge in ascii spam in the last week its quite effective in getting through filters
7982330 the downside is that nine times out of ten its completely useless because its almost impossible to read or its a really bizarre picture of a naked lady thats not clickable
7982331 we expect spammers to use every means possible to try to send spam thats why we have a very robust spam fighting effort at google

7982333 theyve got this great idea for getting past the servers but they dont seem to know how to employ it as effectively as they could

7982349 theres a whole lot more to the african american community than entertainment and sports
7982350 the african american community is i think news starved and underserved
7982351 i saw some data that said when you looked at the top 10 tv shows in the white community and you looked at the top 10 tv shows in the black community none overlapped with the exception of er which was number one in the white community and number 10 in the black community so i started asking questions why there was a time when we all got our language and we got our culture fed through three tv networks today its totally different and people i think receive the news and they want to hear the news in ways that they want to listen to it none of the mainstream news sources target the african american community in ways that they actually want to listen
7982352 whatever obama is doing its news if he becomes president then that surely would provide a lot of content but i think news is more than presidential elections or the war in iraq

7982395 if they want relations to worsen they will get it
7982396 in this situation the ball is in the europeans court
7982397 if they want relations to worsen they will get it
7982398 but if they want to save a strategic relationship which is absolutely in the interest of both russia and europe everything will be fine
7982399 this is contrary to the principles of the independence the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia
7982400 examine from this point of view the consequences of russias decision
7982401 i hope that our european partners will understand how to separate the wheat from the chaff and that we will be able to build normal and fruitful future relations
7982402 i think that georgia should be a normal state completely separate as regards its sovereignty it is of course a complex question one that will ultimately be determined by its relations with its neighbours
7982403 georgia must learn lessons from what has happened its a serious lesson one about how to construct relations with your close neighbours and with people who once were part of georgia

7982411 for the avoidance of doubt the only person who can officially open parliament will be determined by the outcome of the ongoing dialogue
7982412 we will not attend we dont expect any member of the executive to address us until that dialogue has been concluded
7982413 this match is going to help me because it was so challenging
7982414 i was missing a lot of match practice so i got a tough one
7982415 the last game i had a couple of mishits but i tried to stay strong concentrate on each point and forget what happened i am so happy i managed to do that
7982416 it was a little bit windy outside so i am happy i could play two sets and win my match
7982417 safina has done a great job she is playing really well and she has lots of confidence

7982419 tonight when hillary clinton speaks she will be an articulate voice for the working men and women the middle class families that have been squeezed and she will make the case as she uniquely can for why barack obama is the right choice for the presidency
7982420 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7982421 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7982422 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7982423 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and me our country will be committed to his cause
7982424 the work will begin anew the hope will rise again and the dream lives on
7982425 i thank god who has been with me through this gruelling election process i thank the voters
7982426 the message is clear we have made a demand for change for freedom and for justice
7982427 the people do not want to be exploited we want an economic order that protects all the people
7982428 yes of course we have lost we were the underdogs going into this race
7982429 this is a clear indication that people of all races have rejected the communal politics of barisan nasional it is a clear endorsement of our reform agenda we are on track to take over the government
7982430 i have spent days and nights thinking about why i said what i did in front of the sec on may 25 2007
7982431 my statement before the sec was completely out of character for me i have tried to live my life in a way that showed that hard work and honesty were their own reward
7982432 the number of people without health insurance coverage decreased to 45 7 million people in 2007
7982433 generally what the report shows is that there has been some change but its pretty minor
7982434 this isnt progress the changes are insignificant and we would need to see this happen for 10 years to say there has been progress
7982435 you have to remember that the numbers in the report are from last year this year americans have been faced with record high petrol prices and rising food prices unemployment is also up meaning fewer americans have access to employer health benefits
7982436 in 2006 the number of poor elderly people would be higher by 12 6 million people if social security payments were excluded from money income more than quadrupling the number of poor elderly
7982437 this was an endlessly fascinating process already and its still got some twists and turns between now and november
7982438 but underneath that and in the background there is also a different story which we dont want to unearth much on the convention floor because its not really what were trying to do but which you should be mindful of
7982439 it seems to me everyone in the world should be obsessed with this

7982442 gustav continues to represent a potential threat to oil and gas installations in the gulf region and will be watched with vigilance
7982443 given the current track for gustav and the expectation that it might enter the gulf of mexico this weekend we are making logistical arrangements to evacuate staff who are not essential to production or drilling operations
7982444 evacuations could begin as early as tomorrow there is no impact on production at this time
7982445 in the face of the danger threatening haiti i ask national civil protection committees and our friends in international cooperation to help the government manage the risks and disasters
7982446 after 20 minutes the pilot called nyala airport to tell him the plane had been hijacked and that he is en route to tripoli in libya
7982447 i am worried about my father and mother they are coming from nyala on this flight no one has any information about the situation they are in
7982448 this is the result of what the government is doing in the camps of displaced people in nyala
7982449 im not sure if its connected to kalma but its related to that the government kills and the international community does not intervene what can the darfurian people do

7982459 es indudable que la necesidad es sin nimo de urgencias de apuros en todo sentido por ese motivo tal vez no hay paciencia no hay para nada objetividad en los juicios ni criterio para tomar decisiones y se pasa de h roe a villano con gran facilidad no hay el m nimo respeto por la figura del entrenador no se tiene la madurez ni el equilibrio para salir adelante en situaciones dif ciles adversas

7982469 its totally false and im sure it will all come out that way
7982470 its a shame that we have a system in which someone can make these kinds of claims without any proof
7982471 they had information that an employee jan hoeft had been using a company credit card for unauthorized purchases
7982472 it is alleged she used the card for personal items
7982473 good food and lots of it for only seven bucks
7982474 thats right and i deserve it cuz im a cranky old man
7982475 well lets just take a look at the origin of the word
7982476 we are working with fema to get to the bottom of it
7982477 in this case its sort of embarrassing that it happened to fema themselves fema being a child of dhs with calls going to the middle east
7982478 this illegal activity enables unauthorized individuals anywhere in the world to communicate via compromised u s phone systems in a way that is difficult to trace
7982479 the model of the marshall plan can be of great help for example a global marshall plan must focus on strategic goals and emphasize actions and programs that are likely to remove the bottlenecks presently inhibiting the healthy functioning of the global economy the new global economy must be an inclusive system that does not leave entire regions behind the new plan will require the wealthy nations to allocate money for transferring environmentally helpful technologies to the third world and to help impoverished nations achieve a stable population and a new pattern of sustainable economic progress to work however any such effort will also require wealthy nations to make a transition themselves that will be in some ways more wrenching than that of the third world
7982480 it does and i put it this way we believe that investment in our own intellectual properties as particularly phil harrison and i tried to do in the last five years with singstar or with the getaway or with buzz these are ours we can put them in our cupboard
7982481 we have to accept more and more that platform holders themselves cannot have exclusives unless theyre given millions and millions of dollars not to develop a particular game for one particular platform
7982482 but for developers and you could take someone like quantic dream for example a great game it takes a lot of time to develop they need a little bit of funding external development in exchange its exclusive that works so exclusivity possibly with developers is more likely that exclusivity with publishers
7982483 shuhei yoshida president of sony worldwide studios can tell you what else is coming out maybe hes told you already but there are certainly from japan going to be some really really good stuff both on playstation portable and playstation 3

7982486 in his serious vein mr dylan seems to be performing in a slow motion film elasticized phrases are drawn out until you think they may snap mr dylans highly personalized approach toward folk song is still evolving he has been sopping up influences like a sponge at times the drama he aims at is off target melodrama and his stylization threatens to topple over as a mannered excess

7982493 maar het is niet altijd even makkelijk aan een wedstrijd te beginnen als je al 2 0 voor staat
7982494 we hebben goed werk verricht bij twente maar de klus is nog niet geklaard we moeten respect hebben voor twente en de wedstrijd ingaan met de wil om te winnen
7982495 ik vind dat we een sterk team hebben en ik geloof in de spelers die we al hebben e n speler maakt niet het verschil je moet als team karakter tonen
7982496 in arnhem is gebleken dat je de eerste goal moet scoren om kans te maken op de overwinning woensdag zullen we dus gaan voor die eerste treffer we starten weer op 0 0
7982497 ik denk dat we arsenal met name in de eerste helft verrast hebben en een hoog niveau hebben gespeeld na afloop realiseerden de spelers dat ze een kans hadden arsenal te verslaan en om meer uit die wedstrijd te halen de teleurstelling overheerste toen uiteraard
7982498 het is voor jonge spelers een fantastische ervaring hier wordt iedere speler beter van we moeten er van genieten
7982499 de afwezigheid van wilkshire en arnautovic is een probleem dat we moeten zien op te lossen kansloos zijn we tegen arsenal echter niet
7982500 this is great for the cities of dallas and philadelphia as well find out who the true culinary champions will be

7982502 will no longer accept support from pharmaceutical or device companies for specific programs in continuing medical education as industry directed funding may compromise the integrity of these education programs for practicing physicians
7982503 while for profit enterprises may occasionally engage in philanthropy it should not be surprising that the core motivation of pharmaceutical and medical device industries in supporting cme is to market their products and services this leads to a cme curriculum which is at least in part designed to address market needs rather than being entirely focused upon improving performance of practicing physicians
7982504 rather than organizing symposia at hotels or resorts stanfords offerings which draw physicians from around the world will try to make use of campus facilities

7982539 it was one fourth the game and one fourth the team
7982540 we didnt have time to set up all the weapons
7982541 we thought a 3 hour game that is around 2 or 3 gigs would be a reasonable size
7982542 we were very conscious of the download size of the game at the beginning of production
7982543 considering that hd movies are around 4 5 gigs and short game demos are between 1 and 2 gigs we thought a 3 hour game that is around 2 or 3 gigs would be a reasonable size
7982544 i think about a year ago there was so much buzz in the development community about episodic and short form game development that its not a surprise
7982545 thats an exciting feeling to go into uncharted waters and try new types of games
7982546 something wed certainly apply to future adventures big or small

7982561 weve got to define mccain and youve got to deal with bush and the bush record of nonperformance
7982562 four years ago john kerry had this crazy notion that you dont have to fight back in an election
7982563 youd have thought bush was the war hero with the way they spun that contest look elections are about contrasts and i want to start seeing some of that soon
7982564 you know theyre going to be jumping all over obama now thats an attack that we want to stop right here
7982565 my dad grew up in the same congressional district as kennedy only on the other side of the tracks
7982566 my dad and jfk would attend mass together on the campaign trail and my dad would always provide money for the collection plate because apparently jfk wasnt in the habit of carrying cash
7982567 he loved john f kennedy but he used to joke that jfk owed him money from those campaign trail appearances in church

7982577 georgian president mikheil saakashvili chose genocide to solve his political tasks
7982578 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have more than once spoken in referenda supporting the independence of their republics we understand that after what had happened they have the right to decide their fate themselves
7982579 this decision is completely illegal and has no legal basis
7982580 as far as involvement in other conflicts is concerned we naturally are not going to do this
7982581 but russia is a state which has to ensure its interests along the whole length of its border this is absolutely clear
7982582 it the eu calls for a political solution to the conflicts in georgia it will examine the consequences of russias decision from this point of view
7982583 nothing scares us including the prospect of a cold war but we dont want it
7982584 in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
7982585 we feel happy we all have tears in our eyes we feel pride for our people
7982586 one more step towards the self isolation of the russian federation from the international community
7982587 doctors orders to rest his voice as he has been diagnosed with acute laryngitis

7982589 not really it was more like an anticlimactic august night that a lot of people who paid a lot of money to witness will try to forget

7982591 we are now hit by four globally generated shockwaves including financial shock triggering a global slowdown the oil and commodity including food price shocks that have exacerbated the financial shock the resulting inflation shock and the coming stagflation shock
7982592 we face much greater economic and financial uncertainity our stock markets have lost 40 per cent of their value in just six months and no one knows when we will get back to january 2008 levels
7982593 we need to move further and faster with reforms not just in our economy but in our society our political system and judiciary
7982594 we also need to decide more clearly what role the state should play in our economy and our society
7982595 events in jammu and kashmir remind us that we are at increasing risk of losing control over the centrifugal and centripetal political forces that are continually bearing down upon us
7982596 we need to rethink our approach and strategy to facilitate the emergence of india as a major economic and strategic player on the global stage

7982621 john adler and his cronies in trenton and washington have stooped to a shameful new low today by doctoring my photo and lying about my position on the issue of iraq reconstruction aid in an attempt to mislead voters and divert attention away from mr adlers deplorable tax and spend record as a 16 year career trenton politician
7982622 my eight year old daughter would know better than to doctor someones photo and try to pass it off as the real thing

7982671 wts is a direct tribute to the early 90s elektra records
7982672 at that time elektra records was signing acts like pete rock and cl smooth brand nubian and launched the whole era of conscious thought provoking music that made it cool to be an intellectual it was the emergence of hip hop as a culture that young people could embrace and relate to

7982674 carlos helped me connect with a lot of elders in the la jazz scene like dwight trible and derf recklaw

7982676 carlos has a separate history and catalogue and discography and people recognize that where we go and bring it together in a way that doesnt happen in the us
7982677 we recorded the album on both coasts between each of our other projects
7982678 he nino would fly to new york when he could or i would shoot to la to record there
7982679 we stand here before you as students of the same conscious movement that birthed the likes of afrika bambaataa krs one rakim public enemy brand nubian x clan poor righteous teachers kmd and countless others that brought forth an entire essence that took the world by storm and made it cool to be intelligent

7982690 we firmly believe that these concession programs unlawfully re regulate the port trucking industry to the detriment of motor carriers shippers and the businesses and consumers that depend on the products that are handled at those ports
7982691 they are both doing essentially the same thing which is to regulate the trucking industry under the guise of environmental issues
7982692 if this is allowed to go full force you will see large and mid sized trucking companies take advantage and succeed under the program while many of the smaller trucking companies will leave the industry effectively changing how we get goods to market
7982693 we are committed to rolling ahead with the worlds most ambitious and bold plan to simultaneously green and grow a port
7982694 when thousands of lives are cut short every year by toxic emissions from the port we have a moral mandate to act
7982695 the health of our environment and the public is at stake and it is time to hit the brakes on the 16 000 dirty diesel spewing trucks polluting our air every day
7982696 most of us feel helpless since we dont have the funds to fight against the ports and the cities so im glad to see somebody stepping up to the plate
7982697 were all scared because it feels like were getting bullied
7982698 now i know what it feels like to have the mob visit my shop and demand money to join their club
7982699 that requirement which has nothing to do with the clean air goals of the ports clean trucks program threatens a well established trucking industry operational practice that provides efficiencies and the flexibility needed for the trucking industry to effectively serve our customers
7982700 we strongly believe that our plan is lawful and we will vigorously oppose any action that will delay cleaning up the air so that angelenos can begin to breathe easier
7982701 the clean trucks program achieves the ports and the city of los angeles business objectives and is well within their rights as a landowner
7982702 the law has always recognized that a landowner can control the activities that occur on its property and in fact has an obligation to mitigate the impact of those activities
7982703 we have worked closely with the trucking and shipping industries to develop a workable program
7982704 it is disappointing that the ata is seeking to impede this critical air quality initiative
7982705 despite this litigation we are still moving full speed ahead toward our goal of reducing pollution from the truck fleet by 80 percent by 2012
7982706 i believe this practice to be highly unethical i do not care what you do with your money i do care what you do with my name
7982707 russia today took a significant and negative step in recognizing the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia two separatist georgian provinces
7982708 in april i warned that russia was pursuing a policy of de facto annexation that threatened to undermine security and stability in the region todays decision the culmination of a long effort aimed at splitting these two regions away from georgia represents a major step forward in that process moscows action deserves condemnation from the entire international community and russia must understand that its violations of international law carry consequences

7982724 the next president must bring to office a clear eyed view of our nations role in the world as the defender of the oppressed and a force for peace
7982725 in the end confusion about such questions only invites more trouble violence and aggression
7982726 now i missed a few years of the cold war as a guest of one of our adversaries but as i recall the world was deeply divided during the cold war between the side of freedom and the side of tyranny
7982727 the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
7982728 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
7982729 if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright

7982737 our experience tells us theres lots of diversity among the cobbles
7982738 we want to get a better characterization of them a statistical sampling from examining more of them will be important for understanding the geology of the area
7982739 the patterns broadly resemble what we saw at the smaller craters opportunity explored earlier
7982740 by looking deeper into the layering we are looking farther back in time
7982741 if opportunity were driving with only five wheels like spirit it probably would never get out of victoria crater
7982742 we also know from experience with spirit that if opportunity were to lose the use of a wheel after it is out on the level ground mobility should not be a problem

7982744 every fighter will tell you that their next fight is the most important and that wont change here
7982745 fighters can make or break their careers with a few good or bad fights so im not going to let any fight slip by
7982746 i had all the upper tier fighters on his plateau and i thought that i was far off getting a big win like that let me know that i could compete at that level
7982747 the ultimate fighter was great for me because it put me on television in front of everyone
7982748 on the local level mma shows are filled by fighters selling tickets to their friends
7982749 you always try to have a worst case scenario opponent in mind while training and bj is just that

7982760 there is now a perfect overlap between zones of high risk and regions of high opium cultivation
7982761 since drugs are funding insurgency and insurgency enables drug cultivation insurgency and narcotics must be fought together

7982767 if you look at the year over year numbers they are still going down but not accelerating to the downside quite as much as they had been in a number of cities
7982768 if the economy gets weaker this stability we see in housing will give way and well get traditionally weakness in housing that will come from the economy itself so we have to be concerned about that
7982769 the data today paint a mixed picture but its clear it will still take some time to work through the downturn in housing
7982770 once housing prices stabilize that will signal a return to a housing industry that can contribute to economic growth
7982771 i anticipate seeing price support probably sometime in the first or second quarter of next year when the foreclosure market stabilizes back to more normal numbers

7982776 it seems like non melanoma skin cancer even though it is a non fatal disease may be a warning sign for increased risk of other more serious cancers
7982777 it is far and away the most common form of cancer
7982778 people with a personal history of non melanoma skin cancer were two times more likely to develop a subsequent cancer compared to people without a personal history of non melanoma skin cancer
7982779 the results were pretty clear in showing the earlier the age of developing non melanoma skin cancer the higher the increased risk for subsequent malignancies
7982780 if they are less adept at that their risk for skin cancer increases

7982786 we did this map in a very brief period of time just in a matter of days
7982787 the previous experiment egret nasas energetic gamma ray experiment telescope took more than a year to make an equivalent map that holds a tremendous amount of promise for things to come
7982788 none of us could have actually have asked for such a smooth turn on it went like clockwork where we were actually ahead of the clock

7982796 im a morning porn peruser and not for the titillation factor i just find it interesting
7982797 ill go read google news ill go read guardian uk go read our web site and then if ive got nothing else i will just peruse the porn sites because its an ever expanding world
7982798 just when you see the most outlandish clip you could ever see somebody introduces something new i just check in periodically just to see how far porn has gone in my absence
7982799 it turns some people off but thats how mostly everybody i know speaks
7982800 its kind of strange whenever somebody goes that offends me im like wow what kind of weird opposite bizarro frame of mind do you live in cursing is just so second nature you dont even think of it as cursing any more its just your lexicon
7982801 basically its a dressed up version of making your first film it just happens to be a porn film
7982802 if youre turned on by this then we didnt do our job very well
7982803 that kind of gave him a spark for the films
7982804 hes one of those filmmakers who wants to be a musician and i think that the way his films are trying to capture little fresh moments is a cool approach
7982805 its very important to me to not let the musician try to make the song perfect
7982806 its so much more human when a musician is doing this beautiful version of a song but messes up and then continues yeah thats beautiful to me
7982807 as far as the modern world is concerned these are natural environments
7982808 its filmed in its own elements from where it came from the streets and the bars and peoples apartments
7982809 lets put the final nail in the coffin on the term music video and allow it to be something of the past because thats exactly what it is
7982810 it served its purpose very well in the 1980s and 1990s music videos time came and went
7982811 i dont think music or film has been in a more exciting place in 20 years
7982812 i was just blown away by their beauty and how raw they were
7982813 we were just getting a little bit bored of watching the music promos
7982814 we didnt have much clout or really any money so the idea was to try to find a way to get our vision out there and get people to buy into it
7982815 its just one person with a guitar and a couple people banging on parking signs or whatever to try to make a song
7982816 now that the technology is here we hope to finally do it the way that people who really care about music have always wanted to see it done
7982817 if they dont do it then theyve got someone who is hired to do it with clint and i we had someone who was hired to do it but the personal side of it doesnt go away

7982826 barack obama is handsome hes incredibly bright hes incredibly well spoken and hes incredibly successful not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
7982827 what i think most people are waiting for and as soon as they see it i think its over theyre waiting to see that obama is angry about that stuff too not just that he thinks its wrong intellectually that hes angry

7982882 russia was trying to destroy georgias government something it couldnt do by military force
7982883 since the united states is a permanent member of the security council this simply will be dead on arrival in the security council and therefore in accordance with other security council resolutions that are still in force abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
7982884 this contradicts my own and i think all our ideas
7982885 it was fabulous to visit the museum the icing on the cake was to get to hold bradmans bat it felt terrific it was a very different experience completely unique after all how many people have actually held a bat which bradman actually played with
7982886 i dont think so all the talk about similarity between him and me and our styles of play came from him and it obviously was a great compliment it makes it even bigger coming from him but that compliment was by far the best ive got
7982887 the first time i went to australia was in 1991 and the last time in 2008 i have toured australia a lot and do have some connection with the people there they have been watching me for a long time and they respect the sport something that i truly treasure and value it has been great playing in front of the australian crowds they understand the game and also value different sessions of test cricket they respect me as a player and i respect them as spectators

7982896 so i said schwartz your no 1 job is to finish first in the class and if you got time you know in the evenings or whatever to teach pneumatics hydraulics and electrics to lieutenants then be my guest well he taught pneumatics hydraulics and electrics to all the lieutenants and the captains who needed it plus finished first in his class

7982902 regarding u s policy on settlements its clear its the right policy to try to help bring about a political settlement between israel and the palestinians
7982903 are you saying you can get a charitable deduction for helping starving people in new york city but you cant get a charitable deduction for helping starving people in judea and samaria
7982904 either they stop the settlements or they stop talking about a two state solution
7982905 the u s government has no right to use political considerations when judging humanitarian and non profit needs
7982906 dozens of new families can now come live in hebron only if we renovate this building quickly
7982907 why are the americans talking about getting rid of settlements when they are building a new one right next door

7982942 we have begun preparations for proving the case in the court of law after making significant arrests
7982943 a team of four special public prosecutor spp have been appointed in the case we have discussed various aspects of the case in minute details

7982975 our studies in mice showed that we could selectively kill the defective autoimmune cells that were destroying insulin producing islets

7982982 i believe the strong price rises of the first quarter of 2008 finally began to meet resistance in the second quarter and got reflected in the volume of business transaction during june

7982994 the only way to explain why you would feel good about doing something for somebody else is if you have some sort of stake in their welfare and thats really what the empathy mechanism is all about

7983025 our governor is out of town up in denver for some big party theyre throwing there
7983026 he was the picture of confidence but in some ways the confidence in ones self and confidence in ones country are not the same
7983027 i know that for more than two centuries we have strived at great cost and great sacrifice to form a more perfect union to seek with other nations a more hopeful world what has always united us what has always driven our people what drew my father to americas shores is a set of ideals that speak to aspirations shared by all people that we can live free from fear and free from want that we can speak our minds and assemble with whomever we choose and worship as we please
7983028 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
7983029 i guess we are left to figure out the rest for ourselves
7983030 then our failure to lead by example was the liberation of iraq and if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright because that is a debate i welcome

7983038 this overhaul of the endangered species act would place the fate of rare species in the hands of government stakeholders who are not qualified to assess the environmental impacts of their activities

7983042 forrester analysts tj keitt and paul jackson came up with a new phrase to describe video games
7983043 the phrase the industry should rally around is serious games to bring together the numerous disciplines however forrester recommends identifying individual games with the underlying goal of the game for example calling volvo car uks game an immersive learning simulation we dont see this being an issue in a few years as the old guard in the workforce is replaced by younger colleagues as this happens doubts about calling a game a game will subside future business leaders are already thinking in terms of games as seen with ibms bpm video game coming out of a competition between business students at duke university and the university of north carolina at chapel hill

7983045 there are no great wines only great bottles of wine
7983046 you know what you like and thats all there is to know
7983047 i have only so much money i dont want to waste it on buying wines i may not like
7983048 if i lowered the price id lose money on each wine sale
7983049 but you just said that your wine sales are slow
7983050 yeah the wine doesnt sell as fast as id like it to sell but thats no excuse to give it away
7983051 you wouldnt be giving it away youd be charging a little less so that you can sell the wine faster
7983052 so what would be good about selling it faster at a lower price speed up my losses
7983053 first youd lower inventory carrying costs second faster sales will likely increase wine sales over the course of the year since the price will induce more people to buy more wine from you in retail the idea is called volume selling you move more units and so in the end you make less percentage per unit but more profit on overall sales
7983054 thats plain stupid if i cant get my full mark up id never make a living
7983055 right ill see you in a few months to sell you another case of wine

7983069 the worlds largest online retailer is to start selling wine in the us entering a business fraught with regulatory complexities and littered with the wreckage of previous failures
7983070 amazon is looking to recruit a senior wine buyer whom it says will be responsible for the acquisition of a massive new product selection for its site
7983071 theres not a bottle of wine made worth more than 5 ten dollars would be a stretch
7983072 your color depth is set to a value higher than 256 colors please reduce the color depth to 256 colors and try again
7983073 the wine amp spirits wholesalers of america wswa on tuesday hailed a federal appeals court decision which delivered a stunning victory to states in their bid to maintain prudent regulatory control over alcohol distribution
7983074 costco argued on the basis of its own bottom line in this case
7983075 the 9th circuit court of appeals upheld eight out of nine provisions in washingtons regulatory scheme designed to discourage abuse of alcohol
7983076 among the key washington alcohol regulations affirmed by the court the requirement of a minimum markup designed to ensure that products are not sold too cheaply or below cost
7983077 the appellate court invoked the language of the landmark 2005 granholm v
7983078 they got a dose of old time religion from the judge
7983079 the judge never said in his 40 plus page opinion however that the other laws are particularly good laws since they do in fact result in higher prices for consumers just that they dont facilitate collusion when viewed separately
7983080 we intended to have these anticompetitive laws that raise prices so everyone will drink less and everyone who abuses alcohol will drink less as well that is our game plan the former chair of the lcb even said that you cant look at any component by itself you have to look at the whole system

7983085 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7983086 over time sustained food aid creates dependence on handouts and shifts focus away from improving agricultural practices to increase local food supplies
7983087 ethiopia exemplifies the consequences of giving a starving man a fish instead of teaching him to catch his own
7983088 western governments are loath to halt programs that create a market for their farm surpluses but for countries receiving their charity long term food aid can become addictive
7983089 in 2005 a 1 4 billion five year program identified 7 3 million ethiopians unable to live without free food and gave them jobs in rural projects such as roads and irrigation the idea was to create livelihoods as well as to save lives
7983090 of the 7 3 million 5 4 million suddenly needed extra food aid
7983091 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7983092 the increase in food prices gives afghan farmers another incentive to put a dent in the illegal drugs trade by growing alternative crops the uk is also helping farmers turn and stay away from growing poppies by working to improve security and access to markets critical to combating opium production and this is about more than just tackling the drugs trade its also about addressing food insecurity
7983093 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7983094 we have never been in a situation so severe never ever before
7983095 we do not for the sake of security have journalists reporting from somalia so you dont see the pictures you dont see the reality
7983096 you dont have the impact with the politicians with public opinion and therefore it is a forgotten crisis
7983097 the current situation is unprecedented as nearly the whole country is in crisis
7983098 theres not an obvious sign that points to a runaway situation but thats not to say its not either

7983101 the protest sign weighs more than 2 700 pounds and was sewed together with more than four miles of seams connecting 2 400 sheets and backpacked onto location and is being unfurled by 44 letter carriers with spotters a mile away to ensure proper letter placement
7983102 i couldnt hear the words that were exchanged in the beginning
7983103 they started coming together the officer banished his weapon probably within the first five seconds of the confrontation telling him to get down on the ground the guy kept coming forward the officer told him again get down on the ground the guy wouldnt listen to him kind of with his arms up rushed forward towards him in a quick aggressive manner and the officer shot him
7983104 i can tell you that he is an active lapd officer
7983105 he has about two years on the job and that hes assigned to uniform crime suppression duties out of the office of operations and that he was driving a private vehicle at the time of the incident
7983106 iraq is a sovereign government exercising its judicial system to bring justice to those convicted for brutal crimes against humanity

7983108 the first step is independence then we will determine whether we want to be with our brothers in north ossetia and russia or remain independent
7983109 russia was trying to destroy georgias government something it couldnt do by military force
7983110 since the united states is a permanent member of the security council this simply will be dead on arrival in the security council and therefore in accordance with other security council resolutions that are still in force abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
7983111 this contradicts my own and i think all our ideas
7983112 theres a need the nations at risk and this is what were called on to do

7983119 gen schwartz was always if you will under the gun sometimes we would hit a home run sometimes we would have to go back for more homework
7983120 but it never changed his demeanor hes very level when it comes to his demeanor and the way he approaches problems

7983123 our work with alternate fuels is an indication of the potential for this region to be a national leader in this area
7983124 weve created a very real incubator here for alternative fuels
7983125 all of these joint efforts are critical to our regions reputation as a leader in this arena and we can and must stay ahead of the curve globally to maximize the economic potential of this energy
7983126 our goal at gm is to remove the automobile from the environmental debate altogether
7983127 we can do that with hydrogen and fuel cell vehicles
7983128 i believe if residents see government leading the way in terms of alternative energy they too will join the wave
7983129 we hope this will encourage citizens to consider trying different forms of fuel a hybrid vehicle a flex fuel vehicle so that they focus really on the environmental impact when they buy their next car truck or suv
7983130 since the creation of mankind until the advent of doomsday no fitnah damage will be greater than that of the dajjals anti christ

7983142 apple makes a good operating system we dont deny that
7983143 this is about bringing leopard mac os x 10 5 to the masses
7983144 its not that people dont want to use mac os x but theyre not open spending an exorbitant amount of money for something thats essentially generic hardware
7983145 every single copy of the os is a purchased copy
7983146 despite the allegations that theres a master disc thats not the case and allegations that psystar has somehow modified mac os xs code to run on non apple systems thats also not the case
7983147 there is no modification of any proprietary code of apples
7983148 we purchase copies of mac os directly from apple or from an apple authorized dealer
7983149 no specific precedent but we wouldnt be filing this if we didnt believe we could support it
7983150 what we want to do is provide an alternative to apples hardware

7983160 building the movement of community organizations for community good and social chan ge
7983161 community organizations are criticized by everyone these days consultants tell them theyre doing everything wrong government tells them theyre too small or mismanaged donors tell them there are too many nonprofits and foundations tell them their logic models arent good enough this very large group of organizations and people the overwhelming majority of the nonprofit sector are actually the ones doing most of the work and coming up with the most innovative ideas and energy but too often theyve gotten infected with the self esteem crisis and victim mentality that is constantly being pushed on us
7983162 what i would challenge the gen x and ys to do is to be a bit more patient to work on aspects of how we can go about changing our work and approach and not toss everything out but take what works and improve on it many times i see a strong disregard for what we older ones have created and no recognition or appreciation for the context that led to the practice lets work on improvements together
7983163 organizations must change their recruitment practices to attract next generation leaders
7983164 organizations must change their employment practices to retain next generation leaders
7983165 organizations must do more to professionally develop future nonprofit leaders from within

7983197 this is a disappointing result since the last two years were generally very good for the state economy as measured by personal income and job growth

7983206 the nonprofit sector is viewed as a desirable place to work and to seek future employment by people interested in social change
7983207 however the long hours and compromised personal lives associated with executive leadership are significant deterrents to pursuing top positions

7983269 i am more afraid that this people have so much confidence in their leaders that they will not inquire for themselves of god whether they are led by him i am fearful they settle down in a state of blind self security trusting their eternal destiny in the hands of their leaders with a reckless confidence that in itself would thwart the purposes of god in their salvation

7983466 it sounded like they didnt want him to be president
7983467 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7983468 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7983469 clearly we feel that there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified those agencies
7983470 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he ought to be shot
7983471 do you think they were really plotting to kill obama
7983472 i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
7983473 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7983474 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7983475 seems more like an attempt by zog to assassinate us
7983476 it wouldnt surprise me if these people are jews sic or dumb patsies involved in yet another false flag mossad operation in order to conjure up yet more anti gun legislation
7983477 if obama is assassinated it will be the govt doing it and well take the blame like always
7983478 real white men wouldnt have been stopped from completing their mission whatever it may be
7983479 seriously plots that are this serious dont come to the surface so easily the government law enforcement agencies may be expecting obama to win and so are getting ready to conduct a preemptive strike against wnist white nationalist organizations
7983480 sound like a bunch of wannabe small timers to me they need to make sure that obamas black ass is protected his death would bring down a s tstorm of hell upon all of us

7983510 vi cuatro objetos en forma de discos que circulaban en formaci n y en sentido perpendicular o vertical distanciados unos de otros unos 300 mt blancos amarillentos muy brillantes con halos de luces rojo naranjas fijas y azules intermitentes dejando una estela blanca que despareci al instante
7983511 se ve a bastante alto pero no pod a decirles a que altura yo no s lo que era pero eran unas luces muy muy brillantes hab a tres luces azules en un primer momento y que parec a ir en sentido de las agujas del reloj entonces lleg la luz roja parpadeante y en alg n momento la luz empez a ir hacia la izquierda
7983512 desde un punto de vista militar todo el ministerio de defensa har es comprobar que inform de estos objetos no son una amenaza para el pa s y que nuestro espacio a reo no ha sido violado m s all de eso no es de inter s p blico la investigaci n para saber que son estos objetos y gastar recursos en verdad muchos de ellos puede explicarse a trav s de aviones militares luces etc que yo sepa la informaci n no ha pasado a otro rgano del gobierno para su investigaci n

7983523 like companies across the land blackwater sought to be designated as a small business to win contracts more easily from the state department or other agencies but is it also possible that government procurement officials wanted to apply the designation to blackwater to make it easier to award the contracts dont laugh it happens all the time
7983524 as has been the case each year since ive been here were challenging ourselves in the non league part of our schedule to get ready for a very difficult acc schedule

7983526 president bushs new choice to lead the u s small business administration sandy baruah is already raising some questions and concerns among small business groups namely shouldnt the head of the governments small business arm have actual experience running a small business
7983527 last month we blogged about the american small business leagues asbl claim that the bush administration through the small business administration sba has lied to congress and the public about the extent to which federal small business contracts end up going to some of the worlds largest companies with the release of this doi ig report the asbl reiterates that claim according to the asbl the sba is misleading the public in press statements that characterize the 5 7 million cited in the report as the total amount of small business contracts that went to large companies neglecting to point out that the figure comes from a survey of just a tiny fraction of all small business contracts awarded by the doi the report reviewed just 0 3 of the 4 billion doi bureaus awarded to small business entities during fiscal years 2006 2007 the asbl however decided to investigate further it conducted a review of the dois top 100 recipients of federal small business contracts for 2006 and 2007 between the two top 100 lists the asbl found more than 430 million in federal small business contracts had been awarded to 31 large corporations most of which are fortune 500 companies based on the doi ig reports methodology the asbl estimates the total amount of small business contracts awarded to large corporations by the doi could exceed 1 7 billion for 2006 and 2007 some may scoff at the asbls findings and somewhat heated rhetoric however a glance at appendix 3 in the doi ig report which lists numerous other recent government reports that highlight serious problems in the small business contracting program indicates the asbl is probably on the right track

7983534 los animales parec an haber sido arrojados desde el aire
7983535 hemos encontrado hembras de ciervo muertas comenta a la prensa en un trayecto de 1 000 metros que presentan extra os cortes no se ven golpes o disparos de arma de fuego y en los lugares no hay manchas del sangrado
7983536 nadie puede explicar qu pasa dicen que ya ocurri con otros animales y llevaron muestras para analizar los cortes son perfectos e id nticos sobre la misma zona del cuerpo se observan como quemaduras producidas por un elemento el ctrico
7983537 haciendo una disecci n se observa que tiene afectada la parte de la tr quea y paladar duro
7983538 la mucosa del paladar duro de la boca est como mutilada hasta carbonizada
7983539 convencido de la visita de inteligencia extraterrestre a nuestro planeta pero no podemos meter todo en la misma bolsa
7983540 carecen de la informaci n y formaci n para distinguir si esto es producto de una operaci n de alg n servicio de inteligencia para gubernamental o una operaci n extraterrestre se invocan los cortes perfectos en la mand bula y quemaduras en una de las patas del animal hasta la rodilla lo que la gente ignora es que hay una serie de herramientas para hacer esto
7983541 mutilaciones extra as y ex ticas en todo el mundo
7983542 lo que sucede en argentina parece tener otras razones de ser la explosi n de mutilaciones esconde otras cosas se est n enmascarando algo en el pa s se han realizado desde 1985 experimentos de guerra bacteriol gica en contubernio con laboratorios extranjeros y con fuerzas militares norteamericanas en el 85 se comenzaron a experimentar los denominados virus recombinantes estas son combinaciones de dos virus distintos que si no matan por una sintomatolog a matan por la otra en 1987 los experimentos se suspenden porque se dice que se salieron de control pero los animales fueron obsequiados a los peones de la zona en azul provincia de buenos aires peri dicamente aproximadamente cada dos a os parece haber un rebrote de la cepa vir sica que se manifiesta en lo que se conoce como el virus de azul y provoca algunas muertes este virus afecta partes espec ficas de los organismos de los mam feros ojos o dos lengua ano y genitales que son las mismas partes de la anatom a de las vacas que son mutiladas
7983543 hubo una paranoia mundial por el ntrax en argentina no hubo ning n caso declarado sin embargo entre 2003 y 2004 hubo 182 casos de ntrax en el departamento nogoy y cinco de ellos fueron fatales desde 2002 se detect la presencia de marines en islas del ibicuy y hasta pocas muy recientes se realizan en la zona del delta del paran las operaciones de los famosos helic pteros negros islas del ibicuy nogoy victoria estamos hablando de una zona que ha sido laboratorio de pruebas clandestinas de fuerzas norteamericanas y tal vez lo siga siendo porque hasta hace semanas se segu an viendo los helic pteros negros sin marcas de identificaci n que acompa an las operaciones clandestinas estadounidenses en distintas partes del mundo
7983544 algunos expertos explican que los ataques las mutilaciones son ejecutados de forma inteligente y empleando elementos quir rjicos que s lo alguien bien preparado y conocedor de la anatom a animal puede llevar a cabo adem s el agresor parece haber sembrado pistas desconcertantes en los entornos de los hechos con un solo objetivo crear confusi n pero qui n estar a tras este tipo de experimentaci n qu intereses representar a
7983545 existen mutilaciones causadas por agentes extra os pero no todas las ocurridas en argentinas son provocadas por stos
7983546 en las inspecciones que se han hecho no hemos constatado ning n inconveniente en las puertas o algunas huellas porque esa cantidad de animales dejan un rastro que deber a seguirse hay gente que est abocada exclusivamente a eso y estamos trabajando en los departamentos lim trofes tambi n

7983549 there will be times when the present public viewing area will be crowded and the plaintiffs in this lawsuit as well as others will be frustrated
7983550 there are so many individuals and groups that want to be heard on public issues that that would be inevitable even if a larger area were possible
7983551 just like his predecessor sandy baruah has no background experience or interest in small business issues i am concern the bush administration will continue to dismantle programs for small businesses in middle class america by dramatically increasing the federal definition of a small business to allow large businesses to take contracts away from small firms i am also concerned the bush administration will try to close the small business administration all together by combining it with the commerce department

7983884 pressure to fix the small business set aside program is mounting half the federal contracts designated for small businesses in 2005 and 2006 about 100 billion a year went to big firms including multinational corporations thats according to documents the small business administration sba handed over to the american small business league asbl under court order this month stricter controls are likely next year certification procedures have already been adjusted once by the sba to cut down on abuses but congress and small business groups want the agency to do a lot more

7983887 and that was done in this case it just always fell short
7983888 im not going to say what that significant piece of information was all i can say is that it was enough to properly lay a charge of first degree
7983889 we believe we have a significant and strong case and its before the courts now
7983890 based upon a number of federal investigations that have been done on this subject such as 5 14 5 15 and 5 16 from the sba office of inspector general and our analysis of this information it looks like the pattern that we are seeing in 2005 and 2006 will be repeated every year during the bush administration if that holds true the bush administration will have diverted somewhere between 500 and 800 billion from our nations middle class economy its time for congress to call for a gao investigation to get to the bottom of this issue the bush administration has consistently tried to paint me as a conspiracy theorist based on the release of this data and the fact that i have won five federal lawsuits against the bush administration i expect that will be a more difficult job for them in the future i would like to see the media report this story accurately and responsibly and start listening to sources outside the sbas press office the facts dont lie
7983891 the budget for the sba dropped to 571 8 million in fiscal 2007 from 2 23 billion in fiscal 2006 including all supplemental funding and congressional earmarks reported the sba

7983897 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
7983898 as a christian when you experience a painful providence like an illness or a rebellious child or a broken marriage or a financial hardship or persecution do you ever wonder if god is punishing you for some sin you committed

7983939 this is an age of great thoughts of man and small sentimental thoughts of god within evangelical christendom hardly less than outside it charles simeon would tell us that we have things topsy turvy nor can we expect god to honor our preaching unless we honor him by giving him his rightful place in the center of our message and by reducing man to what he really is a helpless worthless rebel creature saved only by a miracle of omnipotent holy love and saved not for his own sake but for the praise of his savior he would tell us that we can only expect great blessing on our preaching when our sole concern is to do what he himself was solely concerned to do to magnify the great god who works all things to his own glory and to exalt his son as a great savior of great sinners

7983945 expository preaching is the preaching of the man who knows holy scripture to be the living word of the living god and who desires only that it should be free to speak its own message to sinful men and women who therefore preaches from a text and in preaching labors as the puritans would say to open it or in charles simeons phrase to bring out of the text what is there whose whole aim in preaching is to show his hearers what the text is saying to them about god and about themselves and to lead them into what barth called the strange new world within the bible in order that they may be met by him who is the lord of that world

7984002 christian churches are being ruined and thousands of christians are homeless and banished in kosovo
7984003 this is also the case of the cypriot area illegally occupied by turkish forces churches are destroyed and christians are suffering there
7984004 turkey seeks the accession to the european union but it disregards the needs of its christian population

7984009 all i can say is that it is taking place in the area that is under direct control of the turkish military and i leave you to make your own conclusions from that
7984010 i dont think the cyprus problem has ever been a religious issue between the greek and turkish cypriots
7984011 so it is either directly taking place or with their blind eye or whatever you want to call it but they are responsible for what is taking place there
7984012 there is only so much oxygen that exists from a journalistic point of view
7984013 when one picks up the paper and looks at international issues what does one see either a bombing that took place in the middle east or a bombing in iraq or loss of life in afghanistan issues such as that
7984014 although there are issues that appear to be more important than the cyprus issue because we dont have that immediacy of seeing deaths or events on a daily basis in cyprus thankfully that does not make the continuing occupation by turkey of the northern part of cyprus any more acceptable

7984017 o death where is your sting o hades where is your victory
7984018 for if we have been united together in the likeness of his death certainly we also shall be in the likeness of his resurrection now if we died with christ we believe that we shall also live with him
7984019 likewise you also reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin but alive to god in christ jesus our lord therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in its lusts
7984020 how shall we who died to sin live any longer in it
7984021 therefore we were buried with him through baptism into death that just as christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life
7984022 indeed the lord confirmed the truth of the resurrection after forty days by different appearances and numerous forms in order to prove to us that we are engaged in the resurrection for a new life in the likeness of his resurrection in newness of life

7984024 the time is short so that from now on even those who have wives should be as though they had none those who weep as though they did not weep those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice those who buy as though they did not possess and those who use this world as not misusing it
7984025 if then you were raised with christ seek those things which are above where christ is sitting at the right hand of god for you died and your life is hidden with christ in god when christ who is our life appears then you also will appear with him in glory
7984026 the truth is that islam is not a religion of peace this is not to say that every muslim is violent at heart many are not muslims have the same aspirations for living peaceful lives that people have the world over but they also have the same potential for violence as others and islam as a religion and an ideology seeks to exploit that potential
7984027 the notion that religion and political authority church and state are different and that they can or should be separated is in a profound sense christian its origins may be traced to the teachings of christ notably in the famous passage in matthew 22 21 in which christ is quoted as saying render therefore unto caesar the things which are caesars and unto god the things that are gods this notion was confirmed by the experience of the first christians its later development was shaped and in a sense even imposed by the subsequent history of christendom the persecutions endured by the early church made it clear that a separation between the two was possible
7984028 in pagan rome caesar was god christians were taught to differentiate between what is due to caesar and what is due to god for muslims of the classical age god was caesar and the sovereign caliph or sultan was merely his viceregent on earth this was more than a simple legal fiction for muslims the state was gods state the army gods army and of course the enemy was gods enemy of more practical importance the law was gods law and in principle there could be no other the question of separating church and state did not arise since there was no church as an autonomous institution to be separated church and state were one and the same
7984029 jihad is a religious obligation it forms part of the duties that the believer must fulfill it is islams normal path to expansion
7984030 split into squabbling petty kingdoms its churches divided by schism and heresy with constant quarrels between the churches of rome and the east it was disputed between two emperors and for a while even two popes after the loss of the christian shores of the eastern and southern mediterranean to the muslim advance christendom seemed even more local confided in effect to a small peninsula on the western edge of asia which became and was by this confinement defined as europe for a time indeed for a very long time it seemed that nothing could prevent the ultimate triumph of islam and the extension of the islamic faith and muslim power to europe
7984031 from the fury of the mohammedan spare us o lord was a prayer heard for centuries in all the churches of central and southern europe fear of the jihad has not entirely vanished even now particularly among peoples who have known muslim domination
7984032 naples genoa ravenna ostia and even rome itself were all for a time pillaged or occupied by the saracens human beings became a cheap and abundant commodity in rome in 846 the muslims even looted the churches of st peter and st paul and the pope had to buy off the invaders with the promised tribute of 25 000 silver coins a year pope leo iv then ordered the construction of the leonine wall around the city to protect st peters from further assault
7984033 by 1920 it seemed that the triumph of europe over islam was total and final the vast territories and countless millions of the muslim peoples of asia and africa were firmly under the control of the european empires some of them under a variety of native princes most under direct colonial administration only a few remote mountain and desert areas too poor and too difficult to be worth the trouble of acquiring retained some measure of sovereign independence
7984034 as an outer darkness of barbarism and unbelief from which there was nothing to learn and little even to be imported except slaves and raw materials for both the northern european and southern african barbarians their best hope was to be incorporated into the empire of the caliphs and thus attain the benefits of religion and civilization
7984035 when things go wrong in a society in a way and to a degree that can no longer be denied or concealed there are various questions that one can ask
7984036 the basic fault according to most of these memoranda was falling away from the good old ways islamic and ottoman the basic remedy was a return to them this diagnosis and prescription still command wide acceptance in the middle east
7984037 after world war ii the west in turn began to retreat the colonial empires disappeared first arab nationalism and then islamic fundamentalism manifested themselves the centuries old military interaction between the west and islam is unlikely to decline it could become more virulent the gulf war left some arabs feeling proud that saddam hussein had attacked israel and stood up to the west it also left many feeling humiliated and resentful of the wests military presence in the persian gulf the wests overwhelming military dominance and their apparent inability to shape their own destiny
7984038 on both sides the interaction between islam and the west is seen as a clash of civilizations
7984039 many arab countries in addition to the oil exporters are reaching levels of economic and social development where autocratic forms of government become inappropriate and efforts to introduce democracy become stronger some openings in arab political systems have already occurred the principal beneficiaries of these openings have been islamist movements in the arab world in short western democracy strengthens anti western political forces

7984041 slay the idolaters wherever you find them arrest them besiege them and lie in ambush everywhere for them if they repent and take to prayer and render the alms levy allow them to go their way god is forgiving and merciful
7984042 fight against those to whom the scriptures were given as believe in neither god nor the last day who do not forbid what god and his messenger have forbidden and who do not embrace the true faith until they pay tribute out of hand and are utterly subdued
7984043 believers why is it that when you are told march in the cause of god you linger slothfully in the land are you content with this life in preference to the life to come if you do not go to war he god will punish you sternly and will replace you by other men
7984044 believers shall i point out to you a profitable course that will save you from a woeful scourge have faith in god and his messenger and fight for gods cause with your wealth and with your persons he will forgive you your sins and admit you to gardens watered by running streams he will lodge you in pleasant mansions in the gardens of eden this is the supreme triumph
7984045 some critics may object that this account of islam in the modern world does not pay much attention to islamic moderation to the everyday wish of everyday muslims for a quiet life this is not because such moderates are rare but because they are rarely important religions like political ideologies are pushed along by money power and tiny vocal minorities within islam the money and the power are all pushing the wrong way so are the most active minorities the urgent need is to recognize this our problem is not prejudice about islam but folly in the face of its violence and cruelty and in any case the willingness of moderates to be what are objectively bad muslims because they reject key teachings of historical islam may be laudable in human terms but does nothing to modify islam as a doctrine
7984046 whoever can read the quran can judge for himself in matters of doctrine

7984056 i got up to get baptized thats when my mother got up ran to the front and tried to pull me out of the water
7984057 they told people i died in an accident rather than having the shame of their son leaving islam
7984058 i believe the classical law of apostasy in islam is wrong and based on a misunderstanding of the original sources because the quran and hadith dont actually talk about a death penalty for apostasy
7984059 as a convert from islam myself part of my lifes work has been to seek to see this most cruel of laws removed from islam and to see that christians like myself are given freedom to choose and believe without facing persecution and possibly death
7984060 it is good to hear imams like usama hassan stating clearly that he believes the classical law of apostasy in islam is wrong and denouncing those who advocate the death penalty

7984498 the tree frogs are so loud as well as the crickets
7984499 you make me smile award ive finally worked out how to put it at the side
7984500 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
7984501 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
7984502 for me the whole goal is to stay relevant as long as i can
7984503 its one thing to still be doing it but to still have your records played on the radio and to have contemporary success thats whats exciting
7984504 radio has said to me in so many words if you do great work well play it but if its average youll have to stand in line
7984505 ive always been a country singer with a lot of influences
7984506 and i think thats helped me because i can do a variety of songs

7984517 i commend cnn and soledad obrien for tackling this very important topic but to expose an audience to this theory is very troubling and disappointing

7984522 not only are researchers at hopkins working on this problem but people are working on this issue right there in atlanta where cnn is headquartered the problem of health disparities is complex by trying to reduce it to a simplistic explanation we risk having health care providers policymakers and patients feel there is nothing they can do to address the issue

7984561 more than half of afghanistan provinces are now poppy free
7984562 the gains in the north and east show that counternarctocis efforts can succeed

7984626 were doing a pretty good job of keeping a lid on things

7984671 it took two years of catching her in her breeding cycle putting merlin with her every day during her cycle coaching him along and stopping her from being aggressive toward him
7984672 id stand there with a net and defend him and when he was doing well give him nuts
7984673 also id give her treats to calm her down so shed sit there and eat rather than attack him
7984674 we need to build facilities so that these animals can live in the social structure required for their natural reproductive behaviors to emerge and continue

7984676 i have spent days and nights thinking about why i said what i did in front of the sec on may 25 2007

7984678 weve done everything we entered victoria crater to do and more
7984679 our experience tells us theres lots of diversity among the cobbles
7984680 we want to get a better characterization of them a statistical sampling from examining more of them will be important for understanding the geology of the area
7984681 the patterns broadly resemble what we saw at the smaller craters opportunity explored earlier
7984682 by looking deeper into the layering we are looking farther back in time
7984683 if opportunity were driving with only five wheels like spirit it probably would never get out of victoria crater
7984684 we also know from experience with spirit that if opportunity were to lose the use of a wheel after it is out on the level ground mobility should not be a problem
7984685 both rovers show signs of aging but they are both still capable of exciting exploration and scientific discovery
7984686 the principle is similar to the virtual shoe fitting mirror that we developed last year for the adidas flagship store in paris
7984687 but it is somewhat more difficult to create a realistic impression of t shirts shirts or sweaters in a virtual mirror these items of clothing develop folds that partially distort the image depending how the wearer moves about
7984688 to reproduce elastic deformations such as those in a woven or knitted fabric we have to evaluate many different parameters and process them all simultaneously
7984689 calculating the spatial parameters of the projected image on the basis of a two dimensional model this reduces the number of dimensions we need to simulate the image and allows us to rapidly evaluate any movements
7984690 the virtual mirror could also be used to help customers select eyewear or jewelry
7984691 dr dre is mourning the loss of his son andre young jr
7984692 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions

7984695 the people who support hillary when they hear from her i dont think they will have any problem supporting obama
7984696 im voting for hillary on the first ballot and after that im voting for obama
7984697 if youre going to have a roll call you cant cut it off if you do youre going to have some people leave here still unhappy you want them to leave here as happy as they can be
7984698 i think obamas people in new york and obama himself have to do something with the new york people
7984699 it wouldnt hurt for him to appear with the senator and ask for the help that she got clearly new york is still hillarys house
7984700 it would be important for him to come to new york and be with her there that sends a clearer message than if you say it in denver
7984701 you are not a number you are not a slave you are no longer a prisoner live the reality of your new identity
7984702 our fathers love is eternal its been permanently fixed upon you its been attached to you forever
7984703 his love for you is not haphazard it is intentional
7984704 you and i are mephibosheth we are crippled in both feet we have nothing good to offer god yet god in his great love searches for us and despite our brokenness he pulls us into his family and seats us at his table
7984705 the commands god gives us is for us to be holy because he is holy love because he first loved live a godly life in response to him being a pure and righteous god
7984706 he demands for us to trust him with every aspect of our being
7984707 that is the one thing god told us and the lord jesus told us in the very last command he gave
7984708 its a lifetime commitment to following jesus thats what a disciple does its one who follows jesus continuously god wants to change our lives so we also make disciples and become disciples
7984709 educations purpose is to replace an empty mind with an open one
7984710 i have seen senator obama under situations of extreme stress
7984711 ive never seen him lose his temper this is an extraordinary quality
7984712 mccain is well known for losing it in a variety of circumstances
7984713 just say john mccain does not have an even temper and ask how is that going to factor into national security
7984714 not to disparage mccains age because im getting close to it myself i just sense that obama is acutely aware of the phenomena of the 21st century
7984715 they say our enemy is now china or now russia or islamic terrorism and they build a theory around that kind of thing in my view thats ill conceived
7984716 we had to leave the house before it got worse

7984724 current regulations governing the quality of herbal supplements made and sold in the us and india are inadequate
7984725 we recommend strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for manufacturers should have to demonstrate compliance with these standards through independent third party laboratory testing
7984726 although the current study focused on ayurvedic medicines reports of similar problems with toxic metals in other
7984727 products made by members of the american herbal product assn capsules liquids pastes are less likely to contain
7984728 products that have obtained seals of quality approval from consumer
7984729 but i have a good story to tell ive got a story that talks about virginia and how we actually got democrats and republicans to work together how we brought real results to rural communities how we realized that in a 21st century economy a lot of these issues do not break down along traditional partisan lines
7984730 the only thing i am aspiring to right now is to have the people of virginia hire me to be a senator
7984731 i think my value add would be to put together what i am calling the radical centrists a bipartisan group of senators that could maybe say no to the political extremes on both sides
7984732 that means youve got to look at each issue and realize that if its a good idea you shouldnt care about where it originated
7984733 valid under venezuelas constitution as with any tool of democracy it depends how it is used
7984734 you will be more than guaranteed in the hands of the republic and you know the banking sector of venezuela is one of the most solid in the world
7984735 riot police used tear gas as they blocked hundreds of venezuelans protesting what they call new moves by president chavez to concentrate his power
7984736 blacklists barring key opposition candidates from elections and socialist decrees destroying whats left of their democracy

7984740 conducted strictly on legal and administrative grounds carried out as part of the constitutional and legal obligations of the office of the comptroller general taken following
7984741 is using his decree powers to enact a set of socialist inspired measures that seem based on a package of constitutional changes
7984742 when the government acts as it has now without respecting the constitution and the word of the president is the law then an act of tyranny is being committed
7984743 formalize socialist inspired policies on the margins of the formal economy like a measure declaring barter a legitimate system of payment
7984744 the coming regional elections have the potential to erode the presidents power base
7984745 to set up neighborhood based militias state control over agriculture
7984746 chavez enact ing aggressive new laws with an iron fist increasing the states power over the economy ahead of key regional elections
7984747 drive to create a socialist state significantly increase his power and resemble proposals included in a constitutional reform narrowly rejected by voters in a december referendum
7984748 up in arms over a raft of decree laws they say replicate constitutional reforms
7984749 typical of mr chavezs authoritarian streak and will let him expropriate private property without the need for the ans approval
7984750 ambitious decrees which formalize the creation of a popular militia and further consolidate state control over key areas of the economy such as agriculture and tourism
7984751 bypass ing congress in making laws and being back on the offensive after suffering a humiliating defeat in december that might have let him stay in power for life
7984752 accusations that mr chavez is evading the will of the people
7984753 we are in the presence of a dictatorial government which has given a coup detat to the constitution here we have no constitution no law and the president does exactly what he wants
7984754 everything hes doing is related to the upcoming election and its hard to imagine he doesnt see this as important in his efforts to keep power
7984755 put ting down all challengers to his power forcibly if necessary
7984756 get in the way of mr chavezs caudillo aspirations at your peril
7984757 its horrific what ice is doing to these families and these communities
7984758 its just hard to imagine that this is the united states
7984759 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7984760 there is no way i will vote for any ticket with obamas name on it i will vote for john mccain instead
7984761 is that every delegate would stand up for her and she will be the nominee
7984762 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7984763 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7984764 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care

7984770 this agreement affirms our actions and we are continuing to make full refunds to all affected customers
7984771 confidence is still quite depressed but its a glimmer of hope from the lows we saw in june
7984772 consumer confidence readings suggest the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year
7984773 the data today paint a mixed picture but its clear it will still take some time to work through the downturn in housing
7984774 sat on the sidelines opposing and delaying urgent reforms to our housing markets
7984775 as our housing market continues to struggle barack obamas plans for tax increases and government spending will cost jobs at a time when we need them most

7984789 i have sad news after 11 years we will be publishing a final 2008 issue of smartphone amp pocket pc magazine and then suspend publication we are working hard to make it the best windows mobile issue ever a keeper a reference guide it is with great regret i make this announcement we are a very small self funded magazine publishing company we did not make this decision lightly especially after 11 years of issues it has become harder and harder to grow our circulation over the past three years since windows mobile changed from being pdas to being phones pocket pc manufacturers like hp used to work with us to offer their customers a free issue of our magazine in their packaging the phone companies have not shown similar interest in working with us the other business challenge has been the lack of advertising sponsorship from microsoft phone companies and oems despite our coverage of their products in order for us to sell subscriptions at current low consumer magazine type prices we must have a stronger and growing circulation and we much attract the large advertisers who benefit the most from our existence of course the irony is that almost 20 million windows mobile units were sold this past microsoft fiscal year we think there is a great opportunity to continue the magazine in this high growth smartphone market for a more sophisticated publishing company or a funded entrepreneur

7984797 lets talk about how absolutely awful it was trying to leave the polo fields when radiohead ended we stood at a complete standstill for about 45 minutes before making it to the fence and we were able to avoid jumping the fence like so many others we thought we were in the clear until a hive of bees attacked those of us leaving the fields bees people with stingers i was stung no less than six times once in my hand
7984798 its still early but id be surprised if i see anything at outside lands that impresses me more than the coups set its always the same deal with this east bay troupe led by genius rapper boots riley whether they are playing coachella or rock the bells or now outside they always seem to outshine the competition

7984804 there are two extremes on the one hand is paranoia and on the other is oblivion
7984805 were just trying to get people to keep this on their radar
7984806 but we cant say its never going to happen again its when is it going to happen and we have to be prepared to survive that
7984807 you more or less are giving them a blueprint for how to avoid law enforcement
7984808 i do think its important that we talk to our folks and give them some guidance on how to protect themselves and others
7984809 its not something that 10 years ago we thought wed be talking about but unfortunately its something we need to do now
7984810 we live in a mud hut with only two rooms i dont know how were going to afford 10 children now
7984811 we were simply blessed by god that no complication happened if there had been a complication ghazala would have died
7984812 you cannot take this risk because of the complications to the mother and the babies
7984813 even if she had a period of infertility thats an indication that you should be careful when you stimulate
7984814 the important question to ask is why did she want to become pregnant after already having three children
7984815 its because she had three daughters and didnt have a boy in many parts of egypt if she doesnt have a boy its as if she didnt have children at all
7984816 its just so rare that all the eggs would get fertilized with regular intercourse

7984852 some countries spend more on subsidizing oil than they do on health and education combined
7984853 in the final analysis many fossil fuel subsidies are introduced for political reasons but are simply propping up and perpetuating inefficiencies in the global economy
7984854 urgently review their energy subsidies and begin phasing out the harmful ones
7984855 its clearly an area that we need to re examine in our fight against climate change

7984874 the obama campaign has launched a new ad that fails to dispute a single fact in the american issues projects initial ad questioning barack obamas relationship with admitted domestic terrorist william ayers
7984875 this response ad is more smoke and mirrors from a candidate desperate to obscure his longstanding relationship with admitted domestic terrorist william ayers

7985096 prescription medication borrowing and sharing are a concern for womens healthcare providers and public health professionals because of the potential health effects for women and the possibility of teratogenic effects on the developing embryo or fetus
7985097 suggesting that potentially teratogenic medications are available for borrowing and sharing in this population
7985098 the risks of medication sharing should be discussed with patients when a healthcare provider is prescribing a medication that might be of teratogenic or other risk if the medication is used by persons other than those for whom it was prescribed
7985099 women might act as family doctors making them more comfortable in sharing prescriptions or prescribing them for others
7985100 daily multivitamin use might serve as a proxy for following public health recommendations
7985101 future studies are necessary to determine why women believe the reasons provided for medication borrowing or sharing are acceptable so that interventions can be developed to counteract these behaviors

7985106 these findings refute the pervasive but unproven belief that these foods are associated with diverticular complications and suggest that the recommendation to avoid these foods in diverticular disease should be reconsidered
7985107 although the p for trends for the associations between increasing consumption of nuts and popcorn and the risk of diverticulitis were significant
7985108 the patterns of the hrs across consumption categories did not indicate dose response relationships

7985126 i have had such a good time since i got here and it happened again for that heat
7985127 i was in the final of the billabong pro junior sunday and to start off with a strong result is a great confidence boost
7985128 that wave is so fun long and if you get the good ones you can get points
7985129 it is a big event and the level will be hard so i will keep enjoying myself and not think of any result
7985130 i was lucky because the first better sets were showing during my heat and i got the better waves
7985131 i have had a long time out of the water because of my injury and it is very important to be able to get back to your best level for confidence i hope i can keep going tomorrow

7985134 funding arrangements for schools that are riddled with anomalies and flaws
7985135 the only way out in the longer term is for a root and branch review of the arrangements involving all funding partners
7985136 1 5 billion for government schools would be required merely to reclaim the sector shares in place at the outset of the howard years
7985137 if continued they will result in a cut in real terms for the school system that educates the majority of australian children
7985138 howard government policies benefited non government schools by almost 3 billion in real terms a funding advantage of around 2 5 billion over the real increases provided for government schools
7985139 pizza is one of the most widely eaten dishes in the world and it should never cost more than 3 50 5 99
7985140 we launched this initiative because pizza has become more and more expensive vis a vis the general surge in food prices and we want to help consumers and their families make ends meet each month
7985141 pizza is a poor mans dish and a passing fancy for the rich
7985142 i think its no secret and ive said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think the settlement activity is helpful to the process
7985143 what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7985144 i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together over this period of time
7985145 so we will continue to press ahead to get agreement so that we know what is in israel and what is in palestine that is ultimately the goal
7985146 initiated 433 new housing units during the period of january to may 2008 compared to just 240 units during the period january to may 2007
7985147 which still continue and which without a doubt are the main obstacle in the political process
7985148 just because we have not yet succeeded does not mean we have failed
7985149 the coming weeks will be decisive for the peace process we are at a crossroads and the efforts and the meetings will continue in order to build on the ideas presented for the first time today
7985150 will continue efforts to reach a historic agreement by the end of the bush administration
7985151 i would like to suggest to my partners not to use it as an excuse and i know they are not using it as an excuse but i understand their frustration sometimes
7985152 there were some small activities but they will not influence the ability to negotiate nor the future borders of the palestinian state
7985153 i thank god who has been with me through this gruelling election process i thank the voters
7985154 the message is clear we have made a demand for change for freedom and for justice
7985155 the people do not want to be exploited we want an economic order that protects all the people
7985156 yes of course we have lost we were the underdogs going into this race
7985157 this is a clear indication that people of all races have rejected the communal politics of barisan nasional it is a clear endorsement of our reform agenda we are on track to take over the government
7985158 i sent my mum a text phone message i love you and i am going down

7985160 experienced an in flight depressurisation incident which caused the oxygen masks on board to deploy
7985161 as a safety precaution the captain descended and diverted the aircraft to limoges airport
7985162 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons he was hyperventilating i looked at the lady on my left and hers hadnt filled up either
7985163 i would say some people thought we were going to die
7985164 for about half an hour no one told us anything we didnt know what was happening at all we were quite panicky
7985165 after half an hour we were told to take the oxygen mask off and then the plane landed and we were fine
7985166 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
7985167 they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
7985168 as the passengers confirmed the pilot did make an announcement once he got down to 8000 feet where it is safe to take the oxygen masks off that they were diverting to limoges
7985169 the irish and french aviation authorities have been notified of this incident and a full investigation of this incident will be undertaken later today
7985170 were here to say thank you to hillary and to protest the fraud perpetrated on us by the democratic national committee
7985171 it wasnt a contest it was a foregone conclusion they the dnc leadership just decided that barack obama was going to win
7985172 its going to be the first time since 1976 that i havent voted i just dont trust obama i think hell do more harm than good
7985173 were here to tell the democratic leadership that its not okay to ignore 18 million voices
7985174 i dont trust obama he flip flops all the time we dont know anything about his past how do we know hes not some kind of militant im voting for mccain
7985175 theres a lot of us who feel pissed and angry at the party for the way hillary was treated there was a lot of sexism in the media and the whole process seemed rigged against her
7985176 at the moment i dont know who i am voting for i want to be able to forgive barack obama but what happened to hillary bugs me i dont know though that i could bring myself to vote for a republican
7985177 i was unhappy and upset that she lost but im going to be voting for obama in november
7985178 hes a brilliant leader and we have to have unity in the party to win the election
7985179 im disappointed hurt and angry about hillary but im not deluded
7985180 four more years of a bush presidency under mccain would be a disaster for our country
7985181 i can understand art being upset at my criticism because ive hardly written anything about him before this but ive written a ton of complimentary articles about you

7985184 gustav continues to represent a potential threat to oil and gas installations in the gulf region and will be watched with vigilance
7985185 given the current track for gustav and the expectation that it might enter the gulf of mexico this weekend we are making logistical arrangements to evacuate staff who are not essential to production or drilling operations
7985186 evacuations could begin as early as tomorrow there is no impact on production at this time
7985187 in the face of the danger threatening haiti i ask national civil protection committees and our friends in international cooperation to help the government manage the risks and disasters
7985188 after 20 minutes the pilot called nyala airport to tell him the plane had been hijacked and that he is en route to tripoli in libya
7985189 i am worried about my father and mother they are coming from nyala on this flight no one has any information about the situation they are in
7985190 this is the result of what the government is doing in the camps of displaced people in nyala
7985191 im not sure if its connected to kalma but its related to that the government kills and the international community does not intervene what can the darfurian people do
7985192 above all else we want a candidate with a relentless passion to succeed whatever the adversity
7985193 the type of person we will be looking for is someone whose cup is always half full never half empty someone who can laugh at themselves a strong team player who sees this as a lifetime opportunity and can tell a good joke to keep others spirits up
7985194 let there be no mistake about it we are united
7985195 tonight when hillary clinton speaks she will be an articulate voice for the working men and women the middle class families that have been squeezed and she will make the case as she uniquely can for why barack obama is the right choice for the presidency
7985196 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7985197 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7985198 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7985199 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and me our country will be committed to his cause
7985200 the work will begin anew the hope will rise again and the dream lives on
7985201 this is a historic day for hp and eds and for the clients we serve
7985202 independently each company is a respected industry leader together we are a global leader with the capability to serve our clients whatever their size location or sector with one of the most comprehensive and competitive portfolios in the industry
7985203 this is kind of the last thing we want to do
7985204 from the perspective of what is going on in the airline industry i dont think it is completely unreasonable
7985205 the company has to do this at some level to align their cost structure to the reality of what is going on in the fuel market
7985206 how much do you think this cut is worth it is pretty great no

7985225 ayurveda experts in india believe that if bhasmas are properly prepared according to ancient protocols the metals undergo shodhana purification rendering them non toxic and therapeutic

7985346 with retrospect the notion of an alternative magazine is as preposterous as an alternative arms manufacturer or a counter cultural oil company it is a consumerist medium hopeless to deny it

7985377 as an ardent practicing catholic abortion is an issue that i have studied for a long time
7985378 since it must be treated from conception as a person the embryo must be defended in its integrity cared for and healed as far as possible like any other human being
7985379 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7985380 the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law

7985392 the extreme anti choice language in the 2008 platform represents the smallest faction of what is truly a big tent party and ignores the beliefs of the vast majority of republicans as demonstrated by recent poll results
7985393 the mainstream majority of republican voters and even most gop candidates do not embrace these extreme positions we are enormously saddened and disappointed that the party missed a major opportunity to transform the gop into a big tent differentiate ourselves from the bush administration and reach out to millions of voters who have been alienated because of the narrow positions stated in this platform
7985394 an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
7985395 i condemn russias decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states and call upon all countries of the world not to accord any legitimacy to this action
7985396 the united states should call for a meeting of the united nations security council to condemn russias decision in coordination with our european allies the u s should lead within the un and other international forums to cast a clear and unrelenting light on the decision and to further isolate russia internationally because of its actions the osce must also send a serious monitoring group to georgia

7985402 rather than lamenting the noise commonly found in the material culture at the margins of social units we should take advantage of this ambiguity in considering the implications of cross cutting social networks and the creolization of cultural constructs 488
7985403 people living along a border tribal linguistic or other are often quite likely to interact with people on the other side and are indeed more likely to interact with foreigners who are close by than with their own people who are at a greater distance the effect of these social relationships was to ensure that people in a border area were apt to have relatives across the border that is people who had married into the next tribal or linguistic group this clearly provided the social mechanism for contact and trade across tribal and linguistic boundaries once through the border zone introduced goods and ideas had little difficulty in diffusing internally within the homogeneous tribal territory boundary arbitration through intermarriage would tend to create haziness in and along border areas there would tend to be a hybridization of material items of the two groups in contact this discontinuity in the material record might be useful in identifying the location of the border

7985406 hes a man of immense maturity and unmatched in the senate certainly and probably much more widely as an analyst and advocate in the foreign policy and defence policy areas
7985407 she has the ability to bring the delegates along and give them some inspiration
7985408 i thought clintons concession speech was amazing and i think she has the ability to do the same thing tonight
7985409 in talking with the clinton supporters in the delegation there still some sense of intense disappointment i havent heard anyone say they arent going to stop obama when its all done but they were really looking forward to being clinton supporting delegates and nominating for the first time a female candidate for president
7985410 the first thing that happened was that the russian tanks came in
7985411 a sniper war had begun six people died in one day
7985412 one side would use a 60mm mortar the other side would use a 90mm then the 122s came out
7985413 i would like to address those who are now shooting at georgian policemen i want to say with full responsibility that several hours ago i reached a very difficult decision not to respond with fire
7985414 in the evening the ossetians started firing our side did not shoot he says
7985415 and then they bombed our village the ossetians began to bomb they had weapons from the russians it began on the evening of the 7th and continued the entire night
7985416 we had only just turned off the camera lights when the first shots were fired from heavy artillery it was 23 30
7985417 i am sickened by the speculation that georgia started anything
7985418 we clearly responded to the russians the point here is that around 11 oclock russian tanks started to move into georgian territory 150 at first and that was a clear cut invasion that was the moment when we started to open fire with artillery because otherwise they would have crossed the bridge and moved into tskhinvali
7985419 i was in fact told that russian armour was indeed already moving toward the georgian village of kurta from the roki tunnel before the georgians attacked tskhinvali
7985420 despite our call for peace and a unilateral ceasefire separatists continued the shelling of georgian villages we had demanded that that they sit at the negotiating table but all of this was met with a backwards reaction and there was constant shooting the georgian power wielding bodies decided to restore constitutional order throughout the whole region
7985421 i did indeed advise the georgian leadership not to get drawn into a trap that was our consistent advice for several years
7985422 i am quite convinced there was no green light there was definitely a problem with an insufficiently red light
7985423 in accordance with the right to self defence on the afternoon of august 8 russia sent additional forces to south ossetia to support russian peacekeepers and protect civilians
7985424 we were called to react to alarm on the night of 7th they had wanted to send us for field training in a different region there was such an escalation of events that i cannot remember exactly when we entered the tunnel we did not enter until after the georgians had begun fighting
7985425 it is now perfectly clear to me that the russian incursion into georgia was planned in advance and a definitive political decision to complete the preparation and start a war in august was apparently made back in april
7985426 if a war has been planned a pretext can always be found
7985427 it was the russian assault that destroyed the town we couldnt have done that
7985428 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
7985429 lidea pi assurda e ridicola come se io potessi mai trovare il modo di esistere senza aver bisogno di te
7985430 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
7985431 its important that no one gets left behind we can pay attention respond the best way we can in terms of the resources we can muster together for long term recovery to meet those needs
7985432 to me thats just a lot for a seven year old
7985433 because of having to get up shes going to burn herself out
7985434 it makes it tough to transport students all over this town
7985435 the buses are a little fuller longer but in the long run saved the district quite a bit of money
7985436 hai idea di quanto importante tu sia per me riesci a renderti conto di quanto ti amo
7985437 i was thinking it was going to come in my apartment
7985438 it just happens every time we get a real fast hard rain in 30 or 15 minutes it washes away in sewer and its gone
7985439 two inches of rain in less than hour it just overwhelmed the system it was a lot rain for the system to handle
7985440 ive seen every thing from brush to leaves to grass clippings put in the drain system and we would really like to encourage people that it does impede the flow and functionality of system
7985441 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro lorizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
7985442 faceva parte della bugia amore mio non sono mai riuscito a cancellare lagonia il mio cuore non batteva da quasi novantanni ma stavolta andato diversamente non lo sentivo pi al suo posto cera un vuoto come se ti fossi portata via tutto ci che avevo dentro
7985443 la morte che libato il miele del tuo respiro nulla ha potuto ancora sulla tua bellezza
7985444 gt gt mormor e riconobbi i versi pronunciati da romeo sulla tomba di giulietta
7985445 non esattamente sono io stessa a darmi fastidio il mio volto cos facile da leggere mia madre dice sempre che sono un libro aperto
7985446 al contrario per me tu sei molto difficile da leggere
7985447 ho detto che sarebbe meglio che non diventassi amici non che non voglio
7985448 sarebbe pi prudente che tu non diventassi mia amica ma sono stanco di costringermi ad evitarti bella
7985449 ho pensato che se proprio devo andare allinferno tanto vale andarci in grande stile
7985450 credo che i tuoi amici siano arrabbiati con me perch ti ho rapita
7985451 no pi che altro sorpresa a cosa devo tutto questo
7985452 telho detto sono stanco di sforzarmi di starti lontano perci ci rinuncio
7985453 si rinuncio a sforzarmi di fare il bravo dora in poi far solo ci che mi va e mi prender quel che viene
7985454 e se non fossi il supereroe se fossi il cattivo
7985455 non dovresti trattare cos le persone non per niente corretto
7985456 abbacinarle in quel modo per fare colpo probabilmente corsa in cucina a cercare di riprendere fiato
7985457 e dai non dirmi che non ti rendi conto delleffetto che fai
7985458 non te ne sei accorto pensi che chiunque sia capace di fare quel che desidera cos facilmente
7985459 non ridere se te lo chiedo ma come fai a uscire di casa quando giorno
7985460 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui
7985461 sei davvero convinta di piacermi meno di quanto io piaccia a te
7985462 si mi vuoi rispondere o si ne sei davvero convinta
7985463 probabilmente no ma allultimo momento avrei cancellato linvito avrei finto una malattia o una caviglia slogata
7985464 immagino che tu non mi abbia mai visto in palestra ma pensavo che avresti capito
7985465 ti riferisci al fatto che non sei in grado di camminare su una superficie piana e solida senza inciampare
7985466 e il crepuscolo per noi il momento pi scuro della giornata lora pi leggera ma in un certo senso anche la pi triste la fine di un altro giorno il ritorno della notte loscurit fin troppo prevedibile non credi
7985467 a me la notte piace se non ci fosse il buio non vedremmo le stelle b non che qui si vedano un granch
7985468 avevo paura perch per ecco ovvi motivi non posso stare con te ma daltro canto vorrei stare con te molto molto pi del lecito
7985469 si non c dubbio una paura legittima voler stare con me e tutto fuorch una scelta vantaggiosa
7985470 avrei dovuto lasciarti perdere tempo fa dovrei lasciarti adesso ma non so se ci riuscirei
7985471 il che precisamente la migliore ragione per andarmene ma non preoccuparti sono una creatura troppo egoista desidero troppo la tua compagnia per comportarmi come dovrei
7985472 bella arriverei a odiare me stesso se dovessi farti del male non hai idea di che tormento sia stato il pensiero di te immobile bianca fredda di non vederti pi avvampare di rossore di non poter pi cogliere la scintilla nel tuo sguardo quando capisci che ti sto prendendo in giro non sarei in grado di sopportarlo ora sei la cosa pi importante per me la cosa pi importante di tutta la mia vita
7985473 sai gi cosa provo ovviamente sono qui il che in due parole significa che preferirei morire piuttosto che rinunciare a te sono unidiota
7985474 sciocca correre per me un gesto automatico non qualcosa a cui devo stare attento
7985475 non prendertela con te stessa se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
7985476 e domani sar pi difficile ora sono assuefatto alla presenza costante del tuo odore se ti resto lontano troppo a lungo mi toccher ricominciare da capo non proprio da zero per
7985477 stavi dormendo sodo non mi sono perso niente i discorsi li avevi gi fatti
7985478 ma cosa devo fare con te la prima volta che ti bacio mi assali la seconda mi svieni tra le braccia
7985479 a vedere una partita di baseball non mi sembra che tu abbia pi tanta voglia di giocare ma sono certa che gli altri si divertiranno anche senza di te
7985480 non sono mai arrabbiato con te come potrei esserlo sei sempre cos coraggiosa fiduciosa calorosa
7985481 ci che mi fa infuriare limpossibilit di proteggerti dai rischi la mia stessa presenza un rischio per te a volte mi odio dal profondo dovrei essere pi forte capace di
7985482 ti amo e una giustificazione banale per quanto faccio ma sincera
7985483 bella bella smettila ti preoccupi per le cose sbagliate credimi se ti dico che nessuno di noi rischia niente sei gi abbastanza sotto pressione non caricarti del peso di preoccupazioni superflue ascoltami la nostra famiglia forte lunica paura che abbiamo quella di perderti
7985484 edward rimasto solo per quasi un secolo ora ha trovato te dopo tutti questi anni passati assieme a lui certi cambiamenti non ci sfuggono e lui diverso adesso pensi che avremmo il coraggio di guardarlo in faccia per i prossimi centanni se ti perde
7985485 lo so bella credimi lo so e come se ti fossi portata via met di me stesso
7985486 ci credi se ti dico che malgrado tutto quello che ti sto facendo ti amo anche io
7985487 per aver rischiato di sparire dalla mia vita per sempre
7985488 non ce lho con billy e suo figlio a irritarmi
7985489 prima di tutto mi ha costretto a violare la mia promessa avevo promesso che stasera non ti avrei mollata neanche per un secondo
7985490 grazie ma c dellaltro ha detto che sei carina il che praticamente un insulto stasera sei molto pi che bellissima
7985491 di nuovo il crepuscolo unaltra fine ogni giorno deve finire anche il pi perfetto
7985492 non proprio pi che altro sogno di restare con te per sempre
7985493 stammi a sentire ti amo pi di qualsiasi altra cosa al mondo senza eccezioni non ti basta
7985494 e allora preparati alla fine preparati al crepuscolo della tua vita appena iniziata preparati a rinunciare a tutto
7985495 se la vita ti offre un sogno che supera qualsiasi tua aspettativa non giusto lamentrasi perch alla fine si conclude
7985496 mentre li studiavo il pi giovane dei cullen alz lo sguardo e incroci il mio e stavolta la sua espressione era evidentemente incuriosita mi voltai di scatto e allora mi sembr di notare che il ragazzo fosse stranamente sorpeso quasi deluso
7985497 per un interminabile istante il silenzio fu assoluto poi iniziarono le urla in quel pandemonio sentivo gridare il mio nome dappertutto ma nitida in mezzo al frastuono vicina al mio orecchio udii la voce bassa e affannata di edward cullen
7985498 bevitori di sangue la tua gente li chiama vampiri hai la pelle doca
7985499 e sbagliato e rischio bella io sono pericoloso ti prego renditene conto
7985500 anchio te lho detto non mimporta cosa sei e troppo tardi
7985501 sedevo l il viso cinereo e gli occhi sbarrati un uccellino ipnotizzato dallo sguardo di un serpente
7985502 non avere paura prometto giuro che non ti far del male non avere paura per favore perdonami sono capace di controllarmi mi hai preso in contropiede ma adesso ar impeccabile
7985503 e stato a quel punto che hai rischiato di morire schiacciata nellincidente proprio sotto i miei occhi
7985504 si accucci con il volto appoggiato dolcemente al mio petto ascoltava il mio cuore gli sfugg un sospiro non so per quanto tempo restammo immobili in quella posizione ore intere per qul che mi sembrava sapevo che avrebbe potuto perdere il controllo in qualsiasi momento e la mia vita sarebbe finita l eppure non riuscivo a provare paura sentivo il contatto con lui e non pensavo ad altro
7985505 corsi alla finestra laprii e mi sporsi nelloscurit della sera a scrutare le ombre impernetrabili degli alberi
7985506 dammi solo un minuto per rimettere in moto il cuore
7985507 incrociammo i nostri sguardi attenti la sua espressione si fece pi rilassata ma allo stesso tempo perplessa
7985508 e poi nel sonno ti ho sentita pronuinciare il mio nome tanto chiaramente da farmi credere che ti fossi svegliata ti sei rigirata nel letto hai mormorato di nuovo il mio nome e sospirato quel momento mi ha sbolrdito e segnato ho capito che non avrei pi potuto ignorarti
7985509 non mi sembra affatto giusto io non ho dovuto aspettare nemmeno un seccondo perch dovrebbe andarmi cos liscia
7985510 hai ragione dopotutto sei soltanto costretta a rischiare la vita ogni secondo che passi assiaeme a me e non un granch ti tocca soltanto voltare le spalle alla natura allumanit cosa vuoi che sia
7985511 pochissimo non mi sembra di dover sopportare una gran rinuncia
7985512 e sei preoccupata non perch stai per conoscere una famiglia di vampiri ma perch temi che questi vampiri non ti approveranno giusto
7985513 la musica rallent si trasform in qualcosa di pi morbido e con grande sorpresa
7985514 vuoi che blocchi le uscite cos potete massacrare gli ignari cittadini
7985515 hai idea di quanto importante tu sia per me riesci a renderti conto di quanto ti amo
7985516 avrei dovuto lasciarti tempo fa dovrei lasciarti adesso ma non so se ci riuscirei
7985517 il che precisamente la miglior ragione per andarmene ma non preoccuarti sono una creatura essenzalmente egoista desidero troppo la tua compagnia per comportarmi come dovrei
7985518 non esserlo non solo la tua compagnia che amo non dimenticarlo mai non dimenticare mai che sono pi pericoloso per te che per chiunque altro
7985519 vorrei vorrei sentissi la complessit la confusione che provo vorrei che potessi comprendere
7985520 e sei preoccupata non perch stai per conoscere una famiglia di vampiri ma perch temi che questi vampiri non ti approveranno giusto

7985537 we kept it nice and tight we got that early goal everything was going perfectly but there was going to be some stage when we had to push forward and get that second goal
7985538 unfortunately they caught us on the break there and punished us back to 1 1

7985560 i did say that it would be from a high vantage point and that it would be with the named rifle
7985561 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads

7985572 many arrests are due to behavior caused by excessive drinking
7985573 i think that in their country they are like prisoners and they want to feel free
7985574 its because of british culture no one can relax so they become inebriated to be the people they want to be
7985575 when things do go wrong they go wrong in quite a big way
7985576 what were trying to do here is reduce some of these avoidable accidents where they have so much to drink that they fall off balconies and are either killed or need huge operations

7985594 gustav represents a real and potentially dangerous storm for the entire gulf energy production region
7985595 gustav is the forerunner of what could become a very nasty hurricane season for the u s
7985596 we are making logistical arrangements to evacuate staff who are not essential to production or drilling operations
7985597 is going to be nothing more than a speed bump
7985598 theres a lot of warm water ahead of it theres a lot of fuel for it its definitely a concern
7985599 any disruption will also have a big impact on winter
7985600 were not going to do nearly 1 trillion cubic feet
7985601 it could be five or six days before it gets to the gulf and it still has to move through a lot of land mass
7985602 this technology significantly reduces fuel oil and natural gas consumption
7985603 we really think this is a game changer for the renewables industry

7985606 still a long way from oil and gas infrastructure but gas traders will be keenly focused on direction magnitude of this summers first storm to potentially impact energy markets

7985608 as an ardent practicing catholic abortion is an issue that i have studied for a long time
7985609 since it must be treated from conception as a person the embryo must be defended in its integrity cared for and healed as far as possible like any other human being
7985610 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7985611 the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
7985612 i am so glad that i found trivita as a strong business model to follow their idea of buying customers maps instead of the usual way of conducting a network marketing business by buying leads has produced such a rich roi that i cannot see myself pursuing any online business in another way
7985613 trivita is not just another home business deal it is a real way to improve your business profitability the roi on money invested will become much more substantial if one follows the guidelines set forth by trivita and consistently buy customers each month

7985621 millions of americans suffer from problem or pathological gambling that can destroy families we support legislation prohibiting gambling over the internet or in student athletics by student athletes who are participating in competitive sports
7985622 they republicans are just doing this to win an election they have continually shot down legislation that was offered up to regulate internet gambling now they are going to pretend that those votes didnt happen people had better be cautious about taking them at their word
7985623 as far as granting our motion evidently the judge has granted our motion but has stopped short of laying out exactly how the nigc should go about enforcing it

7985626 their use of force against south ossetia clearly dashed all of those previous resolutions and created a completely new reality

7985628 connoisseurs and the general public alike have been dazzled by the beauty of her soft and natural voice which is equally supple in every register and exudes sensitivity in every tone

7985634 we kept it nice and tight we got that early goal everything was going perfectly but there was going to be some stage when we had to push forward and get that second goal

7985640 instead of just typing hotels in washington did you want hotels in washington dc or hotels in washington state dont remember that song title or persons name let google help you search
7985641 ive always found that rather google show some metric related to how popular that suggested query is since thats the basis of why youre being shown these words
7985642 over at microsofts live search you dont get query suggestions when typing in the search box but they will show related searches links in the top right hand corner of search results in some cases
7985643 the fed must husband its resources carefully from this point on as it has already tied up more than half of its balance sheet in new liquidity initiatives

7985645 i went back home to my familys place in washington state and literally three weeks after mgs4 launched we were hit with some pretty heavy news concerning my mom
7985646 so this past month i decided to leave kojima productions and look to continue my career working closer to my family in north america
7985647 its not easy leaving my other family the mgs team but with everybody taking time off and not having any other big projects to shift focus to it feels like this is how its supposed to be its fate
7985648 but ive got the utmost confidence that hideo kojima ken imaizumi and our amazing team will put together another blockbuster game ill be cheering from the sidelines
7985649 she looks like shed be terrible at thingy putting too
7985650 life is a bitch and she is back in heat
7985651 its at this moment that the early big moment happened just to repeat the cops were caging these kids in tighter and tighter so a tall guy makes what seems to be a break for it and thats where i happened to be in a good place for a very clear view due to our alley detour i was standing about fifteen feet from what happened and it happened in such a quick blink of an eye that youd miss it if you sneezed my excuse for not having a photo is because just as i hit the shutter i swallowed in a gulp of pepper spray that misted through the air forcing me to recoil and lose the shot but ill happily go in a court of law to say i saw a guy with no weapons run at a bunch of police immediately get shot with rubber bullets and then receive what looked very much like a pistol whipping the sound of clattering metal billyclubs on the pavement indicating missed shots is something i dont think ill ever forget either

7985659 when i was a young woman your vagina was neither seen nor heard not unless you did pussy farts in a freak show
7985660 hey gimme a break im jewish i was brought up to believe that even thinking about such acts was asking for god to strike you dead with a lightning bolt
7985661 but suppose a young good looking guy walked up to you today and said miss rivers it has long been my ambition to eat you out would you let him
7985662 jeez is that the kind of dialogue you write for british tv shows i guess if hes really set his heart on it i wouldnt stop him but only when im safely under the covers and no torch he has to burrow like a mole searching for a hole let him use his sense of smell

7985674 this minority parliament is increasingly reaching an impasse on a range of issues
7985675 there are indications that it wont be possible to have a fruitful session due to the deadlock that exists between us and the opposition on many files
7985676 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty
7985677 it is not a matter of polls the polls are not particularly wonderful
7985678 it is a matter of my responsibility as prime minister to make a decision on whether i think that the fall session of parliament can be productive
7985679 if i dont think it can be productive then obviously it is my responsibility to make sure that the people can elect a parliament to proceed
7985680 spending weeks and weeks playing telephone tag with opposition leaders doesnt help me to confirm that things will be productive
7985681 this prime minister is inventing reasons to try to trigger an election and break his word
7985682 wants to go into an election now before canadians see how much he is ill prepared to face the difficulties of the slowing economy before canadians discover all the problems of ethics of his government before we all see the bad results he will have at the next by elections

7985710 there is a lot obama could have done to unify the party and basically he hasnt lifted a finger
7985711 feels like the obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments
7985712 and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process sen obama would go a long way towards healing these wounds if he were to specifically praise the accomplishments of the clinton presidency in a line or two during his speech on thursday
7985713 yes theres some scabs but sometimes underneath a scab theres a little bit of pus but we have to put some disinfectant on it so we that can heal the wound and move forward thats what the convention is about

7985717 her challenge is to make the most of the emotion without popping the roof off
7985718 she wants to reassert her relevance and introduce a new political identity
7985719 i think she understands that if she runs again she has to run a different style of campaign
7985720 and shes got a huge opening right now for the first time in her career she actually has a base to invigorate at the beginning of the 08 campaign she was the issue she had to explain herself her celebrity now shes got a base the working class and she needs to speak to them

7985724 the currency is really the last tool in the box
7985725 in any normal economy youd already see inflation numbers much higher than the official numbers say it is
7985726 china will forthrightly continue to push forward the reform of the flexibility of the renminbi exchange rate

7985751 there are some who think it will be harder for america to accept a black first lady than a black male president
7985752 sometimes it seems that many americans fear a black first lady more than a merely half white president
7985753 i am the son of a black man from kenya and a white woman from kansas
7985754 i am married to a black american who carries within her the blood of slaves and slave owners an inheritance we pass on to our two precious daughters
7985755 in america the enslaved african woman became the basis for our societys other
7985756 gender is probably the most restricting force in american life whether the question is who must be in the kitchen or who could be in the white house
7985757 the combined discrimination of being 1 black 2 female and 3 poor may be greater than the sum of each of the three parts
7985758 un deserving of the courtesy and esteem automatically bestowed on white women
7985759 polarized woman into the clustering of images goodness and light with virginity and evil and darkness with sexuality
7985760 reified and confirmed when white planters owned black slave women
7985761 for as perpetuator of white superiority legitimate line and as a creature absolutely inaccessible to the males of the inferior group she inevitably became the focal center of the fundamental pattern of proto dorian pride
7985762 it was no accident that the most articulate spokesmen for slavery were also eloquent exponents of the subordinate role of women
7985763 nevertheless white southern women internalized the mythology of the southern feminine mystique and reveled in the power it granted them over their black subordinates both male and female 5
7985764 just as the cult of white womanhood in the south served to preserve a labor and social system based on race distinctions so did the cult of the lady in an egalitarian society serve as a means of preserving class distinctions
7985765 the women of the newly middle and upper classes could use their newly gained time for leisure pursuits they became ladies
7985766 a more welcome resource to some thousands of young women unwilling to give themselves to domestic service

7985920 obama spokesman tommy vietor said obama supporters have inundated stations that are airing the ad many of them owned by sinclair communications with 93 000 e mails he called the ad false despicable and outrageous

7985953 i was kind of afraid of obama the first time i saw him
7985954 i thought ive been burned by guys like you before
7985955 ive been burned by politicians before that i wanted to believe in and just didnt live up to it
7985956 and i was afraid to trust him and i was afraid to have hope when i first kind of became aware of him
7985957 around the time that he gave his speech on race
7985958 i just said i cant deny how i feel about you barack obama
7985959 i think that not only can barack cause change because thats where his heart lies as a true american success story he understands how hard it is and when he says that he will when people come to him with problems hes been there
7985960 i just heard the other day he just paid off his student loans two years ago
7985961 he inspires us to be the best americans we can be and i think if hes president when hes president i should say were going to find people changing on the inside and once we all have hope for the future i think youre going to find everyones going to wake up and take control of this amazing moment where theres so many things that need help and people will all be inspired to help

7985971 coal burning leaves toxic heavy metal legacy in the arctic
7985972 conventional wisdom held that toxic heavy metals were higher in the 1960s and 70s the peak of industrial activity in europe and north america and certainly before implementation of clean air act controls in the early 1970s
7985973 but it turns out pollution in southern greenland was higher 100 years ago when north american and european economies ran on coal before the advent of cleaner more efficient coal burning technologies and the switch to oil and gas based economies
7985974 contamination of other sectors may be increasing because of the rapid coal driven growth of asian economies

7986186 and each generation needs to explore the history of the past to understand fully the context in which these polar extremes come into clashes with one another so history of how we dealt with these problems in the 1940s and 1950s is a current history and a history that is very important for us to understand
7986187 confidence is still quite depressed but its a glimmer of hope from the lows we saw in june
7986188 i attribute the increase to the drop in gasoline prices which offset a deteriorating labor market
7986189 consumer confidence readings suggest the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year
7986190 the data today paint a mixed picture but its clear it will still take some time to work through the downturn in housing
7986191 sat on the sidelines opposing and delaying urgent reforms to our housing markets
7986192 as our housing market continues to struggle barack obamas plans for tax increases and government spending will cost jobs at a time when we need them most
7986193 the next president must bring to office a clear eyed view of our nations role in the world as the defender of the oppressed and a force for peace
7986194 in the end confusion about such questions only invites more trouble violence and aggression
7986195 now i missed a few years of the cold war as a guest of one of our adversaries but as i recall the world was deeply divided during the cold war between the side of freedom and the side of tyranny
7986196 the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
7986197 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
7986198 if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright

7986204 american businesses and consumers were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
7986205 the overall mood is still one of caution theres not much out there to get investors excited
7986206 but the bigger picture is that there hasnt really been a major breakdown considering all the bad headlines out there from higher oil prices to the credit crisis and troubled housing sector
7986207 im sure theres going to be a rather difficult period in our discussions
7986208 if it goes in the direction of aggravating relations its not going to be our choice but i want to remind you that cold war was a completely different beast when we were really at each others throats in a big way internationally and this is not going to happen under any circumstances
7986209 their use of force against south ossetia clearly dashed all of those previous resolutions and created a completely new reality
7986210 first of all you see where the florida delegation is seated on the floor theyre seated right next to the illinois and delaware delegations so i think thats your issue all of that is behind us we are unified now

7986220 democrats around this country are united we will elect barack obama president of the united states though she did not get her partys nomination i believe in many ways hillary clinton came out of that nominating process a winner she showed the world that a woman can compete at the highest levels of power in american politics hillary you make us proud
7986221 republicans stood in the way of progress so were going to stand up for democrats around this country in 2008 were going to elect a working democratic majority to help barack obama make change
7986222 if youre excited about electing barack obama president and i know you are dont forget to vote for other democrats because barack needs bigger majorities

7986250 regeringen f rer i forvejen en ekspansiv politik vi vil f re en stram konomisk politik som er det rigtige i lyset af konjunkturerne i forhold til nogle af de meldinger fra partierne om at bruge l s og pumpe flere milliarder ud jamen vi har jo ikke h nderne til det
7986251 i betragtning af at vi ved hvilken v rkt jskasse vi skal gribe efter synes jeg ikke man svarer p de her ting
7986252 der vil vi komme med konkrete forslag til reformer vi vil gerne s ge indflydelse p de forskellige ting

7986294 we make every effort to comply with all state and federal regulations that govern events such as receptions entertainment etc for candidates and elected officials
7986295 largely have failed to make the nominating conventions more respectable political events
7986296 the conventions have become mostly privately financed soirees funded by corporations and lobbying firms that seek favors from the federal government

7986317 women are caught in the middle of a dysfunctional system doctors are telling them they need surgery even when they dont and insurance companies who are tired of paying the bill for so many frivolous surgeries are punishing women for the poor medical care of doctors

7986481 the nations only organization that recruit mccain obama wrong on worlds lessons republican candidate john mccain said tuesday that barack obama lacks clarity about the lessons of iraq and the cold war challenging
7986482 he inspires us to be the best americans we can be
7986483 and i think if hes president when hes preside kennedy michelle obama urge party to unite as mccain closes record searchlight denver ailing and aging sen
7986484 i know that i love him i know that much
7986485 were just not going to rush anything were gonna walk through the process however slowly it needs to happen in order for the healing and restoration to be complete and then well go from there
7986486 im actually seeking professional counselling myself i need to be able to unravel a lot of emotion thats bombarding me at the moment i owe it to myself to work through that properly and to him
7986487 i had questions after the shock of it all but my initial thoughts after hearing that were a sense of sorrow for the church and that a lot of people were going to be hurt because of it
7986488 i was the first one he told he confessed everything to me
7986489 he just went through it where it had started everything in his life as a young kid the patterns he was crying sobbing actually absolutely sobbing he just said i dont have cancer
7986490 he was terrified i still remember the look on his face it was a very hard moment for him as it was for me hearing it
7986491 this is who i am im addicted to the stuff it consumes my mind
7986492 itinerate minister who held a credential with the australian christian churches
7986493 the national executive of the acc is taking this matter very seriously and is awaiting the results of the medical tests before determining the full extent of the discipline that will be imposed upon him
7986494 michael guglielmucci has not been a paid staff member of edge church for eight years
7986495 michael has lived in three other states of australia since leaving us and has been a minister on staff in two other churches since leaving our employ
7986496 he has not received any money from edge church international toward his alleged medical expenses
7986497 hell take the shot if hes open hes a team player who improves the people around him and he wont back down from any challenge
7986498 i tell people that i dont play golf or tennis or anything i just play politics
7986499 he said i was convicted of a felony in 1994 which is grounds for deportation
7986500 ive worked 12 years steady job just trying to do provide for my family and do the right thing this is a shock to me i never thought in a million years id end up like this
7986501 if i cant get out of jail theres no point in me staying in here for a year to fight a case
7986502 we must note with bitterness the threat of a progressive deterioration in the climate of confidence and cooperation that should characterize relations between nations the recent events have weakened the confidence in many that such experiences had been consigned to the past
7986503 rather than by the christian memory and heritage of the vast majority of member states
7986504 powers outside the caucasus region should not seek excuses for tensions and instability in the crisis area
7986505 the key point is we are a long way from bottoming out
7986506 here i have to reveal a trade secret which punctures the mystique of intelligence analysis generally speaking 80 of the information one needs to form judgments on key intelligence targets or issues is available in open media
7986507 in his usual form former un weapons inspector scott ritter told a packed crowd to stop whining about corporate media and become their own intelligence operatives we the people have the same resources and tools that intelligence networks rely heavily on its called google as our own intelligence operatives we cant allow cnn fox nbc and abc to edit and cherry pick information but ask questions and find the answers ourselves
7986508 many apparently separate developing daily events dont make the slightest sense if you dont look at them in their strategic context in the face of orwellian control of the media it is even more necessary to judge contemporary developments with the eye of an historian who has not forgotten the lessons of history
7986509 i have gotten a couple of calls from the yard saying that they have kegs there we could go pick them up
7986510 i think it reflects the economy absolutely people stealing cooper things like that they are doing to take what they can take for additional cash
7986511 weve identified some safety upgrades to the parapet walls and we want to move on it as soon as possible state transportation secretary john d porcari said
7986512 having lane closures and bridge construction work over a holiday weekend is highly unusual and will certainly cause some motorists delays but we applaud the secretary and the maryland transportation authority for proceeding with these safety improvements
7986513 the decision to enter into this agreement is consistent with our long held view that the repurchase of our shares is a very attractive use of excess capital furthermore using internal capital to purchase our shares reflects our confidence in aflacs overall financial position despite the turmoil of todays capital markets the overall credit profile of our investment portfolio is very favorable and our capital adequacy ratios in the united states and japan remain strong in addition to our confidence in aflacs balance sheet strength we continue to believe we are well positioned to achieve our objectives for earnings per share growth we expect to achieve our goal for 2008 of a 14 to 15 increase in operating earnings per share excluding the impact of foreign currency our objective for 2009 is to increase operating earnings per share 13 to 15 excluding the impact of foreign currency with the timing of the repurchase under this agreement occurring in late 2008 and early next year we are even more confident we will achieve next years earnings objective
7986514 we are excited to report record high revenues which exceeded our previous estimate
7986515 we thank andrew for his contribution and wish him every success in the future
7986516 as mr shao has been with us since the beginning of nepstars rapid expansion and has been instrumental to our financial management and internal control we look forward to a smooth transition

7986548 but i have the same access to health care that someone who makes more money has
7986549 yes its expensive you know its a big chunk of your monthly income
7986550 but considering what you can get for it its worth it
7986551 he says for himself or for us the health care system in the united states is the major reason why we have never moved there and never will move there because both of us have chronic illnesses that have to have a lot of medical attention and we would go broke
7986552 its also the no 1 reason in the united states that people personally go bankrupt
7986553 because for kids everything is free the drugs its always free
7986554 the general opinion in germany is always that the government will do it for us everything will be ok

7986587 developing and vitalizing open and affirming churches that not only welcome lgbt people in but also reach outside their congregations makes a difference in both church and society this investment from the haas jr fund makes it possible for the coalition to build the internal systems that make more effective the hundreds of our volunteers who participate in the movement for lgbt rights
7986588 as a national grassroots movement working for lgbt equality in the presbyterian church usa and civil society since 1974 we have been able to accomplish much as a nearly all volunteer network with one full time staff person the funding from the evelyn and walter haas jr fund allows more light presbyterians to build capacity and take our next steps as an organization and network by hiring additional staff
7986589 we stand at the threshold of accomplishing policy change and ending discrimination against lgbt persons and their families in the presbyterian church usa as we enter a national campaign to ratify the recent legislative victory at the 218th general assembly of the presbyterian church usa this grant makes it possible for more light presbyterians to create this national campaign

7986595 i believe she has lost many obama supporters and she has lost the african american community forever
7986596 the vaticans decision to move cardinal newmans body from its resting place is an act of grave robbery and religious desecration it violates newmans repeated wish to be buried for eternity with his life long partner ambrose st john
7986597 they have been together for more than 100 years and the vatican wants to disturb that peace to cover up the fact that cardinal newman loved a man its shameful dishonourable betrayal of newman by the gay hating catholic church
7986598 it was great of the president to speak about the issue
7986599 dont fear resist and do not compromise on that it is a danger not only to the believers but to the whole of africa it is bad if our children become complacent and think that people who are not in order are alright
7986600 when he speaks in this manner to the bishops it will energise the resolve against homosexuality
7986601 much has been done and fulfilled in the areas of basic christian education and strengthening the local church ministry training support for local churchs and diocesan programs and self support
7986602 he has made huge impacts on improving the life and development of the church by helping communities achieve their basic needs to have better rural water supplies around malaita improved human resource development and leadership training as well as infrastructure development in the main centers of the diocese

7986610 i first got the idea to do the film when i visited the plain of jars in laos in 2002
7986611 you could still see the craters from the air bombing and unexploded ordnance was everywhere then i heard about long chen and the fact that no one had got there since the war and i thought how do i visit and how do i make a film about it
7986612 i found it bizarre that at one time this was the second biggest city in laos and it was completely secret
7986613 laos was the progenitor of the way america fights wars in the 21st century
7986614 outsourcing the war to private companies gathering public support by falsifying intelligence and documents embedded journalism and automated warfare including the use of so called smart weapons all these methods were first tested in laos
7986615 the cia had just declassified a whole lot of material so that helped as well
7986616 the most important source was the guys who were over there filming with their little super 8 cameras often illegally
7986617 we destroyed a whole civilization we wiped it off the map we incinerated atomized human remains in this air war and what happened in the end we lost
7986618 after we went another uk crew tried to get there but they were caught and deported
7986619 its just an army outpost now a small village a couple of hundred people soldiers and their families
7986620 there are some places in the world that have a different energy and long chen is one of these you look down the runway and think this is the place were it all happened the planes took off from here and bombed all those people
7986621 the golden age of long chen is over it used to be the high tech oasis for spooks in laos there were allegedly more antennas there than trees now they do not even have power
7986622 there are still some groups but they are not organized they are certainly not politically or militarily organized they are remnants the children and grandchildren of those involved in the war who are scared to come out of the jungle because they have never known anything else
7986623 whether vang pao is guilty or not of the charges he is facing one thing that is true is that he and other expatriate hmong have used these people as pawns
7986624 i do not see that happening in the next few years it is still far too sensitive on the part of the lao government
7986625 they are also keen not to risk unsettling relations with the americans by opening it up it is the last chapter of the vietnam war and both governments have an interest in making sure it is forgotten
7986626 muchos estudiantes en especial los que son pobres saben instuitivamente qu hacen por ellos las escuelas los adiestran a confundir
7986627 theres a chance i might wait for a long time
7986628 thats up to we as a staff to talk about not quite sure
7986629 whats a blackshirt mean if its just a symbol you havent earned isnt that the point i think thats the point and everybody wants to rush this thing its the same way when i was here the first time i dont see the point in handing them out to hand them out
7986630 despite the serious injuries he was even conscious when we found him he could not speak but he sat on a stool and made himself understood through gestures
7986631 an increase in some types of lung cancer and cancers of the upper respiratory tract such as throat and mouth cancer
7986632 contains cancer causing chemicals such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons carbonyls and benzene which cause mutations to dna in human cells
7986633 how much they used incense and collected detailed information on their lifestyle including their diet and how much they drank alcohol and smoked
7986634 325 had developed cancer of the upper respiratory tract and 821 had developed lung cancer
7986635 the small risk of developing upper respiratory tract cancers nearly doubled in people who used incense regularly
7986636 whether grazing or resting these animals face either magnetic north or south
7986637 our results call for an in depth study of this phenomenon and challenge neuroscientists biochemists and physicists to study the proximate mechanisms and biological significance of magnetic alignment
7986638 birds turtles and salmon are known to use the earths magnetic field to guide their migrations while rodents and one bat species have been found to possess an internal magnetic compass
7986639 sleep in an east west position have far shorter rapid eye movement or rem sleep cycles compared with north south sleepers who got more rem sleep
7986640 there is absolutely nothing to link hari puttar with harry potter

7986642 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7986643 in the face of the existing situation a decision was required
7986644 this is not an easy choice but this is the only possible way to save peoples lives
7986645 what russia is doing against the sovereignty of georgia refers to europe too georgian media outlets reported state minister for reintegration temur iakobashvili as saying
7986646 human rights violation and the eviction of the peaceful population from their homes must not be ignored
7986647 it is not possible for one second for georgia to live on its knees
7986648 ensure the widest possible coalition against russian aggression in georgia
7986649 russia should immediately withdraw all troops from georgia and implement the ceasefire agreement
7986650 as long as they the united states and european union recognize our georgias territorial integrity it will take time but we will restore our territorial integrity
7986651 this is all artificial and they abkhaz leaders know it
7986652 theyre opening the door to a big country with lots of minorities they will lose their culture their language

7986657 the marvel of marvels is not that god in his infinite love has not elected
7986658 to sin by silence when they should protest makes cowards out of men
7986659 the world is the devils hunting ground and children are his choicest game
7986660 the marvel of marvels is not that god in his infinite love has not elected

7986663 an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might there fore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had about it the same character of absolute covenanted faith fulness
7986664 and thus as providing the authoritative basis on which i as archbishop speak
7986665 no individuals speculations about this have any authority of themselves our anglican church has never exer cised close control over what individual theologians may say
7986666 dr williams has made a split inevitable in the anglican church
7986667 because marriage has other dimensions to do with children and society
7986668 in the context of a powerful and clearly thought out address as the fresh articulation of the mind of the church not as an opinion which he was bound to express but from which he privately wanted to dissent
7986669 he has our full and unqualified support in his magnificent leadership both of the church of england and of the anglican communion
7986670 an old thing and looked pique ish because the lambeth conference had achieved a greater harmony
7986671 rowan played a blinder at the conference showing masterful leader ship in a non pejorative and non belligerent way it was very subtle
7986672 in the past raised questions about this the fact remains that the church is not persuaded i am loyal to the church which has asked me to serve so the authority that i accept has to be the authority of the whole body
7986673 legitimising in the life of the conference and by implication in the communion the whole range of convictions about same sex relationships and about the use of scripture
7986674 strongly coloured by the well organised and well funded activities of groups and individuals lobbying against the communions teaching expressed in resolution 1 10 and for that publicly advocated by the episcopal church and those who think like it
7986675 everything had been managed to ensure that opposing and mutually incompatible views should be held in tension
7986676 best and most fruitful way forward for the anglican communion
7986677 recognition that a covenant clearly has to have some teeth
7986678 a huge achievement the anglican communion has not had over arching structures capable of bearing this strain
7986679 people came to realise that they wanted us at all costs to find ways of staying together in one communion recognising the huge loss if we do not
7986680 the liberal bishops who came to lambeth very doubtful about the concept of the covenant the more conservative bishops and provinces clear it was needed
7986681 one of the key changes in the anglican picture as a result of lambeth is the enhanced authority of archbishop rowan conservatives and liberals alike as well as all those of us who dont fit either label were inspired by his scholarly gentle and holy leadership
7986682 ours was beautifully led by a gentle spirited sudanese bishop anthony poggo
7986683 it was not possible for anyone to go to a meeting and slag off what someone had said while keeping their own powder dry
7986684 we are delivered in this country from cyclones poverty rampant hiv and tb compared with the things that are decimating people around the world we have more opportunity to give our attention to the things of god the gospel of christ than others have you feel slightly censured that were not more about our task because we have relatively so many fewer distractions than those in the developing world
7986685 season of gracious restraint for some time and i dont see there is any church wide push to end that in the coming months
7986686 the general convention is going to have to consider these issues general convention is the only body that really can decide to do anything significant related to them individual bishops have always made their own decisions within the canonical responsibilities of their dioceses
7986687 inappropriate and needing to cease that said im not terribly hopeful that they will stop
7986688 my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness

7986692 the executive white house has failed to satisfy its obligation to justify the courts exercise of such an extraordinary remedy
7986693 the executive should respond to the document aspect of the subpoenas by producing non privileged material and identifying more specifically the material it is withholding on a claim of executive privilege
7986694 there is still ample time for the parties to reach an accommodation
7986695 the court once again urges the political branches to resolve this dispute without the need for further recourse to the judicial branch
7986696 clearly rejects the white houses efforts to run out the clock

7986711 the course of history must not depend entirely on what the georgian president is saying
7986712 they just ran they abandoned their posts at the start of the bombing of gori
7986713 we showed the whole world what good peacekeepers the georgians are so in the end we just told them good bye
7986714 they said no we cant help georgians whoever pays us money we have to do what they want
7986715 why does everyone support them why are we the bad ones here
7986716 our children have been through this once and no one paid attention now the world does but why cant they understand we dont want to live with the georgians and thats it
7986717 weve both got photos and weve both got words to fight this war
7986718 barack obamas own history shows us what kind of president he would make hes repeatedly voted to raise taxes including higher taxes for anyone making 32 000 or more and voted against legislation protecting babies who have survived abortions he has said he would unconditionally meet with the likes of irans ahmadinejad threatening the safety of all americans barack obamas candidacy has made history but we cant afford the type of history he would make as president
7986719 it is past time for we the sovereign people to take responsibility for our governance we need to anchor our constitution with the founding principles as expressed in the 1776 declaration of independence
7986720 old dog who has a hard time learning new tricks
7986721 the majority of 1800 third year medical students surveyed reported doing something they believed was unethical
7986722 what i learned was how to survive as a medical student by forcing myself to believe that what i was doing was all right when deep
7986723 i live in a world in which i do not trust or believe in what i am doing and where i have grave doubts about what i am inflicting on other human beings
7986724 at present it is a rare person that emerges from medical training with his or her humanity intact

7986729 simple is defined from a technical standpoint not a usability standpoint it is better to be technically elegant with a higher learning curve than to be easy to use and technically inferior
7986730 and thats why we share all we have with you though theres little to be found when all youve got is nothing theres a lot to go around
7986731 but may i never boast except in the cross of our lord jesus christ through which the world has been crucified to me and i to the world

7986742 as we looked for compelling ways to make carls jr breakfast menu stand out from the crowd our consumer research revealed that many people felt that typical fast food breakfast items really didnt fill them up so much so that they often ordered two sandwiches at a time to get enough food
7986743 so weve satisfied that need in a big way with the new monster breakfast sandwich
7986744 first jack in the box tried to copy the groundbreaking carls jr six dollar burger line which we make with big charbroiled 100 black angus beef patties with their sirloin burgers which are fried on a flat grill
7986745 and now they are trying to blatantly rip off the carls jr western bacon cheeseburger which has been on our menu for more than 25 years

7986798 inevitably the vast majority of jewish israelis will view any talk about a one state solution as a threat even as an existential threat

7986819 most members did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative given that many households and businesses were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
7986820 although members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening
7986821 to help restrain inflation and inflation expectations which were at risk of drifting higher
7986822 saw a greater risk to the economy from upward pressures on inflation
7986823 generally expected to be weak during the remainder of 2008 before recovering modestly next year

7986825 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men
7986826 military operations lasted several hours during which airstrikes were called in the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some 7 8 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others local residents were able to confirm the number of casualties including names age and gender of the victims

7986833 although i am appalled by the increasing frequency with which our office is faced with child sexual abuse and exploitation cases i have every intention of seeing to it that we dedicate the prosecutorial resources necessary to combat it effectively every child in every picture is a victim that our office intends to fight for with every means at our disposal the eastern district of north carolina is hostile territory for anyone who considers the sexual abuse of a child an acceptable form of entertainment and i intend to do everything within my power to keep it that way
7986834 neither our office nor any law enforcement agency acting alone can deal with a problem of this magnitude
7986835 our success in project safe childhood has been built on the consistent cooperation and sharing of resources not only between federal agencies but between investigators at every level our community has every right to be concerned about this problem but it can also be proud and reassured that it has been blessed with such a well functioning team of investigators district wide who consistently put the protection of our children first
7986836 wayne county public schools students are closer to state and national averages than they have ever been
7986837 these results along with the no child left behind and abc results recently released show undeniable and impressive improvements made by the district relative to state and national standards
7986838 we can attribute much of our gains in student performance to the school reform efforts that have been implemented in recent years as we continue to build upon the programs that are in place and implement new programs in the schools it is our hope that our students will not only close the gap with the state and national averages but soon surpass them
7986839 i think london is going to be an amazing opportunity for kids to get involved with sport i dont know about the funding issues but you dont need huge amounts of funding ive been on hardly any at all a pool is a pool no matter what i just think its important for kids to get involved

7986844 what you just heard was the birth of a conspiracy between two different men with a single desire to win
7986845 i didnt get a lot of school when i was a child i guess they didnt have enough to go around

7986855 contrary to media reports britney was never slated to perform on this years
7986856 shes in the middle of recording her next album which is going amazingly well and her focus remains on the studio

7986858 paramount pictures studios in los angeles previously announced award show performers include britney spears amp lady gaga

7986864 after 20 minutes the pilot called nyala airport to tell him the plane had been hijacked and that he is en route to tripoli in libya
7986865 i am worried about my father and mother they are coming from nyala on this flight no one has any information about the situation they are in
7986866 this is the result of what the government is doing in the camps of displaced people in nyala
7986867 im not sure if its connected to kalma but its related to that the government kills and the international community does not intervene what can the darfurian people do
7986868 with three real examples we hope that we have shown that such trials are feasible and can lead to major improvements in speed and decision making
7986869 further study of the arid4 gene family may advance our understanding of the connection between gene regulation epigenetic control disease development and cancer formation
7986870 we also suggest that gene regulation by the arid4a and arid4b should be examined for potential disease related roles not only in human malignancies but also in other complex disease traits
7986871 our findings suggest that individuals presenting with features of inherited rcc susceptibility should be screened for germ line sdhb mutations because surveillance for sdhb related tumors can then be offered to mutation positive patients and relatives
7986872 it is entirely appropriate at this time to counsel patients carrying sdhb mutations espe cially those with arg mutations that they have a small but finite likelihood of developing rcc

7986875 i was scared of my first match thats the first time ive felt pressure since the world championship
7986876 it was always going to be a tough match playing michael but i didnt expect to win 5 1
7986877 although it was 5 1 there were three frames decided on the black ball so winning them was massive
7986878 ive not had the heart going like that for a while you never forget it but when it comes back its quite scary you realise youre under some pressure
7986879 id love to retain my title here this year ive got so many fond memories of winning here last year
7986880 i think dave filoni and his crew have really brought the fun back to star wars
7986881 theres more genuine character growth and interaction now more humor and from what ive been privy to so far it only gets better and better the theatrical release was just a teaser for whats to come and i have no doubt fans are going to fall in love with the tv series as well as the ongoing online clone wars web comic
7986882 when i drew my topps cards i had three favorites yoda grievous and asajj
7986883 i always have fun drawing those three but now that ive seen the movie which i loved ahsoka is my new favorite i love her character design i love her coolness and spunk and i think shes a blast to draw
7986884 topps really gave them a great sleek design and the imagery is beautiful the sketch cards are always fun and i think a lot of the artists really brought their a game to this set plus the actual animators and designers from the show contributed sketch cards to the set and theyre randomly mixed in with all the other sketch cards so not only can people pull a piece of original art but they also have a chance of pulling a piece of original art drawn by someone whos directly involved with the show which is a huge treat
7986885 why would you want to go through all of that pain

7986891 we did it together and won it as a team
7986892 every game was different and in every situation someone else stepped up and contributed to us winning its all about the giants
7986893 having the opportunity to look every player in the eye as they came up and the joy and excitement that they demonstrated as they came forward to receiver a memento of a world championship was special
7986894 its a feeling the players will carry in their hearts forever
7986895 pay no attention to the latest round of titillating rumors that john mccain is mulling colin powell as a possible running mate theyre totally bogus and mccain and his senior advisers know it
7986896 informed sources told the daily news that when mccain called on the retired general and national icon a few weeks ago the veepship was raised by the candidate and powell emphatically squelched the idea
7986897 colin was absolutely unambiguous said a source aware of the conversation
7986898 the world is going to alter the fundamental weakness comparatively speaking between their list and the all star list of back benchers

7986902 inventory of existing home sales has definitely been affected by foreclosure sales and the new home market has been afflicted by that negatively

7986922 once the team management and the swimmers and nzoc get back in the country well meet with them and review everything and decide at that stage whether any further action is necessary
7986923 im just really keen to make sure something silly like this doesnt overshadow the incredible performances that they had
7986924 whether its a cycling team or a swimming team its made pretty clear to them what the code of conduct is and clearly something like this probably breaches that
7986925 for something like this to put a dampener on it is a real shame
7986926 inappropriate and foolhardy behaviour at the end of a long campaign
7986927 its something that both swimming new zealand and the nzoc will have to address its not something that can be ignored

7986952 to suggest that cpms are trained to do abortions or that they would even want to is beyond the pale cpms are all about delivering babies abortion is not within their scope of practice abortions are performed by obstetricians not by midwives
7986953 but considering that the missouri physicians association told their own members last year that this legislation would allow bricklayers and crane operators to deliver babies im not surprised at this new attempt to distort the truth
7986954 the new law clearly references the federal medicaid statutes to define the scope of practice for which cpms are certified and as everyone knows the federal medicaid program does not cover abortion except under rare circumstances as defined by the hyde amendment more importantly cpms are not certified to provide abortions by their certifying body the north american registry of midwives and this statute is directly linked to cpms certified scope of practice the basic certification of cnms does not include abortion either

7987249 this study highlights the need for congress to revisit the way dietary supplements are regulated in the u s
7987250 our first priority must be the safety of the public herbs and supplements with high levels of lead mercury and arsenic should not be available for sale on the internet or elsewhere
7987251 we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing
7987252 the results of this study represent a potentially new therapeutic approach that of control of a biochemical cause of hypertension rather than nonspecifically lowering elevated bp although not representing a fully developed therapeutic strategy this study raises an alternative strategy that may prove to be more effective than currently available options
7987253 if you reduce uric acid at least in some patients you may be able to reduce blood pressure
7987254 this could be one way people develop hypertension and may allow us to develop new therapies
7987255 this is far from being a reasonable therapeutic intervention for high blood pressure but these findings indicate a first step in understanding the pathway of the disease
7987256 you cannot prevent a disease until you know the cause this study is way of finding that out
7987257 the antihypertensive therapies available to patients are well proven and safe
7987258 currently available antihyperuricemic therapies treatments that lower uric acid are not safe enough to be used as first line therapy for most people with high blood pressure
7987259 because few interventions in critically ill adult patients reduce mortality to this extent the results of this trial were enthusiastically received and rapidly incorporated into guidelines
7987260 these recommendations have led to worldwide adoption of tight glucose control in a variety of intensive care unit icu settings
7987261 given the overall findings of this meta analysis it seems appropriate that the guidelines recommending tight glucose control in all critically ill patients should be re evaluated until the results of larger more definitive clinical trials are available
7987262 possible explanations for the discordant results of the study by van den berghe et al and the meta analysis by wiener et al are that the meta analysis is flawed the studies that form the basis of the meta analysis are flawed or inherently different or the findings of the study by van den berghe et al occurred due to random chance or as a result of another unique factor interacting with tight glycemic control
7987263 those investigating tight glycemic control should take a step back and address the fundamental questions of defining quality standards for tight glycemic control finding affordable methods of frequent and highly accurate measurement of blood glucose in the icu and conduct multicenter efficacy studies to determine if tighter glycemic control can reduce mortality under optimal conditions if tighter glycemic control can be proven effective in optimal conditions determining how to make that benefit available to millions of critically ill patients in both developed and resource poor countries around the world would be a truly worthwhile challenge there is no simple or clear answer to the complex problem of glycemic control in critically ill adults at present targeting tight glycemic control cannot be said to be either right or wrong

7987267 i dont think its a happy day for catholics when a man who is literally dead wrong on what the catholic leadership of the united states has said for over three decades is the most important issue of social justice in our country is named to a national ticket and attempts to present himself as an intellectually serious and coherent catholic

7987419 das schachbrett auf dem der kampf um globale vorherrschaft auch in zukunft ausgetragen wird
7987420 dieses riesige merkw rdig geformte eurasische schachbrett das sich von lissabon bis wladiwostok erstreckt ist der schauplatz des global play
7987421 wobei eine dominanz auf dem gesamten eurasischen kontinent noch heute die voraussetzung f r globale vormachtstellung ist
7987422 eine macht die eurasien beherrscht w rde ber zwei der drei h chst entwickelten und wirtschaftlich produktivsten regionen der welt gebieten
7987423 amerikas potentielle herausforderer auf politischem und oder wirtschaftlichem gebiet ausnahmslos eurasische staaten
7987424 dass kein staat oder keine gruppe von staaten die f higkeit erlangt die vereinigten staaten aus eurasien zu vertreiben oder auch nur deren schiedsrichterrolle entscheidend zu beeintr chtigen
7987425 die gefahr eines pl tzlichen aufstiegs einer neuen macht erfolgreich hinauszuschieben
7987426 die beherrschende stellung amerikas f r noch mindestens eine generation und vorzugsweise l nger zu bewahren
7987427 amerikas zentrales geostrategisches ziel in europa l sst sich also ganz einfach zusammenfassen durch eine glaubw rdigere transatlantische partnerschaft muss der br ckenkopf der usa auf dem eurasischen kontinent so gefestigt werden dass ein wachsendes europa ein brauchbares sprungbrett werden kann von dem aus sich eine internationale ordnung der demokratie und zusammenarbeit nach eurasien hinein ausbreiten l sst
7987428 amerika als die f hrende weltmacht hat nur eine kurze historische chance der relative frieden der derzeit auf der welt herrscht k nnte kurzlebig sein
7987429 in wie freundlichen farben auch immer man eine solche unipolare welt ausmalen mag letztlich beziehe sich der terminus auf eine bestimmte situation in der es ein zentrum der staatsgewalt ein machtzentrum und ein entscheidungszentrum gibt das ist eine welt in der es einen herrn gibt einen souver n
7987430 was gegenw rtig in der welt geschieht ist eine folge der versuche genau dieses konzept das konzept einer unipolaren welt in die internationalen beziehungen zu tragen gegenw rtig erleben wir eine fast unbeschr nkte berm ige anwendung von gewalt milit rischer gewalt in den internationalen beziehungen einer gewalt die die welt in einen abgrund permanenter konflikte st rzt im ergebnis haben wir nicht gen gend kraft auch nur einen dieser konflikte wirklich umfassend zu l sen politische l sungen zu finden wird gleichfalls unm glich ein staat und dabei spreche ich nat rlich zun chst und vor allem von den vereinigten staaten hat seine nationalen grenzen in jeder hinsicht berschritten
7987431 schlie lich k nnte ein solches europa sogar ein eckpfeiler einer unter amerikanischer schirmherrschaft stehenden gr eren eurasischen sicherheits und kooperationsstruktur werden
7987432 k me das tess transeurasisches sicherheitssystem also eines tages zu stande w re amerika nach und nach einiger seiner lasten ledig auch wenn es weiterhin als stabilisierende kraft und als schiedsrichter in eurasischen belangen eine ma gebliche rolle spielen w rde
7987433 von multinationalen korporationen organisationen gekn pftes netz schafft bereits ein informelles weltsystem im laufe der n chsten jahrzehnte k nnte somit eine funktionierende struktur weltweiter zusammenarbeit die auf dem geopolitischen gegebenheiten gr ndet entstehen und allm hlich die insignien des derzeitigen herrschers der welt annehmen n mlich der u s a anm h r ein geostrategischer erfolg dieser zielsetzung w re dann die durchaus angemessene erbschaft die amerika als erste einzige und letzte echte supermacht der nachwelt hinterlassen w rde
7987434 im ergebnis ist eine unipolare welt verheerend nicht nur f r alle die diesem system angeh ren sondern auch f r den souver n selbst weil es ihn von innen heraus selbst zerst rt und mit demokratie hat dies ganz gewiss nichts gemein denn demokratie ist wie sie wissen die herrschaft der mehrheit unter ber cksichtigung der interessen und meinungen der minderheit
7987435 ich bin der auffassung dass das unipolare modell nicht nur inakzeptabel sondern in der heutigen welt auch unm glich ist und zwar nicht nur deshalb weil f r die f hrung einer einzelnen macht in der heutigen ausgerechnet in der heutigen welt weder die milit rischen noch die politischen und konomischen ressourcen ausreichen w rden noch wichtiger ist dass das modell selbst verfehlt ist weil ihm keine moralischen fundamente f r die moderne zivilisation zu grunde liegen
7987436 unilateral und h ufig illegitime aktionen haben kein einziges problem gel st vielmehr haben sie neue menschliche trag dien verursacht und neue spannungsherde geschaffen urteilen sie selbst die zahl der kriege wie auch der lokalen und regionalen konflikte hat sich nicht vermindert herr teltschik hat dies sehr behutsam angesprochen und in diesen konflikten gehen nicht weniger menschen zugrunde es sterben sogar noch mehr als zuvor betr chtlich mehr entschieden mehr
7987437 ich m chte nicht dass sie der illusion erliegen dass wir irgendjemanden nicht mehr lieben
7987438 wir sagten dass wir nicht die ressourcen und nicht den wunsch haben ein solches system raketenabwehrsystem aufzustellen aber als profis verstehen wir dass eine illusion von sicherheit entsteht wenn die eine seite ein solches system hat und die andere nicht und dass dies die m glichkeit eines nuklearen konfliktes erh ht
7987439 und wenn dieses gleichgewicht in der welt schlie lich zerst rt wird dann wird es eine katastrophe nicht nur f r russland sondern auch f r die gesamte welt sein

7987457 never underestimate the ability of a bureaucracy just to screw things up through inefficiency im sure that there is some sectarianism in these decisions but i also am confident that some of it is just inefficient bureaucracy
7987458 there are five or six different iraqi entities that get a cut on who gets in and who doesnt
7987459 even that subset of the population that meets the physical and literacy requirements
7987460 typically things like this happen we give the ministry of interior 1 000 names they look at the names they say well let 400 people into the iraqi police if you look at the 400 people they let into the iraqi police a bunch of them werent on our list and theyre also overwhelming ly shiite
7987461 oh sure well let that colonel in the republican guard into the iraqi police but well make him an enlisted beat cop
7987462 do you know how low on the social scale that is in iraq and how humiliating this is
7987463 weve lived through years of humiliating these guys and seen the results thats produced
7987464 you dont have to believe that 100 000 of these guys are going to turn back into insurgents if 5 000 of them do that could be a big problem

7987481 species invasions and extinction the future of native biodiversity on islands
7987482 the presumption at the time was that we are driving biodiversity to lower levels
7987483 certainly if you think about it at the global level this is true because humans have done a lot of things that have driven species extinct
7987484 what dov and i worked on a few years ago is the fact that the vast majority of introductions of species dont have large negative effects
7987485 indeed most species that get introduced dont have much effect at all it doesnt mean that theyre not altering the ecosystem but theyre not driving things extinct like some of the big poster child stories weve been hearing about
7987486 the dramatic increase in the number of species has changed how the system functions
7987487 changing the abundance of natives versus exotics affects all of the other species that used to depend on the natives for food or shelter so its not in any way to say that increasing biodiversity is a good thing
7987488 that by going in and mucking up the system we may have already created the setting where too many species have been packed in and we just havent waited long enough to see these extinctions start to happen
7987489 the whole point of this study was to start looking down the path to see which of these wildly different scenarios might be right
7987490 we havent nailed the answer yet but weve set the stage for answering whether islands are now saturated or not
7987491 it was very surprising to find such a strong correlation between the number of native and exotic plant species on islands around the world
7987492 in ecological research a strong correlation often explains 50 percent of the variation here the correlation between native and exotics explains almost 100 percent of the variation in other words if you know how many native plants are on an oceanic island then you can predict almost perfectly how many exotic plants are there
7987493 which means islands that are far enough away from a continent that theyre not getting regular exchanges with the mainland
7987494 although we have a significant armament of therapeutic agents against hiv factors that dictate the pharmacokinetics of anti hiv drugs need to be accounted for in order to have haart efficacy in sequestered viral reservoirs several p gp inhibitors are currently under clinical trial however very little is being done to target the mrp transporters our studies using the anti hiv drugs saquinavir and zidovudine clearly implicated that inhibition of mrps rather than p gp would be a more beneficial approach to facilitate the entry of haart drugs into the sub endothelial reservoirs of hiv especially within the brain unpublished findings from our laboratory suggest that similar to mk 571 other leukotriene receptor antagonists e g montelukast singulairtm and zafirlukast accolatetm can suppress mrp mediated efflux of these anti hiv drugs as well we believe that adjunct therapy with these clinically approved mrp inhibitors may improve haart efficacy in hiv positive patients deter the selection of drug resistance and delay the progression of aids
7987495 the concept of independent scientific review has been in practice since the 18th century and is crucial to ensuring that ideas and proposed work are scientifically sound
7987496 this overhaul of the endangered species act would place the fate of rare species in the hands of government stakeholders who are not qualified to assess the environmental impacts of their activities
7987497 what if we allowed pharmaceutical companies to approve and distribute drugs without consulting the food and drug administration
7987498 the result would spell potential disaster for humans in this case the vulnerable party is our environment

7987523 hard to avoid the conclusion that sales have bottomed out
7987524 inventories are very high relative to sales rates and would probably be even more so if all those wishing to sell their home actually had the house on the market instead of pulling it off in the face of weak demand and eroding prices
7987525 there is still a considerable distance to travel before prices sink to levels necessary to balance supply and demand in the housing market
7987526 abbiamo le prove del fatto che i bombardamenti della scorsa settimana hanno causato la morte di sessanta bambini quindici donne e altrettanti uomini e il ferimento di ulteriori quindici afghani

7987638 wow where to begin at first sight of sound sanctuarys artwork one wouldnt know exactly where to place the band indie posers disparate wannabes or maybe just maybe theyre something totally unique and harbour the kind of musical gems us mere mortals can only dream of happily its the latter on this flawlessly beautiful outing from this generations radiohead from the sweet melodies of dust to the mournful carried away via the trip hop manglings of blonde pray sound sanctuary have given us a stunning platter of indie esque art rock that lays claim to no one genre instead it adapts every genre from blues to electronica from soul to rock to create something truly unique

7987778 these two deaths were entirely preventable and arose from the clear failure of scottish coal to provide suitable means of communication between different vehicles on site in order to reduce the risk of collisions as well as a failure to manage vehicles on their site
7987779 earth moving vehicles such as dump trucks or bulldozers have poor visual fields due to their large size
7987780 it is crucial that additional steps are taken to ensure that the drivers of these dump trucks are aware of other smaller vehicles around them
7987781 control measures to reduce the risk are easily available at a minimal cost installing an additional camera on the side of the dump truck fitting a raised roof beacon or other means of improving visibility on the land rover could prevent similar incidents in the future

7987789 plunged deeper into his environmental interests joining forces with an environmental advocacy group to promote the health of the oceans
7987790 the best thing about this year is we have had two dynamic candidates
7987791 if either one won it would still be a great story what im sensing is a real interest among democrats to put the primary behind us
7987792 what i took from the speech by michelle obama was that she is a public servant herself
7987793 thats the message that prevailed yesterday this is a strong and dynamic woman who could have gone into her own private practice but she is about helping all americans across the board
7987794 we have to come out of here recognizing that conscious of that community message michelle obama delivered because the gop will use any tactic to prevent history from happening in november
7987795 we must be very proud we have candidates who exemplify what america is truly about the republicans as they have demonstrated over the course of these recent years have a private agenda the federal government in republican hands is not focused on community concerns
7987796 i have no plans to make any changes right now im lucky to be working for senator menendez
7987797 though they come from two different places and slightly different times their backgrounds are very similar lower middle class families
7987798 they embraced the american dream they seized all the opportunities that were given to them and they are classic american stories
7987799 delaware knows it well people in the early four states got a glimpse of it but we never had a platform or a megaphone for the rest of the country to see it
7987800 we decided to build a new airport and didnt have the money to do it we found a great advocate for us in senator frank lautenberg
7987801 as a matter of fact a wing of that airport should be named after frank lautenberg
7987802 the reason jon corzine is able to be governor is that he was managing the bonds on the denver airport at goldman sachs so theres a connection from your governor too
7987803 we might get lucky and get some get another cutting maybe late september or early october it just depends on the rain
7987804 it allows the ground to absorb it and soak it in versus the hard rain that runs off
7987805 the fruiting is over with they usually fruit june july august
7987806 but the rain will keep the bushes themselves healthy and put them in good shape to bear fruit again next year
7987807 everything is suffering from the droughts so anything we can get is going to help build up soil moisture and help the crops
7987808 i would like to see it rain for 30 days straight
7987809 how can you make sure you fill it with the most fun and that you visit all the coolest places on earth before you pack those bags for the very last time
7987810 he didnt have enough days but he lived them like he should have
7987811 100 things cowboys fans should know and do before they die
7987812 my personal view is that that is not good policy at this time but he obama thinks less disparity in income between those who are wealthy and those who are less wealthy
7987813 is saying taxes are the wrong way to stimulate the economy at this time all things being equal well probably have a democratic congress so mccain can say he wants to produce lots of different tax cuts but itll be hard to get that through so he can take a chance
7987814 obamas an economic conservative by nature at chicago he hung out with lots of economics professors and theyre not flaming revolutionaries i was pleased to hear him say that hes interested in restoring work to different segments of the economy so id look to obama to take some new steps toward creating more inclusiveness in the u s economy weve just gone through 8 years of a spending rampage we already have a big deficit well have an even bigger one by the time either candidate is elected i cant imagine therell be an increase in government spending in that situation
7987815 the u s constitution gives congress political responsibility to regulate government spending not the president it looks like a democratic year in the house and the senate
7987816 i dont think well be going back to the days of lyndon johnson whoever gets elected youre not going to have a big swing in economic policy
7987817 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for

7987828 pero creo que si se mira bien esta semana estoy absolutamente convencido de que ambos hillary clinton y bill clinton entienden lo que est en juego
7987829 su deficiencia n mero uno a la vista de los votantes que no se decidieron a n es que carece de la experiencia y juicio para asumir el rol de comandante en jefe as que no vi nada anoche que me lleve a creer que ha comenzado a unir esa brecha

7987838 todo ese tipo de agresiones son in tiles e innecesarias me parece que lo que importa es hacer una reforma beuna para el pa s valdivieso y yo coincidimos que lo mejor que se puede hacer con el presidente es decirle la verdad cuando se piense que las cosas no se han manejado de la mejor manera

7987842 we do have a very aggressive goal to raise over 200 000 by the time the event closes which means we would need to raise a minimum of 50 000 within the telethons hours from the donations of second life residents
7987843 with slcns technology this will be the first live telethon produced within second life something that is only possible with the slcn viewership we hope to bring a substantial worldwide audience to the telethon and feel privileged to play an integral part in this groundbreaking event
7987844 spinner used to shit on the flat thing you can see on the floor
7987845 you don bradman i kill you man i bowl at you i kill you split you in two
7987846 mate you couldnt even get merv hughes out youd have no chance against me
7987847 he was quick to pick up the ball had fantastic footwork that got him in a position and wasnt afraid to hit across the ball
7987848 remember then our bats only weighed 2lb 2oz if he used the ones they have these days he wouldnt have averaged 99 94 hed have averaged 199 94
7987849 the main thing was to try to stop him scoring the only way you could do that was bowl a good length and pretty straight because he never let many balls go
7987850 he would always attack you had to bowl straight and make sure the ball did something i guessed it would be a long day if the ball didnt do anything and don was around
7987851 everyone wanted to shake his hand and get to know him because of that and because people took advantage of him he was a bit careful when it came to making friends with people
7987852 he never offered any advice but early in the tour i was struggling so i asked my room mate sammy loxton to ask the boss what i was doing wrong sammy had a chat with the boss and he came back and told me that don said tell your mate that if he keeps the ball on the ground then he cant get out i did and my form improved
7987853 i suppose you could say i denied him the 100 average
7987854 the pitch took a bit of spin because eric never spun it much on a good pitch
7987855 but that day he bowled a googly don half touched it and it went on to the wicket there was silence i dont think people could believe what happened
7987856 he took his pads off and said fancy doing a thing like that that was all he said he was that kind of bloke
7987857 he had signed the bat with which i got my headingley hundred he wrote this bat is a symbol of a great innings by my friend neil harvey during australias greatest test victory

7987866 alla luce dellepisodio di ieri chiara la necessit di mettere in campo leggi pi efficaci per arginare i fenomeni criminosi bisogna sollecitare lintervento degli appartenenti alle forze dellordine anche fuori dal servizio con campagne di sensibilizzazione e magari con interventi legislativi meno garantisti che non imbriglino polizia e magistratura tra le maglie di leggi che nella realt dei fatti si rivelano inefficaci
7987867 sarebbe opportuno affiancare alle forze di polizia nazionale operatori di polizia municipale nel controllo del territorio come ho detto pi volte anche solo per statistica impensabile che nel luogo di un reato non si trovino mai a passare un poliziotto un carabiniere un finanziere un agente di polizia penitenziaria o un agente del corpo delle guardie forestali anche fuori servizio

7987888 the decision to enter into this agreement is consistent with our long held view that the repurchase of our shares is a very attractive use of excess capital furthermore using internal capital to purchase our shares reflects our confidence in aflacs overall financial position despite the turmoil of todays capital markets the overall credit profile of our investment portfolio is very favorable and our capital adequacy ratios in the united states and japan remain strong in addition to our confidence in aflacs balance sheet strength we continue to believe we are well positioned to achieve our objectives for earnings per share growth we expect to achieve our goal for 2008 of a 14 to 15 increase in operating earnings per share excluding the impact of foreign currency our objective for 2009 is to increase operating earnings per share 13 to 15 excluding the impact of foreign currency with the timing of the repurchase under this agreement occurring in late 2008 and early next year we are even more confident we will achieve next years earnings objective

7987893 it seems like non melanoma skin cancer even though it is a non fatal disease may be a warning sign for increased risk of other more serious cancers
7987894 it is far and away the most common form of cancer
7987895 a v shaped association between ldl cholesterol and cancer risk suggests that multiple mechanisms are involved
7987896 ldl cholesterol is unlikely the sole or direct causal factor
7987897 the biggest buyout firms are used to gaming the system to turn a profit its no surprise they want special rules now to take over another sector of our economy
7987898 it is a bit of an anomaly to say you want to be paid to stay amateur i dont believe james degale will stay as an amateur for the next four years until 2012
7987899 but you never know an olympic gold medal is something special and so is a games in london
7987900 degale now has a great calling card and it is a lot like amir khan who won the silver medal in athens there is not a lot of difference it is a great way to become a professional fighter having that gold status around your neck
7987901 boxing is my business and i will be talking to him but my advice to him right now is to take his time he doesnt have to decide immediately bask in the glory give it a month or two and then have a look at his options

7987916 im in as good a shape as i can be with my knee
7987917 ive got a little ways to go im not going to fool anybody but my doctor did as good a job as possible to get me ready
7987918 i think they have a pretty similar team and i thought i could come in there and fill that second line role bring some versatility on the power play im just doing whatever i can to help the team
7987919 its a tough act to follow but i think people will find this city very very attractive
7987920 its nice to have 10 and 12 play drives but theyre difficult and theyre hard over an extended period of time
7987921 our ability to get yards in chunks is going to be big for us
7987922 everyone knows we werent into it like we should have been last year
7987923 now everybody knows what theyre doing everybodys focused in i think its going to make a big difference
7987924 we just made little mistakes and little things here and there with all those young guys and no really experienced older guys to kind of settle the issues down we just had to kind of struggle through it a little bit weve got a lot of choices now
7987925 its our job as coaches to put these guys in position to do well
7987926 hopefully all they want to do is win at the end of the day if you win a lot of football games people are going to be happy
7987927 the first group has just been really hard to throw the ball on

7987930 most members did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative given that many households and businesses were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
7987931 although members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening
7987932 to help restrain inflation and inflation expectations which were at risk of drifting higher
7987933 saw a greater risk to the economy from upward pressures on inflation
7987934 we dont have an active investigation generated by this office
7987935 this goes back to the question of how is it fair that people enjoy being part of a great city with a thriving urban center which they visit and not feel they have to pay for it
7987936 taken individually the irregularities in this case generally appear minor
7987937 when reviewed in their entirety however we believe that the handling of this case raises some significant concerns
7987938 boyd corporate had knowledge and failed to act that is the exact definition
7987939 while the investigation file in this case contained considerable evidence to support a willful classification there is also evidence to the contrary
7987940 since substantially similar violations were cited previously at another boyd gaming property in nevada federal osha likely would have classified them as repeat if not willful violations
7987941 i dont recall that weve ever said something along those lines to say they wouldnt have done it that way clearly implies fed osha is concerned about what happened and wants to make sure procedures would preclude it from happening again
7987942 maybe they were afraid to fight it but you know what they could have tried
7987943 senior professional staff who are familiar with the investigation and conversant with technical compliance issues are available to participate in the resolution of significant and complex cases whenever possible
7987944 in this case for example nevada could have made czehowski available for a brief period in order to assist in the resolution of this high profile double fatality accident case
7987945 nevada should carefully consider the appropriateness of the use of consultation as a tool in future settlement agreements
7987946 i really love wales so its great to have the chance to play at a big festival here instead of taking the motorway we took the road up through the brecon beacons i feel at home here
7987947 bryn has asked me to be involved for a few years but because of filming ive never been able to
7987948 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show
7987949 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7987950 we have provided daleks and components for the tardis in the past and i think a one off move to the screen would be amazing
7987951 it would take dr who to the next level so should be very successful
7987952 i think david tenant is an excellent doctor who is perfect for the part because he is eccentric and a nice guy too
7987953 this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made
7987954 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride
7987955 we hope to make torchwood a gripping and surprising tv event with storylines that push our team into greater danger and sacrifice
7987956 for everyone who poured their time energy and creativity into the making of this project i give my sincerest congratulations
7987957 maybe if the live action star wars tv series goes ahead i might try and wheedle my way back into the affections of lucasfilm and write an episode
7987958 the weird thing and i think this goes for both star trek and doctor who is that neither of them are remakes i often see star trek being referred to as a remake and it really isnt its another star trek film its another movie in the series its the continuing mission
7987959 doctor who is like that as well and because of the nature of how doctor who evolves you become part of that tradition rather than a re handling of it
7987960 both of those are perfect examples of taking the spirit of the original material and entirely maintaining it
7987961 teniendo en cuenta la libre expresi n de la voluntad de los pueblos oseta y abjaso he firmado los decretos sobre el reconocimiento por la federaci n de rusia de la independencia de osetia del sur y de la independencia de abjasia

7987963 las autoridades georgianas han desatado un conflicto armado cuyas v ctimas fueron civiles

7987966 the new season sees the torchwood team embarking on a single action paced adventure as they battle for the future of the human race against the fiercest force they have encountered
7987967 this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store
7987968 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
7987969 russia is a state which has to ensure its interests along the whole length of its border this is absolutely clear
7987970 there is no blockade any ship can get in american and others are bringing in humanitarian cargoes and what the americans call humanitarian cargoes of course they are bringing in weapons
7987971 russias actions in recent weeks call into question russias commitment to peace and stability in the caucasus
7987972 i dont think we should be afraid of isolation i dont believe isolation is looming
7987973 russias actions are an attempt to militarily annex a sovereign nation in direct violation of international law
7987974 the russian federation is seeking to validate the use of violence direct military aggression and ethnic cleansing to forcibly change the borders of a neighbouring state
7987975 this is not an easy choice to make but it represents the only possibility to save human lives
7987976 saakashvili opted for genocide to accomplish his political objectives by doing so he himself dashed all the hopes for the peaceful coexistence of ossetians abkhazians and georgians in a single state
7987977 absolutely inevitable short of losing our dignity as a nation
7987978 it calls for a political solution to the conflicts in georgia it will examine the consequences of russias decision from this point of view

7987980 gday damien thank you so much for this i cannot tell you how stoked i am to win my philosophy around this pattern i picked the pattern as it was out of my confort zone the wonky nine patches that is i have never made a quilt with anything that wasnt perfectly square and i loved this pattern i picked the fabric range as i just love black bird designs fabrics and i love love love their patterns but i am also aware that ill never applique one of them as i dont have enough time so next best thing to a black bird design pattern is their fabric i also love moda fabric the quality is always there i also like to have quilts out for christmas but be able to use them year round cant see the point in slaving over a hot sewing machine to only have the finish product on show for a week i love fiddling on your site damien its a ripper idea and its fun and much cheaper than surfing the net or ebay when i am bored so you have saved me some s
7987981 thanks damien how exciting to win a quilt i have been having enormous fun playing with all the lovely fabrics online its true i am a heather bailey fan ever since reading about the birth of freshcut via her blog when it comes to fabrics anything in shades of mint aqua duck egg blue or jade green always seems to catch my eye first i also love big florals especially roses it wasnt until i took another look at starflower that i realised how much it reminded me of one of my favourite places a beautiful national trust historic house where i used to work the main bedroom was restored to all its 1930s glory with soft duck egg blue walls cream lacquered furniture and beautiful soft furnishings including a quilted comforter all made from a big rose covered sanderson print fabric i was a bit worried that the pistachio pink colourway of the sashing fabric might have looked better against the paisley print but thinking of that lovely old bedroom the deep coral and buttery yellow are more in keeping with 1930s style i already have a half yard of the big floral freshcut fabric used on the top and bottom borders enough now to make 2 matching cushion covers the quilt will look lovely on my fianc s treasured dark green leather sofa but it might be a while before i can send you a picture of the finished quilt top this will be my first quilt so i want to take my time to get it just right
7987982 hi damian i was so glad to receive the quilt kit in the mail the tokyo rose pattern came together well thanks to the numbered diagram that came with the pattern i was able to put it together rather quickly here is a picture of the pieced top it is not yet quilted but i am very pleased with both the pattern and the batik colors thanks again glenda
7987983 thank you right now my design philosophy is all about color my husband and i have been renovating a house we bought last year and everything is beige or off white so i am always looking for ways to add color and interesting patterns without overloading the small space adding a wall hanging quilt is the just the way to make the place look less like a construction site and more like home

7988060 im excited about the addition of these student athletes to the western illinois tennis family because i think they are each outstanding young adults first and exciting student athletes that will excel in both the classroom and on the tennis court
7988061 we are adding three more illinois student athletes to our program and that is something that both dr van alstine and i feel is very important
7988062 jim is obviously a very good athlete that we expect to come in and compete for a spot in singles lineup and add depth to our team
7988063 i think he has the potential to develop into a team leader and is the type of student athlete we want representing western illinois he is the son of a successful high school tennis coach father tony was a 1998 inductee into the illinois high school tennis coaches association hall of fame and i think will bring the discipline and analytical ability that you would expect of a coachs son
7988064 mandela is a bit of a late bloomer who i feel has a great deal of upside
7988065 we have never neglected our core gamers we still have developers working on popular core gaming franchises but we need longer to complete these games approximately two to three years these games are not ready to launch in early 2009 but are being worked on by all development teams
7988066 i dont interpret this as a return to the gunboat diplomacy of the early 20th century the activation of the fourth fleet doesnt mean that they are going to start attacking any countries but i think its a signal that the united states wants to make and it should be interpreted that way not more than that because there has been a great deal of noise on whats happening down south about the chinese with the iranians now in several countries including cuba and also noise about russia
7988067 and i think all of that has to do with this particular measure
7988068 the united states is growing increasingly apprehensive that china and russia are selling arms to latin american countries including venezuela
7988069 the united states is beginning to worry about the rest of the world poaching on this region that traditionally has been favored as particularly close to the united states so we have the resource diplomacy added to the military diplomacy on the part of china and spain and brazil and russia all selling arms venezuela is buying 2 billion worth of weapons from russia and china is a major seller of military equipment and a major buyer of energy of oil
7988070 so latin america is getting rich from all of these sales just at the time that its becoming more and more politically defiant against the united states and determined to go its own way
7988071 unasur is a gathering of exclusively latin american countries this is an oas without the united states as a member and being added to it is a security apparatus again under brazilian auspices which represents an extraordinary challenge to the united states and its very clear that brazil is beginning to make its stand as a regional superpower and is no longer deferring to the united states
7988072 so this is a very vital area theyre signing agreements among themselves they are making trips to otherwise rogue nations this isnt your old grandfathers latin america
7988073 one group of countries in which i would place both governments of the center right and the center left would like to engage the united states constructively to focus on economic ties and maintaining cordial political contacts
7988074 the other group in which i would place the populist governments like those of venezuela bolivia ecuador or nicaragua would like to create barriers between latin america and the united states and form a sort of
7988075 you have agencies that are a lot more interested in the war on drugs so they would like to put the emphasis on military ties with latin america and on making colombia a pivotal case for the rest of the continent
7988076 but then you have people at the state department who are much more interested in engaging the region politically and they have been even willing to talk to the bolivian government despite the very hostile attitude that the bolivian government had vis vis the united states at least in the first few years of the evo morales government
7988077 the u s has certainly stopped pressing on latin american countries to take an adversarial relationship with venezuela i think there is a great deal of recognition in this administration about latin america wanting to have a more independent foreign policy to have more diverse international relations
7988078 and the next president simply should move forward with the recognition that latin america has matured its doing pretty well on economic political and social grounds and theres every reason to be optimistic about the future
7988079 i think thats a major sign of success in a relationship even when youre absolutely furious with your partner you grit your teeth count to ten or 37 and deal with it you dont leave you dont give up you dont get abusive you deal with it

7988084 until carter ruck and partners and englands stifling libel laws got to work the few american journalists not caught up in obama mania were turning to the archives of the british press to answer an intriguing question who is
7988085 a libel claimant does not have to prove that the words are false or to prove that he has in fact suffered any loss damage is presumed
7988086 as far as he can remember he has had no direct contact with mr obama
7988087 mr rezkos lawyer said his client had longstanding indebtedness to mr auchis general mediterranean holding gmh by june 2007 he owed it 27 9 million under a loan forgiveness agreement described in court m auchi lent mr rezko 3 5 million in april 2005 and 11 million in september 2005 as well as 3 5 million transferred in april 2007 that agreement provided for the outstanding loans to be forgiven in return for a stake in the 62 acre riverside park development
7988088 mr auchi first met mr rezko after the 2003 iraq war and they have a business relationship
7988089 mr auchi was convicted of corruption given a suspended sentence and fined 1 4 million in france in 2003 for his part in the elf affair described as the biggest political and corporate scandal in post war europe he in a statement from his media lawyers claims he is appealing against the sentence
7988090 a 2004 pentagon report obtained by the washington times identified auchi as a global arms dealer and iraqi billionaire who behind the facade of legitimate business served as saddam husseins principle sic international financial manipulator and bag man
7988091 the report to the pentagon inspector general stated that significant and credible evidence has been developed that nadhmi auchi has engaged in unlawful activities working closely with iraqi intelligence operatives to bribe foreign governments and individuals prior to operation iraqi freedom to turn opinion against the american led mission to remove saddam hussein

7988094 the libel lawyer peter carter ruck who died on friday had a chilling effect on the media he was a chancer out for the maximum fee and he did for freedom of speech what the boston strangler did for door to door salesmen he established the idea that libel law was complicated and merited very high fees in the process he became very rich i like to bill the clients as the tears are flowing he told me
7988095 the name nadhmi auchi was just another name for saddams intelligence service or so we thought said nibras kazimi a former iraqi dissident who is now a visiting scholar at the hudson institute in washington d c
7988096 mr auchi is a business partner of syrian born businessman antoin tony rezko who has supported mr obama financially since his first run for the illinois state senate in 1996
7988097 in 1996 according to european news accounts belgiums ambassador to luxembourg charged that banque continentale du luxembourg a bank that nadhmi auchi and paribas jointly controlled until 1994 had handled personal accounts for former dictator of iraq saddam hussein
7988098 auchi has been able to collect british politicians the way other people collect stamps
7988099 on the 20th anniversary of his business in 1999 mr auchi received a greeting card signed by 130 politicians including tony blair william hague and charles kennedy who were then leaders of their respective parties
7988100 obama bagman is sent to jail over 3 5m payment by british tycoon
7988101 the united kingdom has become a popular venue for defamation plaintiffs from around the world because under english law it is not necessary for a libel plaintiff to prove falsity or actual malice as is required in the united states
7988102 ala is concerned that foreign libel lawsuits threaten u s authors and publishers and our freedoms of speech and the press through its chilling effect such venue shopping also denies the american people the right to read and to access information another inherent first amendment right essential to our democratic form of government
7988103 a presidential candidate must be prepared to face extraordinary levels of scrutiny if obama and his supporters think they can silence questions about his background his leftist terror bomber backers his god damn america pastor his cocaine use his financial dealings with indicted syrian born businessman tony rezko or with saddam hussein crony and oil for food banker nadhmi auchi they are mistaken
7988104 out of step with allies u s defends freedom to offend in speech
7988105 the magazine should be forbidden from saying similar things forced to publish a rebuttal and made to compensate muslims for injuring their dignity feelings and self respect

7988401 the brigadier himself and all his men were cut to pieces in this action
7988402 you may not like it but it seems to me we have got to face reality here congress is turning against this the navy doesnt want it
7988403 an economy of force operation in afghanistan we do what we can in iraq we do what we must
7988404 is improving the last key aspect of its ability to attack the u s the identification training and positioning of operatives for an attack in the homeland
7988405 progress achieved after six years of international engagement is under serious threat from resurgent violence weakening international resolve mounting regional challenges and a growing lack of confidence on the part of the afghan people about the future direction of their country
7988406 the very same conditions that enabled the taliban to come to power in the mid 1990s are rapidly emerging again unless we take a serious look at our policy i greatly fear we may be setting the stage for a tragic replay of recent afghan history
7988407 with our attention focused on iraq we run the risk of overlooking the alarming deterioration of security in afghanistan in both countries the projection of american military power was decisive but we have fallen short in demonstrating the staying power necessary to achieve stability
7988408 immediately assess its policy toward pakistan as well as its overall policy to counter terrorist groups such as al qaeda
7988409 to refocus the u s counter terrorism strategy and our national security resources on afghanistan and pakistan and implement a comprehensive new strategy to keep america safe
7988410 the global strategy of the united states to combat and defeat al qaeda and its affiliates
7988411 has protected or regenerated key elements of its homeland attack capability including a safehaven in the pakistan federally administered tribal areas fata
7988412 al qaeda will remain the most serious terrorist threat to the homeland as its central leadership continues to plan high impact plots
7988413 clear and present danger to afghanistan to pakistan and to the west in general and to the united states in particular
7988414 the united states faces a threat from al qaeda today that is comparable to what it faced on september 11 2001 the base of operations has moved only a short distance roughly the difference from new york to philadelphia
7988415 just as it had on the day before 9 11 al qaeda now has a band of terrorist camps from which to plan and train for attacks against western targets including the united states officials say the new camps are smaller than the ones the group used prior to 2001 however despite dozens of american missile strikes in pakistan since 2002 one retired c i a officer estimated that the makeshift training compounds now have as many as 2 000 local and foreign militants up from several hundred three years ago
7988416 top central intelligence agency official traveled secretly to islamabad this month to confront pakistans most senior officials with new information about ties between the countrys powerful spy service and militants operating in pakistans tribal areas according to american military and intelligence officials the c i a emissary presented evidence showing that members of the spy service had deepened their ties with some militant groups that were responsible for a surge of violence in afghanistan possibly including the suicide bombing this month of the indian embassy in kabul the officials said the c i a assessment specifically points to links between members of the spy service the directorate for inter services intelligence or isi and the militant network led by maulavi jalaluddin haqqani which american officials believe maintains close ties to senior figures of al qaeda in pakistans tribal areas
7988417 al qaeda at this point is a fairly dynamic movement and it has the way i would describe it is in some ways like a cancer its metastasized and its spread to other places like al qaeda in north africa the maghreb and al qaeda in the levant and so on and these groups as best we can tell have a fair amount of independence they get inspiration they get sometimes guidance probably some training probably some money from the al qaeda leadership but its not as centralized a movement as it was say in 2001 but in some ways the fact that it has spread in the way that it has in my view makes it perhaps more dangerous
7988418 just as the qaeda leadership has been able to reconstitute itself in pakistans ungoverned tribal areas al qaedas north africa offshoot is now running small training camps for militants from morocco tunisia and as far away as nigeria according to the state department and mr droukdal leader of the algerian based militant group al qaeda in the islamic maghreb the state department in april categorized the tribal areas and al qaeda in the islamic maghreb as the two top hot spots in its annual report on global terrorism
7988419 taliban regrouped after its fall from power and have coalesced into a resilient insurgency
7988420 now poses a challenge to the afghan governments authority in some rural areas
7988421 maintain or even increase the scope and pace of its terrorist attacks and bombings in 2008
7988422 the afghan government has not developed sufficient capacity to lead or create change the karzai government continues to have little control or presence outside of kabul and cannot maintain security or provide services and the rule of law in areas outside of the capital
7988423 many afghans are uncertain about the direction of their country and are increasingly frustrated with the failure of president karzais government to extend its authority and services throughout the country and by the lack of improvement in their daily lives six years after the international reconstruction process was launched the taliban have been able to exploit the karzai governments shortcomings to their advantage
7988424 no other country in the world has ever produced narcotics on such a deadly scale
7988425 started to extract from the drug economy resources for arms logistics and militia pay
7988426 by the end of july 2002 bush had approved some 30 projects to prepare for war in iraq that would eventually cost 700 million some of the funding would come from the supplemental appropriations bill for the afghan war and the general war on terrorism
7988427 cause celebre for jihadists breeding a deep resentment of u s involvement in the muslim world and cultivating supporters for the global jihadist movement
7988428 help al qaeda energize the broader sunni extremist community raise resources and to recruit and indoctrinate operatives including for homeland attacks
7988429 operations in iraq have had a negative impact on all other efforts in the war on terror which must bow to the priority of iraq when it comes to manpower materiel and the attention of decision makers
7988430 at least temporarily an incubator for terrorism and have emboldened iran to expand its influence throughout the middle east
7988431 i dont have troops i can reach for brigades i can reach to send into afghanistan until i have a reduced requirement in iraq afghanistan has been and remains an economy of force campaign which by definition means we need more forces there so what were going through right now is an ability to in almost every single case win from the combat standpoint but not unlike the insurgency in iraq we dont have enough troops there to hold and that is key clearly to the future of being able to succeed in afghanistan
7988432 current and former military and intelligence officials said that the war in iraq consistently diverted resources and high level attention from the tribal areas when american military and intelligence officials requested additional predator drones to survey the tribal areas they were told no drones were available because they had been sent to iraq
7988433 according to two former intelligence officials directly involved in the qaeda hunt by 2006 the iraq war had drained away most of the c i a officers with field experience in the islamic world you had a very finite number
7988434 a strategy based on military force has not been effective
7988435 has the opposite effect from what is intended military force is often overused alienates the local population by its heavy handed nature and provides a window of opportunity for terrorist group recruitment
7988436 it is time to re vitalize and re double our efforts toward stabilizing afghanistan and re think our economic strategies to ensure that the level of our commitment is commensurate with the threat posed by possible failure in afghanistan without the right level of commitment on the part of the u s its allies and afghanistans neighbors the principles agreed upon by both the afghan government and the international community at the 2006 london conference and the goals stated in the afghanistan compact will not be achievable
7988437 the united states and the international community have tried to win the struggle in afghanistan without a clear and consistent comprehensive strategy to fill the power vacuum outside kabul and to counter the combined challenges of reconstituted taliban and al qaeda forces in afghanistan and pakistan a runaway opium economy and the stark poverty faced by most afghans
7988438 international efforts engaged in rebuilding and securing afghanistan include over 40 countries three major international organizations and scores of other non governmental organizations they are disorganized uncoordinated and at present insufficient
7988439 comprehensive campaign plan that brings together all of these disparate security reconstruction and governance efforts and coordinates and integrates their work
7988440 it is our assertion that the current afghan government and its allies principally nato and the united states are not winning the battle in the civil sector to create crucial judicial legal and police reforms essential to governance and are losing the fight in curtailing corruption and drug production and creating employment opportunities while nato and other forces are capable of coping with the current military and security threats posed by the taliban and other insurgents unless or until civil reforms are put in place tactical success will not bring political or strategic victory
7988441 since 2002 the u s embassy in pakistan has had no washington supported comprehensive plan to combat terrorism and close the terrorist safe haven in the fata
7988442 the lack of a comprehensive plan to guide embassy efforts and the sense that the pakistani military was the most capable institution in pakistan to quickly undertake operations against al qaeda immediately after the attacks of 9 11 senior embassy officials stated that this may have led to an over reliance on the pakistani military to achieve u s national security objectives in pakistan
7988443 bush administration and military officials said they believed that much of the american money was not making its way to frontline pakistani units money has been diverted to help finance weapons systems designed to counter india not al qaeda or the taliban the officials said adding that the united states has paid tens of millions of dollars in inflated pakistani reimbursement claims for fuel ammunition and other costs
7988444 pakistan prizes f 16s more for their contribution to its military rivalry with india than for fighting insurgents along its afghan border
7988445 excessive speculation on energy trading facilities is the fuel that is driving this runaway train in crude oil prices today excessive speculation is being driven by what michael masters of masters capital management refers to as index speculators as compared to traditional speculators

7988475 we recently received the first report of a suspected ehd deer casualty this year so we want to begin educating hunters and the public about the disease while the virus is often fatal it apparently did not have much of an impact on the delaware deer population as the overall harvest from the 2007 2008 season was the third all time highest if ehd had significantly impacted the deer herd we would have expected the harvest to be down but we didnt see that
7988476 we are in a position of allowing nature to run its course and waiting for a hard frost to kill the midges
7988477 while nothing can be done to prevent the further spread of ehd until colder weather halts the midges from infecting deer the division would like to document deer mortality for research and to obtain data for future references to the disease

7988505 we kept it nice and tight we got that early goal everything was going perfectly
7988506 but there was going to be some stage when we had to push forward and get that second goal
7988507 unfortunately they caught us on the break there and punished us back to 1 1
7988508 then we had to really go for it at least if wed scored wed have taken it into extra time
7988509 it was a wee bit of desperation really but we couldnt go out just lying down we had to give it everything wed got
7988510 to be honest with you i thought they gave everything they had
7988511 we had a couple of little chances with a wee bit more luck then wed have got another goal it just wasnt to be

7988516 after 20 minutes the pilot called nyala airport to tell him the plane had been hijacked and that he is en route to tripoli in libya
7988517 i am worried about my father and mother they are coming from nyala on this flight no one has any information about the situation they are in
7988518 this is the result of what the government is doing in the camps of displaced people in nyala
7988519 im not sure if its connected to kalma but its related to that the government kills and the international community does not intervene what can the darfurian people do

7988522 gustav continues to represent a potential threat to oil and gas installations in the gulf region and will be watched with vigilance
7988523 given the current track for gustav and the expectation that it might enter the gulf of mexico this weekend we are making logistical arrangements to evacuate staff who are not essential to production or drilling operations
7988524 evacuations could begin as early as tomorrow there is no impact on production at this time
7988525 in the face of the danger threatening haiti i ask national civil protection committees and our friends in international cooperation to help the government manage the risks and disasters
7988526 everything about this looks like a strong storm that would evacuate platforms
7988527 i sent my mum a text phone message i love you and i am going down

7988529 experienced an in flight depressurisation incident which caused the oxygen masks on board to deploy
7988530 as a safety precaution the captain descended and diverted the aircraft to limoges airport
7988531 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons he was hyperventilating i looked at the lady on my left and hers hadnt filled up either
7988532 i would say some people thought we were going to die
7988533 for about half an hour no one told us anything we didnt know what was happening at all we were quite panicky
7988534 after half an hour we were told to take the oxygen mask off and then the plane landed and we were fine
7988535 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
7988536 they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
7988537 as the passengers confirmed the pilot did make an announcement once he got down to 8000 feet where it is safe to take the oxygen masks off that they were diverting to limoges
7988538 the irish and french aviation authorities have been notified of this incident and a full investigation of this incident will be undertaken later today
7988539 i think its no secret and ive said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think the settlement activity is helpful to the process
7988540 what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7988541 i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together over this period of time
7988542 so we will continue to press ahead to get agreement so that we know what is in israel and what is in palestine that is ultimately the goal
7988543 initiated 433 new housing units during the period of january to may 2008 compared to just 240 units during the period january to may 2007
7988544 which still continue and which without a doubt are the main obstacle in the political process
7988545 just because we have not yet succeeded does not mean we have failed
7988546 the coming weeks will be decisive for the peace process we are at a crossroads and the efforts and the meetings will continue in order to build on the ideas presented for the first time today
7988547 will continue efforts to reach a historic agreement by the end of the bush administration
7988548 i would like to suggest to my partners not to use it as an excuse and i know they are not using it as an excuse but i understand their frustration sometimes
7988549 there were some small activities but they will not influence the ability to negotiate nor the future borders of the palestinian state
7988550 i thank god who has been with me through this gruelling election process i thank the voters
7988551 the message is clear we have made a demand for change for freedom and for justice
7988552 the people do not want to be exploited we want an economic order that protects all the people
7988553 yes of course we have lost we were the underdogs going into this race

7988562 we will not attend we dont expect any member of the executive to address us until that dialogue has been concluded
7988563 funding arrangements for schools that are riddled with anomalies and flaws

7988565 1 5 billion for government schools would be required merely to reclaim the sector shares in place at the outset of the howard years
7988566 if continued they will result in a cut in real terms for the school system that educates the majority of australian children
7988567 howard government policies benefited non government schools by almost 3 billion in real terms a funding advantage of around 2 5 billion over the real increases provided for government schools

7988570 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7988571 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7988572 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7988573 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and me our country will be committed to his cause
7988574 the work will begin anew the hope will rise again and the dream lives on
7988575 the holy church should have an abundant number of catholics well versed in the languages especially in those of the infidels so as to be able to instruct them in the sacred doctrine
7988576 all bishops must sometimes each year send men well grounded in the divine word to those parts where jews and other infidels live to preach and explain the truth of the catholic faith in such a way that the infidels who hear them may come to recognize their errors let them compel them to hear their preaching
7988577 as long as we continue to govern india in the mild tolerant spirit of christianity we may govern it with ease but if ever the fatal day should arrive when religious innovation shall set her foot in that country indignation will spread from one end of the hindustan to the other and the arms of fifty millions of people will drive us from that portion of the globe with as much ease as the sand of the desert is scattered by the wind
7988578 christianity had nothing to teach hinduism and no missionary ever made a really good christian convert in india he was more anxious to save the 30 000 of his country men in india than to save the souls of all the hindus by making them christians at so dreadful a price
7988579 preserve the laws of the shaster and the koran and to protect the natives of india in the free exercise of their religion
7988580 the company manifested a laudable zeal for extending as far as its means went the knowledge of the gospel to the pagan tribes among whom its factories were placed
7988581 principal efforts made under the patronage of the british government in india to impart to the natives a knowledge of christianity
7988582 the hindoo appears a being merely limited to mere animal functions and even in them indifferent with no higher intellect than a dog
7988583 scurrilous invective without arguments of any kind they were filled with hell fire and still hotter fire denounced against a whole race of men merely for believing the religion they were taught by their fathers
7988584 the plain truth concerning the mass of the indian population and the poorer classes alone is that they are not civilized people
7988585 great philosophy which lives on unchanged whilst other systems are dead which as yet unsupplanted has its stronghold in vedanta the last and the most subtle and powerful foe of christianity
7988586 neither truth nor honesty honor gratitude nor charity is to be found in the breast of a hindoo
7988587 a frightful visage painted black with a distended mouth of bloody horror
7988588 the whole history of this famous god krsna is one of lust robbery deceit and murder the history of the whole hierarchy of hindooism is one of shameful iniquity too vile to be described
7988589 the multitudes who flock to our schools cannot return under the dominion of the brahmins the spell has been forever broken hinduism is not a religion that will bear examination it gives away at once before the light of european sciences
7988590 the most complete system of absolute oppression that perhaps ever existed
7988591 india presents the greatest of all fields of missionary exertion india is a country which of all others we are bound to enlighten with external truth but what is most important to you friends of missions is this that there is a large population of aborigines a people who are outside caste if they are attached as they rapidly may be to christianity they will form a nucleus round which british power and influence may gather
7988592 thus india is like a mighty bastion which is being battered by heavy artillery we have given blow after blow and thud after thud and the effect is not at first very remarkable but at last with a crash the mighty structure will come toppling down and it is our hope that someday the heathen religions of india will in like manner succumb
7988593 at best work of human folly and at worst the outcome of a diabolic inspiration
7988594 we cannot avoid recognizing in the people of hindustan a race of men lamentably degenerate and base governed by malevolent and licentious passions and sunk in misery by their vices
7988595 i am in love with gopia charmed with crishen krishna an enthusiastic admirer of raama and a devout adorer of brihma brahma bishen vishnu mahisher maheshwara not to mention that judishteir arjen corno yudhishtira arjuna karna and the other warriors of the mhabharat appear greater in my eyes than agamemnon ajax and achilles apperaed when i first read the iliad
7988596 hindu imagination is such that it cannot be excited except by what is monstrous and extravagant
7988597 mills view of hindu religion is full of very serious defects arising from inveterate prejudices and imperfect knowledge every text every circumstance that makes against the hindu character is most assiduously cited and everything in its favor as carefully kept out of sight whilst a total neglect is displayed of the history of hindu belief
7988598 from the survey which has been submitted to you you will perceive that the practical religion of the hindus is by no means a concentrated and compact system but a heterogeneous compound made up of various and not infrequently incompatible ingredients and that to a few ancient fragments it has made large and unauthorized additions most of which are of an exceedingly mischievous and disgraceful nature it is however of little avail yet to attempt to undeceive the multitude their superstition is based upon ignorance and until the foundation is taken away the superstructure however crazy and rotten will hold together
7988599 the whole tendency of brahminical education is to enforce dependence upon authority in the first instance upon the guru the next upon the books a learned brahmana trusts solely to his learning he never ventures upon independent thought he appeals to memory he quotes texts without measure and in unquestioning trust it will be difficult to persuade him that the vedas are human and very ordinary writings that the puranas are modern and unauthentic or even that the tantras are not entitled to respect as long as he opposes authority to reason and stifles the workings of conviction by the dicta of a reputed sage little impression can be made upon his understanding certain it is therefore that he will have recourse to his authorities and it is therefore important to show that his authorities are worthless
7988600 shown to be fallacious and false by the ithuriel spear of christian truth
7988601 who could deny that a single shelf of good european library is worth the whole native literature of india and arabia are we to teach false history false astronomy false medicine because we find them in company with false religion the intrinsic superiority of the western literature is indeed fully admitted by those members of the committee who support the oriental plan of education the superiority of the europeans becomes absolutely immeasurable
7988602 all the historical information which has been collected from all the books written in the sanscrit language is less valuable than what may be found in the most paltry abridgements used in preparatory schools in england
7988603 the question now before us is simply whether when it is in our power to teach the english language we shall teach language in which there are no books on any subject which deserve to be compared to our own whether when we can patronize sound philosophy and true history we shall countenance at the public expense medical doctrines which would disgrace an english farrier astronomy which would move laughter in girls at an english boarding school history abounding in kings thirty feet high and reigns thirty thousand years long and geography made up of seas of treacle and rivers of butter i would at once stop the printing of arabic and sanscrit books i would abolish the madrassa and the sanscrit sic college at calcutta
7988604 it is my belief that if our plans of education are followed up there will not be a single idolator among the respectable classes in bengal thirty years hence and this will be effected without any efforts to proselytize without the smallest interference with religious liberty by natural operation of knowledge and reflection i heartily rejoice in the project
7988605 indian in blood and color but english in taste in opinion in morals in intellect
7988606 no hindu who has received an english education ever remains sincerely attached to his religion
7988607 look we have real intrinsic righteousness its not infused but its actual you cant say we dont believe in spirit wrought intrinsic righteousness
7988608 we all know what the gospel is now let us go on to the christian life
7988609 we all know how to breathe so lets forget about breathing and get to exercising
7988610 any one who denies any form of acceptance with god on the basis of spirit wrought sanctity or righteousness

7988633 by spending our it dollars to buy the monitors docking stations and keyboards for a one time purchase ourselves we have saved significant money over paying the it contractor over three years to rent the equipment
7988634 if the equipment fails we will have to spend out of pocket but the overall savings will cover the failures
7988635 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7988636 experts who have studied motor vehicle fatality trends said one reason for the dramatic decline is that people are reducing their nonessential driving first which is often leisure driving at night or on weekends that also happens to be riskier than daylight commuting on congested highways at lower speeds teenage and elderly drivers who also have higher accident rates are more likely to feel the pinch of higher gas prices and thus may be cutting back more than other drivers federal data also shows that driving declines have been more dramatic on rural roads which have higher accident rates than urban highways and some drivers are simply trying to save on gas by slowing down which also decreases risk
7988637 it is a virtuous cycle where high gas prices lead to lower speeds and smaller cars
7988638 the kind of money generated around the industry is way out of proportion the admiration bestowed on actors is also out of perspective
7988639 doctors are the stars of our society people like my grandfather who was responsible for the health care in canada as well as teachers firefighters and police officers

7988703 germs viruses and other microorganisms are usually present but merely as scavengers that feed on toxic wastes while we must thank louis pasteurfor annihilating the belief that disease was caused by demons and evil substituting in its place the germ theory we must not forget that bechamp who was a contemporary of pasteur strongly maintained that the chemical background on which the germ fed was of equal importance man had to choose between the two causes of disease either the toxic background due to faulty living and eating habits was responsible for disease or a mysterious microorganism hiding in dark corners pounced upon the innocent and unsuspecting victim the cure according to this latter theory depended upon the destruction of these microbes
7988704 despite proof to the contrary many doctors still cling to the germ theory of disease and to the necessity of drugs to combat germs they point out that smallpox diptheria typhoid fever and pneumonia have been conquered that is true no one can quarrel with them on that score but such chronic disorders as cancer heart disease diabetes arteriosclerosis nephrosis and hepatitis have increased eightfold scientific medicine while suppressing deadly infectious diseases by the use of moderndrugs antibiotics and immunizations has not been able to reduce the killing power of another equally frightening set of diseases instead of blindly following pasteur as so many medical men have done i asked myself is invasion of the tissues from without by bacteria and viruses the only way by which human tissues are injured can disease come from other means shouldnt mans constitutional and environmental conditions also be considered hasnt the time come to expand our notions of illness and treatment beyond pasteurs bacterial infection theory can it be possible that germs are merely a concomitant of disease present in all of us but able to multiply in a sick individual because of disturbed function in seeking answers to these questions i left pasteur and his tiny organisms and went off on another road i came to the conclusion that germs do not initiate a diseased state of the body but appear later after a person becomes ill
7988705 every new concept developed in medical science points the way to a new area awaiting further exploration discarding both the use of drugs and the germ theory of disease opened the way for me to explore new methods of eliminating the stagnating waste products from the body briefly stated my position is improper foods cause disease proper foods cure disease

7988842 its interesting growing up in the west coast the winternationals in pomona calif is always the big race for me but every racer who has raced for several years will tell you that the u s nationals is the one that kind of completes the resume

7988844 im looking forward to this weekend and heading back to fontana because i feel that some of our best cars of the season were at michigan and thats the track that we always compare to fontana it seems that our 1 5 mile and 2 0 mile track programs are right around where we need them to be so far this season we had a great car out here earlier in the spring but we ended up with some splitter damage but overall i think we would have been able to have stayed in the top 15 that race a lot has changed since we were here in february and a lot of what we have learned over the summer we will apply to the car for this weekend and be very competitive right off the truck when we get there
7988845 we had a pretty good showing earlier this season when we raced at california for the first time back in february unfortunately the last time we were at fontana we were unable to qualify due to the rain and weather but were looking forward to being able to qualify well this weekend i always compare california and michigan as the two very similar tracks on the circuit and we have run very well at michigan both times this year the car were bringing we ran at both pocono races so it is a fairly new car in our fleet but were feeling very confident going into this weekend
7988846 i think bringing craig aboard is going to help the team

7988848 there is always pressure on us in some form or another but the schumacher electric suzuki has been running great and im feeling good and im ready to go
7988849 i just want to go out there and do a good job this is the longest race of the year and its going to be a new experience for me to be able to go home every night and sleep in my own bed i think that will be a big benefit
7988850 to win at what is now my home track would be awesome and the fact that its the u s nationals would make it even better

7988992 i am so glad that i found trivita as a strong business model to follow their idea of buying customers maps instead of the usual way of conducting a network marketing business by buying leads has produced such a rich roi that i cannot see myself pursuing any online business in another way
7988993 trivita is not just another home business deal it is a real way to improve your business profitability the roi on money invested will become much more substantial if one follows the guidelines set forth by trivita and consistently buy customers each month

7989027 for that reason any new egyptian attempt to mediate the dispute is doomed to failure
7989028 this is primarily due to the fact that cairo doesnt want to see hamas become a successful example of islamic governance in the region
7989029 as it now stands egypt is completely biased towards fatah which itself has a close relationship with israel
7989030 both hamas and pa president mahmoud abbas were elected by the palestinian people in 2006
7989031 egypts national interest requires neutrality and the avoidance of taking sides
7989032 the egyptian government is taking part in the siege and forbidding the entry of material aid into the starving territory

7989036 so all youll need to do is go purchase the appropriate bracket id not go any bigger than 4x4

7989039 well im not going to do it trust me you do not want me to do it
7989040 we put the toilets back in and then check to make sure they arent leaking

7989047 because bats can detect objects with echolocation they seldom collide with man made structures
7989048 an atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforeseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
7989049 given that bats are more susceptible to barotrauma than birds and that bat fatalities at wind turbines far outnumber bird fatalities at most sites wildlife fatalities at wind turbines are now a bat issue not a bird issue
7989050 slow reproductive rates can limit a populations ability to recover from crashes and thereby increase the risk of endangerment or extinction
7989051 we intervene in the hardware stream and say how about a virtual network and that is starting to ramp up
7989052 we started to buy commercial suites like xensource now owned by citrix or vmware but we always hated their licensing programs and the way they tried to limit growth so we wound up back at xen org
7989053 we pitch the idea that were pragmatic rather than the latest and greatest we know how to operate a cloud really effectively by using tried and true tools and one of them is xen we showcase that were involved in the project and they would much rather have their applications in a stable environment than a supercharged always failing environment
7989054 we were into coldfusion and j j allaire adopted linux early weve developed on top of linux ever since
7989055 i find myself always gravitating to the gnu type projects they are the best way to develop venture backed applications with the amount of creativity coming out of the community and the value right out of the box you realize a real benefit by always using foss
7989056 the other day i was looking around the office and realized we use a lot of linux applications
7989057 we didnt set out to build the company on linux but we wound up doing that because everything just fits we use
7989058 we still have to use exchange but were about to move over to an exchange knockoff with a great feature set called kerio
7989059 i was like any business owner but we have to buy so many support contracts for clients servers hardware and you start to realize theyre not really interested in supporting you it used to be dell had this four hour support contract and it was easy to get them to do the work as time has gone on they have changed that we went to dell the other day and they wanted us to troubleshoot you have to go through all the troubleshooting before they will dispatch a part the more i see that the more i say i would rather rely on the community discussion boards its all right there and i can just get it rather than having to social engineer my way through tier one support
7989060 but we do get to see the net effect of all the software as it is running on diverse systems and we contribute back support we keep an active wiki and dump chunks of it back into the community to help the discussion sugar rolled out a revision recently and we saw the broken parts within minutes we let people know and many people avoided upgrading to that release were not stellar code contributors but we do play a role
7989061 the principal flexibility of open source is unlocked by being able to leverage many php or java developers to produce your vision
7989062 with a network company the advantage of open source is even clearer if you have a programmer you can string together an entire systems desk by using open source connectors that work together and that looks like a large network management company the advantage is i get the same efficiency as a enterprise grade product at much lower expense
7989063 we took four cars to bristol that were much better than even their finishing positions showed
7989064 our cars were well prepared and the speed and talent of our four drivers were evident throughout practice and the race we had a few issues on pit road that cost us some spots and obviously the no 1 car had a tire failure early that ruined their night but we are very proud of the promise all four cars showed
7989065 all four were among the fastest cars at bristol and were optimistic that success will carry over for the rest of the season
7989066 our testing and engineering programs have been making good progress and we expect great things out of all our young guys
7989067 this year indy is quite a bit different from last year
7989068 last year was the first time for the countdown and we were quite a bit ahead in points much like no 1 in points tim wilkerson is right now and then of course they reset the points
7989069 i think in 2007 a lot of people kind of questioned how to approach it properly and obviously we proved that you dont have to be leading the countdown to win the championship
7989070 im really looking forward to seeing my team tested because it looks like were either going to be sixth or 10th in the points best case scenario is we will be in sixth place which is still going to put us quite a few points behind first 70 im really excited to see how my napa guys are going to react
7989071 i truly believe weve got the best leader there is in the pit area when you have to go to battle on race day
7989072 and this weekend its the u s nationals the granddaddy of all drag races its a race where you need aces intensity and his experience at a place like indy
7989073 and then on top of that we have the showdown for 100 000
7989074 ive been lucky enough to win it three times 1998 1999 2002 i think that success has been because ive been around good experienced racers in the past and ed mcculloch has taught me so much and this is a place where you really have to rely on that
7989075 the knot at the very end is two stops less than the middle knot f 4
7989076 weve got richard hogan tuning the car who has been in the shop for a week going through refining trying to find a combination that he will be comfortable with
7989077 hes working with todd hes working with phil shuler tuner of rockstar energy drink dodge john collins our assistant crew chief and everybody on the don schumacher racing team
7989078 everybody seems to be upbeat and going in a good direction its risky doing this before the u s nationals its great that youve got an extra qualifying session five in all but youve also got a bunch of cars coming and everyone is trying to be a hero and so are we
7989079 theres been a lot of changes a lot of things going on hopefully we can get a handle on it all and cause havoc on all these guys who are going to be in the countdown
7989080 one thing that im really excited about is sons dominic 11 and giovanni 6 are leaving with me today to head back to indy
7989081 we love indianapolis we have a lot of friends there and the boys and i are going to play with go karts were going to go to a friends house and do some swimming go to some neat restaurants and just have a great time before mom julie gets in on thursday night
7989082 so hopefully the motor home wont be a disaster by the time she gets there and all of us will be in one piece and ready to race on friday
7989083 we want gator fans to enjoy the excitement of outdoor activities like football games but we also want them to be safe from the dangers that come with overexposure to the sun

7989085 the fact that so many children are growing up in poverty is a disgrace some will try to spin these numbers as an improvement but lets keep the political back slapping to a minimum these numbers are not numbers to be applauded the high rate of poverty in buffalo represents people who need real economic development that invests in people small businesses and neighborhoods hard working families in buffalo deserve better the economic prosperity of all residents of buffalo should be the lens by which we make all of our decisions as a community

7989091 in racial division they are not interested they are sort of bored with it
7989092 the most open discussion of race since the civil rights movement in many ways that is a wonderful moment
7989093 are sometimes reluctant to see what they worked for come to fruition which is a nonracist society because they really want that to happen but it is very difficult to give up on
7989094 it opens your eyes to the concept that black talent is much wider and much more expansive than you thought it was
7989095 everything has changed now and it has become much more complex at that time i touched a very raw nerve as the memory of the 60s was much closer
7989096 it is like othello everybody focuses on the fact that othello is black it is the least important thing about him
7989097 who wants to talk about issues when you can talk about oh hes black
7989098 it would do a great deal for americas image of itself and i dont mean young black boys and girls who can say with a loud resounding voice i can i can
7989099 every person can say this truly is a place that if you work hard enough and if you have the right skill set then you can do anything you want to do that is what america always stood for

7989108 when trading you are committing your money to something that you have no control over so you have to do it in a way to keep yourself out of trouble you need a system to help you in volatile markets

7989110 im very happy with the end result working with max guiterrez was a great experience he really translated the lyrics into a beautiful piece of cinematic art the day of the shoot i was confronting issues i had been holding inside for years you can see this in my face all the home movie footage is authentic raw and very real this is a glimpse into my life that i never thought i would share
7989111 its been a crazy ride since the idea for this record first came about in the back of a tour bus two years ago as i was bored out of my skull and wanting new music to work on its been nothing but a great experience working with peter wichers ex soilwork dirk verbeuren soilwork and matt wicklund ex himsa and i must say i feel pretty lucky to have worked with great musicians throughout my career dating all the way back to sanctuary and of course nevermore i feel fortunate that this record has been so well received and look forward to playing these tunes in a live situation

7989119 the eastern portion of the fault has moved at a predictable rate and the earthquake activity associated with it has been what we would expect
7989120 but the western part of the fault has been lagging in terms of the number and size of earthquakes it seems to be straining absorbing the motion
7989121 it could mean that the fault is getting ready for a large earthquake or it could mean that the movement has been so gradual that we couldnt detect it
7989122 land stations also detected a four fold increase in the number of earthquakes along the blanco fault in 2008 compared to background rates
7989123 our monitoring may be missing a lot of earthquakes that are less than 3 0
7989124 the western side of the fault may be experiencing a series of mini quakes that we cant detect or it could be slowing creeping along in a way we cannot measure
7989125 but we cant discount the possibility that its energy hasnt been released and it will some day in the form of a good sized earthquake
7989126 you need quite a bit of vertical displacement on the ocean floor to generate a tsunami

7989130 its the unusual toe pads and clinging ability of some geckos that make them such a fascinating group of animals so we were very fortunate to find such a well preserved foot in this fossil specimen
7989131 theres a gecko society gecko clubs just a lot of interest in these animals because of their unusual characteristics
7989132 so there are a lot of people pretty excited about this
7989133 geckos are territorial and when i lived in africa in the early 1980s we used to have them in our house
7989134 they are pretty friendly and dont bother humans certain individuals would move into the house wed give them names and they would run around the house catch mosquitoes help control bugs they would crawl across the ceiling and look down at you

7989183 do you get the feeling that michelle obama accomplished what she set out to do because i definitely i definitely do after watching from television you know on television last night
7989184 yeah i think the bar was set pretty high and i think she went over that bar and probably then some
7989185 it was a special night for them i think the democrats should be very happy
7989186 talk about a bar set high for her to get over in terms of reintroducing herself to the american public
7989187 so all of those stories this was a speech that if it were a painting norman rockwell would have painted it this is the american dream this is what the american spirit is all about
7989188 america was reintroduced to barack obamas wife michelle last night at the democratic convention her speech brought the delegates to their feet
7989189 we talked a little earlier with jeff greenfield about a bar set so high it seems i think theres pretty much a consensus that she got over it
7989190 alright so all of this yummy gummy good feeling kumbaya last night
7989191 so we are seeing that she is setting a trend not just in politics but really in everybodys everyday lives
7989192 she set a high bar oratorically am i saying that right in terms of the speech that she gave what about fashion wise style wise did she exceed
7989193 i think she succeeded i think thats exactly what shes going for because today were talking about the message more than just the overall bling
7989194 so we are seeing that she is setting a trend not just in politics but really in everybodys everyday lives

7989196 we werent very good in practice friday night but the crew worked hard to get the car better before race time we didnt know what we would have until the start of the race but the car ended up pretty good in the center and under throttle we just needed to get the rear of the car hooked up more because we fought a loose condition all night this race always takes patience because its so long the attrition rate helped us and i knew if we could be there at the end we would come away with a decent finish
7989197 ive never had a good finish at bristol but after we qualified eighth i thought maybe this time would be different for us i was wrong early on in the race we got taken out by the no 1 car when they blew a tire it took almost 100 laps to fix the car and then after i got back out on the track i didnt have any brakes and we had to come back in again that set the tone for the rest of the race and i just counted laps wishing it was over somehow we finished 34th which is better than i thought wed end up for some reason bristol just does not like me

7989209 then it dawned on us mcsames subliminal attack ads were stoking the deep rooted latent racism of white middle america we needed to warn these uneducated simpletons that mcsame was exploiting their superstitions and genetic bigotry the big question was how

7989227 its a sizeable agreement and were going to take a close hard look at it
7989228 we plan to evaluate a group of women with lam who are experiencing shortness of breath for the presence of pulmonary hypertension
7989229 we will look at participants medical history pulmonary function tests exercise tolerance echocardiogram results and previous biopsy samples
7989230 we are hopeful this information will increase our understanding of how lam can manifest in the patients it affects in the future this information may be useful in developing better management strategies for this disease
7989231 some participants will be seen once in clinic and undergo testing with an echocardiogram while participating in this study
7989232 the individuals who have already undergone a clinical pulmonary hypertension evaluation may be able to participate through a review of select medical records and lung biopsy specimens
7989233 its a big idea in one sense in that its an area thats central to the north side of holland and the south side of holland

7989235 we learned a lot of things from that village project
7989236 our administration has committed 60 million to recapture the glory of the bridge and to restore it so it can improve the quality of life in both of the communities that it connects
7989237 species invasions and extinction the future of native biodiversity on islands
7989238 the presumption at the time was that we are driving biodiversity to lower levels
7989239 certainly if you think about it at the global level this is true because humans have done a lot of things that have driven species extinct
7989240 what dov and i worked on a few years ago is the fact that the vast majority of introductions of species dont have large negative effects
7989241 indeed most species that get introduced dont have much effect at all it doesnt mean that theyre not altering the ecosystem but theyre not driving things extinct like some of the big poster child stories weve been hearing about
7989242 the dramatic increase in the number of species has changed how the system functions
7989243 changing the abundance of natives versus exotics affects all of the other species that used to depend on the natives for food or shelter so its not in any way to say that increasing biodiversity is a good thing
7989244 that by going in and mucking up the system we may have already created the setting where too many species have been packed in and we just havent waited long enough to see these extinctions start to happen
7989245 the whole point of this study was to start looking down the path to see which of these wildly different scenarios might be right
7989246 we havent nailed the answer yet but weve set the stage for answering whether islands are now saturated or not
7989247 it was very surprising to find such a strong correlation between the number of native and exotic plant species on islands around the world
7989248 in ecological research a strong correlation often explains 50 percent of the variation here the correlation between native and exotics explains almost 100 percent of the variation in other words if you know how many native plants are on an oceanic island then you can predict almost perfectly how many exotic plants are there
7989249 if you reduce uric acid at least in some patients you may be able to reduce blood pressure
7989250 this could be one way people develop hypertension and may allow us to develop new therapies
7989251 this is far from being a reasonable therapeutic intervention for high blood pressure but these findings indicate a first step in understanding the pathway of the disease
7989252 you cannot prevent a disease until you know the cause this study is way of finding that out
7989253 the antihypertensive therapies available to patients are well proven and safe
7989254 currently available antihyperuricemic therapies treatments that lower uric acid are not safe enough to be used as first line therapy for most people with high blood pressure

7989274 what god teaches about himself in his word is of utmost importance to the issues of her personal daily life
7989275 theology is the root foundation and framework for practical living that reflects wisdom and understanding
7989276 do you identify christ as the head of your body and live like he is the brains of your operation does your life reflect the supernatural connection you have to the rest of his body are you living in community with your brothers and sisters in his body or in isolation from other believers does your relationship with the church show that you believe that you are members of one another or do you disobey pauls instructions by living as if you dont need the other members it is not enough to have a head knowledge of these doctrines we must examine ourselves daily to see if we live out these teachings if not we must take our thoughts captive and make them submit to the truth of gods word
7989277 this pattern of associations with earlier age of nonmelanoma skin cancer diagnosis being linked more strongly to the risk of developing subsequent malignancies is consistent with the pattern that one would expect for a marker of inherited predisposition to cancer
7989278 however since 1978 more than 80 cases of lead poisoning associated with ayurvedic medicine use have been reported worldwide
7989279 several indian manufactured rasa shastra medicines could result in lead and or mercury ingestions 100 to 10 000 times greater than acceptable limits
7989280 a 2005 institute of medicine report concluded that the regulatory mechanisms for monitoring the safety of dietary supplements should be revised the constraints imposed on fda u s food and drug administration with regard to ensuring the absence of unreasonable risk associated with the use of dietary supplements make it difficult for the health of the american public to be adequately protected
7989281 new fda regulations and current indian policies do not specify any maximum acceptable concentrations or daily dose limits for metals in dietary supplements for domestic use we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing
7989282 because few interventions in critically ill adult patients reduce mortality to this extent the results of this trial were enthusiastically received and rapidly incorporated into guidelines
7989283 these recommendations have led to worldwide adoption of tight glucose control in a variety of intensive care unit icu settings
7989284 given the overall findings of this meta analysis it seems appropriate that the guidelines recommending tight glucose control in all critically ill patients should be re evaluated until the results of larger more definitive clinical trials are available
7989285 possible explanations for the discordant results of the study by van den berghe et al and the meta analysis by wiener et al are that the meta analysis is flawed the studies that form the basis of the meta analysis are flawed or inherently different or the findings of the study by van den berghe et al occurred due to random chance or as a result of another unique factor interacting with tight glycemic control
7989286 those investigating tight glycemic control should take a step back and address the fundamental questions of defining quality standards for tight glycemic control finding affordable methods of frequent and highly accurate measurement of blood glucose in the icu and conduct multicenter efficacy studies to determine if tighter glycemic control can reduce mortality under optimal conditions if tighter glycemic control can be proven effective in optimal conditions determining how to make that benefit available to millions of critically ill patients in both developed and resource poor countries around the world would be a truly worthwhile challenge there is no simple or clear answer to the complex problem of glycemic control in critically ill adults at present targeting tight glycemic control cannot be said to be either right or wrong
7989287 the results of this study represent a potentially new therapeutic approach that of control of a biochemical cause of hypertension rather than nonspecifically lowering elevated bp although not representing a fully developed therapeutic strategy this study raises an alternative strategy that may prove to be more effective than currently available options
7989288 despite these findings this clinical trial is a small one and allopurinol is not indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adolescents or other populations the potential adverse effects of allopurinol including gastrointestinal complaints and especially stevens johnson syndrome a severe allergic reaction make allopurinol an unattractive alternative to available antihypertensive medications more clinical trials are needed to determine the reproducibility of the data and whether it can be generalized to the larger hypertensive population nevertheless the observation that lowering uric acid can reduce bp in adolescents with newly diagnosed hypertension raises intriguing questions about its role in the pathogenesis of hypertension

7989303 howard countys athletic programs are one of if not the best high school athletic programs in the country and michael and mike are two of the best at what they do it was an honor to have them as presenters
7989304 it was very flattering for bob and patrick to recognize ud for so many parts of the university the center for international studies athletics the provosts office the college of health sciences the office of service learning and alumni relations that have contributed to the efforts i hope that we can continue our programs and work with fiba more in the future to further develop basketball coaches and administrators around the globe
7989305 its not just about volunteerism though that is very important
7989306 when we do service learning we really look at combining our disciplinary knowledge with problem solving that comes with experience
7989307 students gain civic awareness and they can witness firsthand the power of service along with another key element knowledge this not only allows students and faculty to institute service learning in the summer program but also can be integrated with other current projects
7989308 it is really great to see how this program has grown over the past three years
7989309 the irish government is looking for a number of ways to immerse immigrants in irish culture and they were looking at basketball as a way to get immigrant communities submersed in this culture
7989310 last year we had a grant from the irish government that funded a program that brought two national basketball association players to ireland this year the program is tied in with the university of notre dames mens basketball team
7989311 our students helped develop print radio and television ads and they dealt with the irish consul the united states embassy and the polish embassy on this initiative
7989312 they were able to make a contribution to help cultural integration in ireland and also enjoyed a real life experience to go overseas and see a beautiful country like ireland
7989313 comparing energy expenditure of young adults with autism and typically developing
7989314 we know that there are a lot of people who are overweight and that this is even more so among people with autism
7989315 we also know that there has been a significant increase in the number of people diagnosed with autism we wanted to know if the increase in obesity in people with autism is due to their condition or a social problem
7989316 energy expenditure in people with autism is something that needs to be looked at we set up our goals for what we wanted to accomplish each week and reported weekly to dr getchell
7989317 part of our success in this project was due to our interactions with the students we were working with we are hoping to get our findings published

7989344 minister roches comments that a second lisbon referendum was needed has confirmed the publics fear that the government despite claims that it would respect the result of the lisbon referendum intends to re run the lisbon vote when the time is right and an effective pro treaty marketing strategy has been put in place
7989345 while the government claims it will make no decision on this matter until after its detailed analysis of the referendum defeat has been completed and considered it is clear that it intends using the findings of this research to present to the public with the same rejected treaty dressed up as something new
7989346 contained within the text of a new treaty but would be hidden and disguised in some way
7989347 irish people must not allow our government treat us with such contempt our politicians must be respect their constitutional duty and obey the sovereign will of the voters
7989348 the people are fed up with politicians avoiding giving answers
7989349 its time for openness and honesty in politics prior to the result of the referendum minister roche claimed that there would be no second vote if we said no but now in typical fianna fail fashion he is reneging on that position
7989350 the government is using taxpayers money to mount an extensive confidential poll to clarify the reasons underlying the referendum result but intend withholding the results from the public
7989351 despite repeated calls the government has refused to state if it will make the findings of this research public as soon as it is available
7989352 to withhold the findings of this research from the people who are paying for it is unjustifiable and implies the government intends using the information to circumvent the will of the people its elected to serve

7989477 justice minister rob nicholsons announcement about a non existent law to protect pregnant women is nothing but a ploy to change the channel on the right to choose issue an issue that conservatives want to avoid at all costs the conservatives are trying to fool canadians into believing they are the great defenders of womens rights when their track record proves otherwise
7989478 what does it say about the conservative government under stephen harper that the majority of his mps including cabinet ministers voted in favour of mr epp s bill

7989493 these settlements are supposed to be the nail in the coffin of any future peace agreement with the palestinians

7989496 we are connected to the water grid we have phone lines from the national company bezeq we have been hooked up by the electricity company and have street lighting
7989497 we also have a kindergarten paid for by the state and a group of soldiers stationed here to protect us how can we be illegal
7989498 we can also see all the arabs from here and keep an eye on what they are doing
7989499 and in addition we can see the other settlements and check on their safety
7989500 they are very afraid that this will become simply the first of many settlements to fall
7989501 the settlers know that preparation of an alternative site could take years
7989502 the danger is that migron will be destroyed only to be resurrected in legalised form by the government as a new settlement close by adam

7989512 i told them this today what we do at times is we try to revert back to 0 and 12 and 1 and 11 habits
7989513 you know dukes so amazing in basketball i think it would be extremely possible for them to succeed at anything they try to do so i think that if duke really pours its effort into football like its been doing i think we stand a good chance

7989531 blue like jazz is for a college audience that goes to movies every weekend whereas most movies developed within christian circles seem pitched to older audiences that go once or twice a year a few of the investors weve met have kids who love the book but its not like i can wait around until daddy retires this movie like the book doesnt have a ready precedent which is one of the reasons i want to make it but that lack of precedent makes investors uncomfortable that and the sweat that pours off me when i sit in high backed leather chairs

7989590 we had 200 and something people at an event last night yesterday evening in i dont think those folks consider themselves corporate insiders all those families and folks that were out
7989591 this announcement from the group quote the august 14 fort myers town hall and august 21 west palm beach town hall will be rescheduled as a result of tropical storm
7989592 its ironic that guys like him and global warming extremists will use any weather event whether its a hot spell whether its a hurricane or a tropical storm or a hailstorm or a snowstorm anything any weather event theyll try to tie it to their pet cause which is ideological extremism at its worst
7989593 then there is alan collinge who for years has described his struggle with tens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt to anyone who will listen
7989594 he has appeared on 60 minutes criticizing sallie mae the nations largest student lender and has been quoted in the pages of this and other newspapers attacking loan companies
7989595 representatives of loan companies are not fond of mr collinges tactics
7989596 he has called loan company executives at home to criticize their corporate policies and sent the occasional profanity laced e mail message to lender advocates
7989597 mr collinge acknowledges that at least some of the e mail messages and phone calls he has made were inappropriate but he maintains that the sentiments expressed were genuine
7989598 his words may simply reflect the resentment of thousands of borrowers who are too embarrassed to talk about their debts publicly
7989599 i think that a lot of women when they think about moving towards government run system of health care which is really what sen obama is talking about theyre going to be a little bit cautious
7989600 they recognize that while free health care or however sen clinton and sen obama wants to bill it could be really expensive at the end of the day and create lower qualities of care and higher quality of care is really what most women are concerned about
7989601 he touches all the bases so he very definitely is targeting women and he needs to because without consulting hillary or even pursuing her for the vice president position hes lost ground with women and he obviously thinks his health care plan will be something that will get women on board
7989602 obama believes government should require insurers to accept all applicants and would force insurers to charge basically the same premium for everyone regardless of age gender occupation or pre existing conditions a healthy young person would pay about the same as a 62 year old with heart disease and diabetes
7989603 it is a for profit system and unless we have a not for profit system we wont have health care for everyone
7989604 ladies and gentleman the coverage of barack obama was embarrassing
7989605 running for the most important office in the world obama got basically a free pass
7989606 the problem for amtrak of course though is that they havent had a single new passenger car since 1990
7989607 their cars even the locomotives are old and aging theyre asking congress for help dick durbin has introduced legislation into the senate to try and do something about that interestingly he says that thanksgiving is going to be a wake up call for americans as we all try to go visit relatives for the holidays
7989608 i mean not just the trains because a lot of those routes they need to be able to get more people moving
7989609 the most cost effective alternative in our part of the world
7989610 this could be a tough sell another fund paid for by the fuel tax is in trouble the federal highway trust fund the fund faces a multibillion dollar shortfall next year due to the decrease in driving down from a surplus of more than 10 billion just three years ago
7989611 but instead reveal a still troubled system losing market share and riders in its key service areas
7989612 whether fannie and freddie are liquidated or nationalized as a prelude to privatization in their current form they wont be missed
7989613 this is an outrage 200 million shares of each were trading today its very clear that someone knows whats happening now one of the things were supposed to have you know we have this organization called the sec it was really fabulous and i have to be facetious because its just too unbelievable the new york stock exchange another organization the companies themselves they used to stop trading when it was clear that there were some people who knew what was going on and others dont
7989614 there isnt anyone who just says wait a second this is outrageous
7989615 go back to 1929 then lets just have a free fire zone for everybody other than the ultra rich lets drive everybody out and make this into the club that is piping rock the club that is just a bunch of rich people sitting around and saying haha look at those chumps i know what paulsons saying

7989660 the results keep demonstrating that changing to circular hooks is the right choice since it favors turtle conservation without having an impact on the economy of artisanal fisheries
7989661 together with fishermen we are building a culture for sustainable fishing practices that will guarantee fish stocks in the long term
7989662 our goal is to reduce the incidental catch of marine turtles from the long line fishing operations without affecting the fisheries activity which is a main source of food and income for local communities
7989663 this program is going beyond an initial focus of saving sea turtles from bycatch and is creating the groundwork toward sustainable artisanal long line fishing in the eastern pacific
7989664 by working cooperatively collecting data and learning how to improve practices this program is living proof that conservation and industry can work together for sustainability

7989739 how do you think council should approach development in the local government area
7989740 we always felt yass valley was the countrys best kept secret but it seems the secret is out
7989741 weve had positive growth over the last few years and with the expansion of canberra yass valley is becoming a more and more desirable place to live
7989742 the people who live in yass valley have always known its a great place to live and work
7989743 but its nice to get outside recognition of this fact
7989744 we arrived and moved straight into our home which shows the area is very well organised we found the people up at the visitors centre were a great help were happy with the schooling its a very good community
7989745 it should have been left the way it was that area is one of the oldest catholic cemeteries in country nsw people seem to think theres only one grave up there but thats not true other people are buried there thats a fact we just dont know the dimensions of the burial site
7989746 we had intensive gpr ground penetrating radar tests done on the area and it found theres nothing but rocks there
7989747 im not a selfish person i want more people to come live in yass i could have kept that land for myself but instead theres an opportunity for another twelve people to come and live in yass
7989748 go down the main street and ask business owners whether they would like to see new families move to yass its obvious know what the answer would be
7989749 i got away from the whole professional look of putting the camera on a tripod and having perfectly level horizons and perfect composition and perfect lighting where it looks like it was shot on a sound stage into more of the mtv or gonzo style

7989752 a lot of young men see our videos and i dont want to give them the impression that barebacking is ok that overall trend has had a negative effect on the business its especially bad in the twink niche studios are exploiting the na vet of the young men who arent old enough or maybe educated enough to understand the risks theres some exploitation going on there which i think is sad
7989753 some of the studios are using guys that are purposely made to look very young almost like theyre not adults that troubles me a lot and thats a trend im glad we dont do
7989754 there are even studios out there that have gone beyond the whole barely legal look and have gone into the barely male look boys who look like theyre one step away from the surgery
7989755 what i cater to are the people who appreciate the diversity and the sensuality of young men in all their flavors
7989756 i dont do a whole lot of set ups and scripting but i try to do just enough set up or dialogue so the viewer can buy into the scenario once theyve done that their imagination takes over its more enjoyable to them if it looks believable

7989768 i have a tremendous sense of relief i must say

7989785 weve been talking with staff in different parts of the midwest and were all struggling to some extent with the problem of white workers who will not vote for barack obama because of his color theres no question about it its a very powerful thing to get over for some folks

7989790 costigan believes hopes that the number of people holding racially negative views is relatively small and that mr obama now with the help of senator biden can surmount that obstacle
7989791 surmounting it will be tough not only do the polls show this to be a close race but the polls when it comes to senator obama cannot be trusted it is frequently the case that
7989792 after many years of watching black candidates run for public office and paying especially close attention to this years democratic primary race ive developed my own very arbitrary rule of thumb regarding the polls in this election
7989793 take at least two to three points off of senator obamas poll numbers and assume a substantial edge for senator mccain in the breakdown of the undecided vote using that formula barack obama is behind in the national election right now
7989794 i wont vote for candidate a because of the tint of his skin and the shape of his nose and the suspected allegiances that we associate with people of his sort
