4830363 obamas 2006 trip to kenya evidenced his continued ties to a raila odinga a fellow luo tribesman who was running for president of kenya as a muslim sympathizer with well known communist political roots
4830364 obama by being seen this prominently with odinga in public had injected himself into the presidential contest on the side of his tribesman
4830365 senator obama has continued to insert himself into kenyan politics
4830366 morriss showing up in kenya makes no sense outside the obama odinga connection
4830367 morris had been openly critical of hillary clintons campaign against obama
4830368 please let the smearing continue otherwise our candidate cant win
4830369 as we shall see rezko was persistent ultimately convincing obama to drop working for political organizing causes so he could supplement the dwindling advance he had received at harvard to write a book with real income as a lawyer working the small chicago law firm where the lead partner did much of rezkos slumlord legal work for him
4830370 obama could work for rezko indirectly and benefit from rezkos connections
4830371 the likelihood is that rezko played a role in getting obama to join davis miner barnhill amp galland
4830372 alinsky taught that power was everything and that image words and positioning were just methods to capture power working from communities up
4830373 took steps that helped davis and rezko in their business relationship

4830375 there is no record that illinois state senator obama ever so much as placed a speech in the record objecting to the public housing practices perpetuated in his district by tony rezko let alone calling for investigation of rezko and his business practices
4830376 in an article titled obama is one lucky fellow rezko watch found it was unlikely that sreenan would actually construct any condos on the lot he had bought from rita rezko
4830377 even if no illegality is ever identified obamas continued willingness to take campaign contributions from his friend rezko even after serious allegations about rezkos low income housing empire began to be raised have the feel of impropriety
4830378 investigative reporters have drawn a line from obama to rezko to saddam husseins oil for food scandal with the key connecting point being billionaire nadhmi auchi

4830384 obama has consistently refused to support legislation that would define an infant who survives a late term induced labor abortion as a human being with the right to live
4830385 he insists that no restriction must ever be placed on the right of a mother to decide to abort her child
4830386 obama on the floor of the illinois state senate said that woman had an absolute right to abortion to kill the baby even if it survived that abortion

4830408 since germany was responsible for the war she was liable for the costs and damages incurred by the victors
4830409 we have written a document that guarantees war in 20 years when you place conditions on a people germany that it cannot possibly keep you force it to either breech the agreement or to war either we modify that agreement and make it tolerable to the german people or when the new generation comes along they will try again

4830424 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4830425 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most

4830431 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4830594 iraqi security forces will partner with the 41st fires brigade and occupy several checkpoints and patrol bases previously manned by the 1st georgian brigade
4830595 right now the iraqi soldiers have taken over the responsibility of the traffic control point but we are going to train them to be able to take over the entire patrol base
4830596 the georgian forces had no experience they didnt know how to fight they didnt follow army orders thats why their duties were to man checkpoints and search cars
4830597 the departure of the georgians is a good thing theyre just the same as the other occupation forces the iraqi forces are quite capable of taking care of security

4830643 heres a woman thats successful takes care of herself looks amazing and she took the steps to get there it doesnt happen unless you take charge shes a great role model for many many women
4830644 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
4830645 i was in high school when she hit it big
4830646 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
4830647 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
4830648 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
4830649 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
4830650 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
4830651 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
4830652 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
4830653 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
4830654 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
4830655 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
4830656 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself
4830657 im sure shes happy to be an inspiration to women and men of any age
4830658 is not quite the benchmark for her as it seems to be in the media who have been talking about her 50th since she turned 40
4830659 fda has concluded that an adequate margin of safety exists for bpa at current levels of exposure from food contact uses
4830660 i think he alonso had a dead leg so we needed to protect him a little bit
4830661 after plessi was injured so we used xabi the game was more open for his passes
4830662 torres is a key player he can change games for a striker you talk about goals he can score these type of goals which is very important
4830663 you could see the team was really focused and concentrating on trying to win
4830664 the best news for our supporters is to win games
4830665 we tired in the last 15 20 minutes but the players did very very well im very pleased with them
4830666 its a fine line at this level youve got to take your chances against teams like liverpool
4830667 we just didnt do enough to get over the finishing line and get a draw theyve got players like torres and gerrard who will punish you thats why the premier league is so tough
4830668 without a doubt this is one of the best places to see music in the city
4830669 obviously to win the game we had to score and i think when you dont score in a game like that when youre so dominant in terms of possession and territory there is always a danger that something like that could happen
4830670 its frustrating but from my perspective watching it it isnt rocket science there were things that werent quite good enough and therefore there are things we can improve on that i think would make a difference so we would have won a game like that
4830671 it was the same last week we defended poorly and we defended better today saturday but around and inside their box we didnt really look like we would score
4830672 youve got to score it quinns header but we didnt and the longer the game goes on like that you worry something would happen and when they got the free kick you think here we go its almost inevitable
4830673 were disappointed but not despondent weve not done badly and we can see where we can improve so back to the training ground to start again
4830674 i dont think there was a headbutt i think it was just a bit of frustration but i didnt see a headbutt
4830675 its a hard hard club to come and play for with the high expectation levels theyre learning quickly and theyll need to learn quickly
4830676 it was a massive result with two good teams getting beat last week and getting away from the nil
4830677 weve had to battle we lost 14 away games last season and it cost us dearly in the end and you need to come to difficult venues like this and scrape and scratch and get results we can play a lot better as motherwell can but its a vital victory
4830678 the two of them are a hard as nails stephen craigan enjoys it you know youre in a game against him hes a very honest lad
4830679 i thought it was a silly tackle on stevie hammell and hell have to lose it you cant go about like that in scottish football but its his enthusiasm and he got booked and rightly so
4830680 im not doing an arsene wenger here i honestly didnt see that
4830681 the universe took 13 7 billion years to produce this amazing book
4830682 trying to understand reality without an evolutionary worldview is like trying to understand infection without microscopes or the structure of the universe without telescopes
4830683 its not merely difficult its impossible these are not the end times for humanity they are just the beginning earth is billions of years old and we only emerged a few million years ago a geological blink of an eye fossils were not put here to test our faith they were left behind by a divine creative process that made everything we experience around us and within us fossils teach us faith by showing proof positive of the grace that has guided us safely through deep time to the present moment

4830722 i have been in the hood for a while now
4830723 its a very very awesome prison i majored in architecture in college and design is how i actually started in for super max designing that prison it had to be the kind of thing that was a character in and of itself
4830724 were in a world where instead of just trying to contain a guy whos really big youre trying to contain a guy who can in the case of icicle who can freeze things
4830725 to escape from super max they have got to go through the most elaborate heist weve ever seen involving superpowers because the prison itself kind of has superpowers
4830726 the prison changes shape cells rearrange and reconfigure every night to disorient the prisoners from breaking out a transforming super prison
4830727 i see him as the jason bourne of superheroes a guy who exists with his own sort of set of tricks and i think the difference between ollie queen and a guy like bruce wayne theyre both rich they both have their things but batman is about his equipment and is about his theatricality and about his detective skills and green arrow is a guy whos really just the sort of macgyver type

4830790 its an historic opportunity and i think it hearkens back to the values people had when the wilderness act was first published in 1964
4830791 an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man where man himself is a visitor who does not remain
4830792 were very concerned with this big mass push for wilderness thats going on right now
4830793 there are better choices in todays world for protecting that land and preserving the access thats so needed for recreation
4830794 chose to ignore wilderness proposals even when there was a great deal of consensus in support of them

4830805 2do not forget to entertain strangers for by so doing some people have entertained angels without knowing it 3remember those in prison as if you were their fellow prisoners and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering

4830818 your true worth is determined by how much more you give in value than you take in payment
4830819 but the point isnt to exceed peoples expectations so they will pay you more its to give them more because you love to its a way of life when you do then very very profitable things begin to happen
4830820 all the great fortunes in the world have been created by men and women who had a greater passion for what they were giving their product service or idea than for what they were getting and many of those great fortunes have been squandered by others who had a greater passion for what they were getting than what they were giving
4830821 your compensation is directly proportional to how many lives you touch
4830822 compensation is directly proportional to how many lives you touch
4830823 first it means that you get to determine your level of compensation its under your control if you want more success find a way to serve more people it also means there are no limitations on what you can earn because you can always find more people to serve
4830824 let us so live that when we come to die even the undertaker will be sorry

4830827 always be a first rate version of yourself instead of a second rate version of somebody else
4830828 the most valuable gift you have to offer is yourself
4830829 reaching any goal you set takes ten percent specific knowledge or technical skills ten percent max the other ninety plus percent is people skills and whats the foundation of all people skills liking people caring about people being a good listener those are all helpful but theyre not the core of it the core of it is who you are it starts with you as long as youre trying to be someone else or putting on some act or behavior someone else taught you you have no possibility of truly reaching people you want people skills then be a person
4830830 the world certainly was designed with a sense of humor inside every truth and every appearance theres a bit of opposite tucked inside
4830831 the key to effective giving is to stay open to receiving
4830832 receiving is the natural result of giving if you give and then try to stop the receiving that comes back youre like king canute watching the tide roll out and commanding it not to come back in it has to come back in just as your heart has to contract after relaxing
4830833 the secret to success to gaining it to having it is to give give give the secret to getting is giving and the secret to giving is making yourself open to receiving

4830880 the scope of conservative media is vast the ability of the right wing media apparatus to dominate public discourse is at the expense of liberal and progressive values and represents a fundamental transformation in american politics this is what we are fighting against
4830881 over the past two decades conservative media has had a huge impact and the results are disconcerting first most conservative media uses an ideological propaganda model that results in a more ignorant audience
4830882 the top down delivery model of right wing rhetoric traces a path directly from the white house and conservative think tanks to fox news rush limbaugh and a whole host of conservative talk shows these messages are repeated and further reinforced on the editorial pages of the and other newspapers creating a right wing echo chamber alternet is working hard with many partners to build the progressive echo chamber that will fight back
4830883 at first i thought it was funny and flattering but its tiresome now ive seen magazines where plastic surgeons are saying if you want a butt like this it has to be fake and im just like dude have you ever seen an armenian girl before i love that im curvy but im on this major kick to try and lose weight especially in my butt im just so over it when youre posing on the red carpet and the paparazzi shout turn around turn around it gets a little offensive

4830887 contemplative prayer bridges the gap between belief and experience because it is the bridge of faith
4830888 look carefully at what you most despise in yourself and then look through it at your center you will discover a love for me beyond words images and concepts a love you are unable to understand or contain your love for me is fragile but real trust it

4830890 the content of this dream is more real than the book you are holding in your hand the dream is neither the product of a vivid imagination nor a comatose religious fantasy

4830894 whatever cuts across my will outside of myself or whatever wells up from the collective unconscious from within myself
4830895 hes right in pointing out that we have spent too much time and energy on redemption centered spirituality and we have to look into a creation centered spirituality
4830896 do you see why the revelation of jesus on the nature of god is so revolutionary do you see why no christian can ever say one form of prayer is not as good as another or one religion is not as good as another

4830902 the church as the visible body of the lord is committed to global freedom to active participation in the construction of a just social order and to stimulating and radicalizing the dedication of christians the holy alliance between charismatic spirituality which he later came to call paschal or contemplative spirituality and liberation theology serves to vitalize the churchs action in the world and to make its commitment to the lordship of jesus deeper and more radical
4830903 the subject of miroslav tich is so large and replete with ramifications that i almost dont know where to begin
4830904 it occurs to me that this whole scenario of a make believe funeral is exactly like something the heroine of gone with the wind would do the first time i saw the movie i cried when bonnie blue butler died after falling off the horse i thought it was cruel of margaret mitchell to kill off an innocent child now i realize it was probably a good decision i know what its like to grow up with a mother like scarlett

4830910 weve worked hard to make pokerpro a highly secure and feature rich product and look forward to introducing automated
4830911 its a hard hard club to come and play for with the high expectation levels theyre learning quickly and theyll need to learn quickly
4830912 it was a massive result with two good teams getting beat last week and getting away from the nil
4830913 weve had to battle we lost 14 away games last season and it cost us dearly in the end and you need to come to difficult venues like this and scrape and scratch and get results we can play a lot better as motherwell can but its a vital victory
4830914 the two of them are a hard as nails stephen craigan enjoys it you know youre in a game against him hes a very honest lad
4830915 i thought it was a silly tackle on stevie hammell and hell have to lose it you cant go about like that in scottish football but its his enthusiasm and he got booked and rightly so
4830916 im not doing an arsene wenger here i honestly didnt see that
4830917 obviously to win the game we had to score and i think when you dont score in a game like that when youre so dominant in terms of possession and territory there is always a danger that something like that could happen
4830918 its frustrating but from my perspective watching it it isnt rocket science there were things that werent quite good enough and therefore there are things we can improve on that i think would make a difference so we would have won a game like that
4830919 it was the same last week we defended poorly and we defended better today saturday but around and inside their box we didnt really look like we would score
4830920 youve got to score it quinns header but we didnt and the longer the game goes on like that you worry something would happen and when they got the free kick you think here we go its almost inevitable
4830921 were disappointed but not despondent weve not done badly and we can see where we can improve so back to the training ground to start again
4830922 i dont think there was a headbutt i think it was just a bit of frustration but i didnt see a headbutt
4830923 i think he alonso had a dead leg so we needed to protect him a little bit
4830924 after plessi was injured so we used xabi the game was more open for his passes
4830925 torres is a key player he can change games for a striker you talk about goals he can score these type of goals which is very important
4830926 you could see the team was really focused and concentrating on trying to win
4830927 the best news for our supporters is to win games
4830928 we tired in the last 15 20 minutes but the players did very very well im very pleased with them
4830929 its a fine line at this level youve got to take your chances against teams like liverpool
4830930 we just didnt do enough to get over the finishing line and get a draw theyve got players like torres and gerrard who will punish you thats why the premier league is so tough
4830931 the way people communicate deep involvement in social change in discourse in subculture has gone from being a below ground analogue language of worn spray painted or stitched symbols to the daylight of blogs message boards and other digital mouthpieces
4830932 the most powerful book other than scripture that i have ever read
4830933 because including it would exclude all buddhist and many faith groups with different views of god and the divine
4830934 envision the great religious traditions arranged on the circumference of a circle at their mystical core they all say the same thing but with different emphasis
4830935 the contemplative has a unified vision and experience of the one truth shining out in all its various manifestations he does not set these partial views up in opposition to each other but unites them in a dialectic or an insight of complementarity
4830936 looks upon human nature as fallen but redeemed flawed but in essence good
4830937 we have been restored to a right relationship with god
4830938 in any other great world religion it is unthinkable to address almighty god as abba
4830939 in healing our image of god jesus frees us of fear of the father and dislike of ourselves
4830940 more on behavior than on consciousnesson doing gods will and performing the devotional acts that please him than on experiencing god as god truly is
4830941 emphasize s the need for a change in consciousness a new way of seeing god others self and the world
4830942 the christian of the future will be a mystic or he or she will not exist at all by mysticism we mean a genuine experience of god emerging from the very heart of our existence
4830943 mysticism is nothing more than a faith contrary to rationality deprived of content and incapable of communication you can bear witness to it but you cannot discuss it
4830944 the task of contemplative prayer is to help me achieve the conscious awareness of the unconditionally loving god dwelling within me
4830945 what masters of the interior life recommend is the discipline of centering down throughout the day
4830946 the first step in faith is to stop thinking about god at the time of prayer
4830947 without moving your lips repeat the sacred word or phrase inwardly slowly and often
4830948 simply return to listening to your sacred wordgently return your mind to your sacred word
4830949 after a twenty minute period of prayer which manning recommends twice daily conclude with the lords prayer a favorite psalm or some spontaneous words of praise and thanks
4830950 and when you pray do not use vain repetitions as the heathen do
4830951 i saw people going through in ten days what it might have taken twenty years to go through at a monastery
4830952 the ego has to break and this breaking is like entering into a great darkness without such a struggle and affliction there can be no movement in love
4830953 it is a comfort to know that this is a path that others have tracked before us
4830954 several local churches i have visited in which religiosity has pushed jesus to the margins of real life and plunged people into preoccupation with their own personal salvation

4831002 the fact that the carry trade appears to be ending is an indication that institutional investors are concerned the global economy is slowing
4831003 the euro zone reported a 0 2 gdp decline for q1 including declines in germany and france its two largest economies theres concern about a substantial slowing in the united kingdom and we know about the u s economic distress the pull back in the carry trade is a statement by institutional investors that they expect the worlds major economies to slow in q3 and q4 if not longer
4831004 capital continually scans the world in search of return and yield when that capital starts returning home in this case with the tapering of carry trades in the cheap yen thats a signal that institutional investors believe the global economy is slowing
4831005 so look for the global economy to continue to slow through q4 of this year

4831031 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4831032 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4831033 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4831034 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4831035 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4831042 i principi della riforma sono indiscutibili dubito per che per molti servizi di base che dovranno essere garantiti dalla lombardia alla puglia sar possibile definire un costo standard

4831045 the political economy of a water and sanitation reform process
4831046 what we have is a very elderly population that will stay here we will continue to have multiple chronic conditions such as cancer heart disease and obesity that are going to require more nursing care
4831047 so what were trying to do here is come up with creative strategies so as to prevent a real dire shortage of nurses in this state
4831048 were an isolated market and although therell be some competition for these nurses most of that competition will come from local facilities like doctors offices
4831049 they ask why am i learning this and then later in their lives they realize they should have been listening
4831050 looking way back we estimated about 7 000 acres in vegetation near its peak in 1987
4831051 tva used to do a survey of it and last year it was estimated to be about 4 500 acres
4831052 there hasnt been a survey this year but i think the acreage has gone up since last year weve definitely seen an increase
4831053 nowadays coontail is predominant and theres a lot of spinyleaf naiad and curlyleaf pondweed
4831054 plus theres some chara milfoil and even some hydrilla with a big bed near fenton and i hear a bunch of it down around paris landing tenn
4831055 from our perspective of producing fish the weeds are a good thing
4831056 the weeds support a lot of bugs living in them and little fish show up to eat them and those attract bigger fish its a food chain thing it creates lots of new habitat
4831057 the grass just gives more places for fish to hide
4831058 it lets more little bass get started and ends up producing more bigger fish
4831059 a while back people were winning tournaments with five fish limits weighing 15 or 16 pounds then it got to where you needed about 17 pounds
4831060 now in almost all tournaments its taking more than 20 pounds to win because everybody is catching more
4831061 there may be some that worry that the grass is going to make it hard to fish but everybody that comes here to fish leaves knowing that its a positive thing
4831062 around our docks its not so bad but with the weeds growing and the water level coming down it may knock out the use of our open boat slips by september
4831063 the bottom line is we need someone who can take responsibility
4831064 we need someone not to eliminate the weeds because theyre good for the fishing but who can keep lake accesses boat docks and swimming areas open
4831065 you really need to be aware of restrictions on the pesticide use and licensed applicators are trained for that
4831066 you really want to think twice about pumping poisons into the lake
4831067 software as we know it is the bottleneck on the digital horn of plenty
4831068 it takes up tremendous resources in talent and time its disappointing and hard to change it blocks innovation in many organizations
4831069 where do i begin to tell the story of how great a
4831070 the economy is the issue and within that are the high gasoline prices
4831071 were pointing fingers at them democrats because theyre in charge
4831072 unfortunately since this is an election year some of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have refused to put politics aside so that we can develop a comprehensive energy policy for our nation
4831073 nancy boyda time and time again has voted against more american energy more american jobs and lower gas prices
4831074 in domestic policy the american political system is glacial in how it works in getting something changed
4831075 the energy problem has been a problem for years obviously
4831076 this is whats going to solve this problem down the road

4831085 i could see him slowing down and im still pumping to the line
4831086 i dont think theres any way anyone could have beaten him with a run like that today
4831087 youve got a young guy doing things that havent been done before hes a freak of nature you guys saw it for yourself i just happened to have a front row seat
4831088 i didnt even know i got the world record until after i finished the victory lap actually i wanted to come in and be olympic champion i did that so i was happy with myself
4831089 i think its exciting for our program for people to feel that way about us fires me up
4831090 theres a lot of responsibility that goes along with it but lets face it football world thinks weve got a shot and they are holding us in high esteem right now and we need to do everything in our power to keep it there
4831091 it means nothing until you get out there on the field and prove it
4831092 so we got to go out there and play football the way we know how and see what happens coach does a good job of keeping us grounded and i think were smart enough to realize that we play in the sec a tough conference and its not going to be just given to you
4831093 i gave it my best theres definitely no regrets to walk away with a silver im pretty happy
4831094 i was picturing the new zealand flag in the middle to be honest and i was picturing that gold medal round my neck its coming i tell ya
4831095 im not saying the doctors were wrong but im not saying they were right
4831096 to do what ive done is something i can be proud of
4831097 it hasnt been easy theres been many ups and downs
4831098 i came in here with expectations of riding a personal best
4831099 it feels so great to have exceeded expectations and to be riding for a medal
4831100 i just have to go back home and reflect on what went wrong really i was so confident i had the form of my life
4831101 i just have to get my chin up and come out fighting again in two days
4831102 its a miracle for an actor to have a job last 28 years
4831103 im so in love with you whatever you want to do is all right by me
4831104 i guess china is obsessed with winning olympics gold medals and we should take inspiration from it in india there is no dearth of talent but a lot needs to be done to utilise it in a proper manner
4831105 the response here is tremendous and i am very happy on coming back home but i want to remain away from all this hype as i am very exhausted and want to take a long break
4831106 i consider the finals of the 10 meter air rifle event as the most exciting final of my life
4831107 for the last 12 years i was following only one thing in life and had only one hobby which is shooting my concentration did get diverted in the beginning but gradually i calmed myself and reached my goal
4831108 our boxers are doing extremely well and i am praying for them to win medals we should not pressurize them by creating any hype before the results and let them concentrate on their game plan
4831109 india has to win at least 30 40 medals to become an olympics power of the world cricket is a popular sport in india and rules the hearts of the masses in fact i myself love watching cricket
4831110 we are running a abhinav sports trust with a sole aim of churning out future champions now we are planning to intensify its work we will select budding youngsters from any sport and provide them world class infrastructure and training facilities
4831111 in five years time i can turn this city around
4831112 you cant even run a house when you have more than one owner so how can you operate a city with so many different bosses
4831113 estoy feliz por el tiempo que hice pero no puedo conformarme
4831114 era mejor parar y as evitar un da o superior
4831115 it is so freaking amazing i cant explain what is going through my head right now

4831118 los indignados empiezan a ocupar el lugar de los indignos en am rica
4831119 and it got even more frightening when you saw the others
4831120 theres a lot of comment being made that it looks fake or it looks like a suit
4831121 but these people wasnt there when i was sweating pulling this thing through the woods
4831122 im just asking them to sit and watch because youre going to eat your words
4831123 i believe that the eu reaction should have been more decisive
4831124 the russians should have been told that imperial times have ended and that if russia does not want to find itself in international isolation it must abandon such policy and thats that
4831125 once again it turned out that in actuality decisions of this organisation the eu were being taken between berlin and paris agreed the position with chancellor angela merkel whose voice proved to be decisive
4831126 saying that the european union has a common policy towards russia is a joke because what policy would that be submissiveness
4831127 i dont believe russia is pursuing a policy of annexation and i also dont believe that there will be a return to the previous status quo for south ossetia and abkhazia
4831128 the starting point of the military confrontation was georgias march into south ossetia we shouldnt confuse things
4831129 in my view we have seen major mistakes by the west in its policy towards russia
4831130 the long lasting conflict in south ossetia has had a significant impact on the environment including the degradation depletion and mismanagement of natural resources
4831131 environmental degradation and the use of natural resources are identified as factors that could deepen contention in areas of existing conflicts as in abkhazia south ossetia
4831132 incentives for illegal exports of valuable timber and endemic tree species from the conflict areas of georgia
4831133 the resulting conflict lasted throughout 1991 causing thousands of casualties and creating tens of thousands of refugees on both sides of the georgian russian border

4831140 estoy muy contento y no encuentro las palabras y todos vieron cu nto me emocion
4831141 every intent of the thoughts of the heart was only evil continually
4831142 imagination is one of the noblest faculties with which man has been endowed a faculty indeed the sound and proper use of which is not only necessary to the existence of sympathy and other social affections but also intimately connected with those higher exercises of soul by which men are enabled to realize the things that are not seen and eternal
4831143 to realize the things that are not seen and eternal
4831144 works of imagination are not the dessert of education they are the meal
4831145 humility a true sense of my unworthiness in relation to the creator and the created universe is the key to wonder the door to true imagination
4831146 the secondary world of imagination is made in fact out of the primary world and this is the key part it reveals or
4831147 now what i want is facts teach these boys and girls nothing but facts facts alone are wanted in life plant nothing else and root out everything else you can only form the minds of reasoning animals upon facts nothing else will ever be of any service to them
4831148 there is something strange in the modern mind by which a material cause always seems like a real cause
4831149 the assumption is that reality is pretty much what bare science says it is blocks of chemicals and cells of organisms pushing off each other everything visible and measurable
4831150 stories frame a childs interior life for living in this world
4831151 though i couldnt prove it in an ecclesiastical court im beginning to suspect that parents who dont enjoy fiction must have some serious spiritual problem lurking about either in a very distorted view of spirituality or in a rejection of beauty they are like the person who ungratefully refuses to delight in gods handiwork in nature time will tell in the lives of their children
4831152 all of this is the origin of the one distinctly human thing the story
4831153 fantasy remains a human right we make in our measure and in our derivative mode because we are made and not only made but made in the image and likeness of a maker
4831154 we need in any case to clean our windows so that the things seen clearly may be freed from the drab or triteness or familiarity from possessiveness
4831155 fantasy is made out of the primary world but a good craftsman loves his material and has a knowledge and feeling for clay stone and wood which only the art of making can give
4831156 the gospels contain a fair story or a story of a larger kind which embraces all the essence of fairy stories
4831157 exactly what the fairy tale does is this it accustoms him by a series of clear pictures to the idea that these limitless terrors have a limit that these shapeless enemies are enemies that these infinite enemies of men have enemies in the knights of god that there is something in the universe more mystical than darkness and stronger than strong fear
4831158 why would i pay a dollar for one of the games on your site when
4831159 you can make these up to one week in advance
4831160 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
4831161 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
4831162 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
4831163 its not how young you are its how old you arent

4831168 obviously to win the game we had to score and i think when you dont score in a game like that when youre so dominant in terms of possession and territory there is always a danger that something like that could happen
4831169 its frustrating but from my perspective watching it it isnt rocket science there were things that werent quite good enough and therefore there are things we can improve on that i think would make a difference so we would have won a game like that
4831170 it was the same last week we defended poorly and we defended better today saturday but around and inside their box we didnt really look like we would score
4831171 youve got to score it quinns header but we didnt and the longer the game goes on like that you worry something would happen and when they got the free kick you think here we go its almost inevitable
4831172 were disappointed but not despondent weve not done badly and we can see where we can improve so back to the training ground to start again
4831173 i dont think there was a headbutt i think it was just a bit of frustration but i didnt see a headbutt
4831174 i think he alonso had a dead leg so we needed to protect him a little bit
4831175 after plessi was injured so we used xabi the game was more open for his passes
4831176 torres is a key player he can change games for a striker you talk about goals he can score these type of goals which is very important
4831177 you could see the team was really focused and concentrating on trying to win
4831178 the best news for our supporters is to win games
4831179 we tired in the last 15 20 minutes but the players did very very well im very pleased with them
4831180 its a fine line at this level youve got to take your chances against teams like liverpool
4831181 we just didnt do enough to get over the finishing line and get a draw theyve got players like torres and gerrard who will punish you thats why the premier league is so tough
4831182 im a big fan i love your work im absolutely certain
4831183 gosh and all this time i thought it was because producers want you to buy both the box set and the obvious title they left out no they would never do that would they
4831184 its a hard hard club to come and play for with the high expectation levels theyre learning quickly and theyll need to learn quickly
4831185 it was a massive result with two good teams getting beat last week and getting away from the nil
4831186 weve had to battle we lost 14 away games last season and it cost us dearly in the end and you need to come to difficult venues like this and scrape and scratch and get results we can play a lot better as motherwell can but its a vital victory
4831187 the two of them are a hard as nails stephen craigan enjoys it you know youre in a game against him hes a very honest lad
4831188 i thought it was a silly tackle on stevie hammell and hell have to lose it you cant go about like that in scottish football but its his enthusiasm and he got booked and rightly so
4831189 im not doing an arsene wenger here i honestly didnt see that
4831190 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4831191 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good

4831229 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4831230 my mother was triumphant youre finally playing your roots instead of the english rose
4831231 still it was a very fine line not to go completely over the top
4831232 our son is now into monsters thank god so theyre kind of on the same level now

4831234 when i knew she was doing it it was a big shock basically
4831235 in england shes a very big actress and when i found out she was playing my mum i thought that such a big actress wouldnt talk to me but she was very friendly she gave me a lot of advice she and eddie marsan who plays my dad were like my parents on set
4831236 like helena well shes half i dont think a lot of critics knew when she was getting the part and didnt believe she could pull it off but we both had to put it on a little bit
4831237 a big fan of shoes that give you some height with comfort
4831238 they just called me for this its a bit worrying i guess just to be asked to play a sociopath its s interesting to be called a bit off its sort of natural casting
4831239 with a movie like sixty six youre like this is the way to go

4831248 if you are paying a fine with someone elses money there is no personal accountability
4831249 when i talk to the public that offends them more than anything
4831250 i want to create a disincentive to breaking the rules
4831251 its going to pass when the public forces the legislature to do it
4831252 if someone knowingly or intentionally does something wrong they ought to pay their fine using personal funds not campaign funds
4831253 but this is an issue that deserves full debate in the legislative session
4831254 hes perfectly fine if the legislature wants to have that debate hes going to do everything to see that he doesnt get fined in the first place

4831266 i came in here with expectations of riding a personal best
4831267 it feels so great to have exceeded expectations and to be riding for a medal

4831269 i just have to get my chin up and come out fighting again in two days
4831270 it is so freaking amazing i cant explain what is going through my head right now

4831277 hes been helping out the corners letting us know if youre playing a little too far off or youre playing this way thats why i did this route
4831278 watching film the end man on the line always blocked down on me he never let me come free

4831324 obviously its practice number 16 and we had a late night practice yesterday that was pretty tough and physical we then bounced back this morning with a scrimmage and i thought we did some good things the first offense was able to score against the second defense and the defense was able to force the offense into a couple of three and outs so i was pleased there
4831325 we have a few positions especially at guard where were still searching for a guy to step and fill a role for our football team but we feel good about our receiving corp and the way our quarterbacks and running backs are playing we just have to stay healthy defensively its tough to tell right now because we have so many guys hurt we know well get them back prior to our season opener but we need to get them back as quickly as possible so they can be more involved with the game plan
4831326 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

4831349 the person with the least votes determines how the talks should go
4831350 mugabe must go red card for mugabe the world stands with zimbabwes people
4831351 we are here to let the sadc leaders know that any negotiations without the wishes of the people will not succeed and thats what we are here for
4831352 we dont want elite talks aimed at parceling out power we want talks that will benefit all the people and as women we are pushing for our recognition its not too late
4831353 the differences are irreparable both parties want power but they are not prepared to share it we now have to take the matter away from politicians and establish a government of national unity to run the country for two years then we can have fresh elections
4831354 sadc and au must put a timeline to these talks they cannot drag on like this if they fail then a transitional authority headed by neither mugabe nor tsvangirai should be put in place
4831355 yes the talks have been problematic but we have to acknowledge that they are offering an alternative the only problem is that they are being held in secrecy and they are elitist they are sort of alienating political leaders from their constituencies the peoples voice is not visible
4831356 if this is not the case the mdc should return to its constituency and consult the people on further action
4831357 the most important thing is that the talks have offered ordinary zimbabweans a chance to breathe after being choked by violence and given political parties time to reflect on what is going wrong in zimbabwe
4831358 its time for sadc to rein in mugabe because democracy is being subverted when the person with the least votes determines how the talks should go its a fraud if they are failing to agree then they should try something else a transitional authority is the way to go
4831359 we would rather prefer a transitional authority for two years at most we will not be under any illusion that sadc will provide an answer to the zimbabwean crisis the deal that sadc is negotiating for is elitist for us its aluta continua
4831360 will it be better if you never choose this road afterall

4831363 the dove flew above me as i looked up to the sky to see a cloud in the shape of an angel which looked as if it was watching over me making sure i was
4831364 i should have been angered by her sauciness but somehow i felt an answering smile spring into my eyes it seemed absurd all of a sudden that i should expect so much from the opposite sic when a pair of fine eyes was all that was needed to bestow true happiness it is a happiness i have never felt when listening to a woman sing or play the piano and i doubt if i ever will
4831365 but elizabeth who was not in the least mortified at being used so ill merely smiled mischievously and said that we looked so well together the group would be spoilt by a fourth then wishing us goodbye she ran off gaily like a child who suddenly finds herself free of the schoolroom as i watched her run i felt my spirits lift i felt as thought i too was suddenly free free of the trammelled dignity of my life and i longed to run after her
4831366 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4831367 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4831368 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4831369 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4831370 strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age appropriate sex education
4831371 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4831372 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question
4831373 we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life weve done a good thing
4831374 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4831375 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
4831376 is deliberately misrepresenting the facts about our plan in order to shift attention away from the democrats shameful record
4831377 her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices

4831426 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4831427 is there any need to have anti virus software installed in ones computer especially if the person visits the net regularly
4831428 why do computers in worlds most secure places get infected when they afford to have the best protection against viruses
4831429 viruses are made by anti virus companies not all but a few these companies also make their anti dotes or virus definitions the motives behind such a working are to make new customers and retain the old ones the old customers or the ones that already have the company software are retained by giving them the virus definitions that are developed by the company against the viruses made by the same company the new customers are made by infecting those pcs that use an anti virus from the rival company
4831430 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4831431 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4831432 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4831433 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4831434 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4831435 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4831436 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4831437 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4831438 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4831439 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4831440 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4831441 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4831442 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4831443 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4831444 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4831445 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4831446 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4831447 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4831448 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4831449 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4831450 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4831451 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4831452 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4831453 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4831454 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4831455 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4831456 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4831457 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4831458 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4831459 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4831460 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

4831473 uh huh see what they did they traded the drivers life for the childs he was scheduled to be killed in the world trade center bombing
4831474 what does he want those monkeys for when he has us
4831475 theyre different from us theyll serve him in a different way
4831476 how by giving him glory adulation how can he expect anything from them crawling around in the trees i think its a waste of his time i dont like it
4831477 our interest in him is merely a result of yours
4831478 so have you you traded his life for the drivers the day he was born
4831479 we all changed when we went away from the light
4831480 he did it to mock god the truth is not in him elissha he is the father of lies father of our war
4831481 he stopped talking to us he locked us below the waters
4831482 you thought you could rise up against him and not be punished i told you no good would come of questions
4831483 you gave up all this because of those pathetic creatures
4831484 does this satisfy your hatred for the humans does this reaffirm your place in the cosmos
4831485 we didnt intend this to become a dumping ground for the souls he doesnt want
4831486 who stirred them up against him who attempted insurrection in heaven
4831487 the humans have a saying ask me no questions and ill tell you no lies
4831488 ask me no questions and ill tell you nothing at all
4831489 its time we got back to william walton isnt it
4831490 who gives a shit if you are inconvenienced or disappointed its nothing to us
4831491 we have just enough religion to make us hate but not enough to make us love one another
4831492 as a pastor i know you can learn a lot about a mans character by how he treats his family
4831493 barack is a strong man of christian faith who has been married to his wife michelle for 16 years
4831494 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4831495 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4831496 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4831497 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4831498 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4831499 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4831500 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4831501 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4831502 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4831503 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4831504 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4831505 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4831506 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4831507 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4831508 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4831509 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4831510 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4831511 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4831512 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4831513 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4831514 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4831515 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4831516 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4831517 who are open to doing something on the production side
4831518 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4831519 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4831520 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

4831530 what happens on monday is entirely different from whats happening on tuesday wednesday thursday and friday
4831531 research and strategy are not as flashy as a funeral march
4831532 any interest by the state county or local government in keeping that hospital open
4831533 im not going to do something unless there is a reasonable chance to make it happen
4831534 no other credible alternative to protect the safety and well being of the american people
4831535 the fact that this event is even taking place is significant
4831536 it could provide an opportunity for barack obama to make some inroads but i think youll see john mccain stressing his conservative credentials
4831537 usually they go republican the fact that obama is in there with a chance of maybe getting a share of that vote is in some respects a great triumph for him
4831538 to be perfectly blunt its hard to imagine al gore or john kerry doing very well at this kind of a forum but barack obama speaks very movingly about issues of faith and values
4831539 my first quick lap was very slightly compromised by traffic but my next lap put me up to third and the one after got me into second i had to try and get pole and my final run was a real take your brain out one its nice to do a banzai lap like that and at the chicane it was a case of aim the gun and fire it the team told me i could take the chicane flat out in a camper van maybe but it was a bit wild in a leon tdi it wasnt a very technically precise lap so i think i lost a little bit of time in other places its a big challenge to balance attack with finesse at knockhill but i was quite pleased with my final time with 36 kilos on board
4831540 having run with 36 kilos of ballast in the two free practice sessions qualifying was the first time wed run the car today without weight the car obviously handled differently and even my fastest lap was a little bit scrappy i only did nine laps so ive saved my tyres for race day and qualifying one and two is a great result for the team jason did a great job to get the car on the front row of the grid and the aim tomorrow will be to try and make sure he scores as many driver championship points as possible

4831639 so if we gave you a term sheet along these lines would you accept it
4831640 when this first occurred i said whatever the republicans do with their delegations we will do the same the difference is we will have a food fight in the middle
4831641 it seems our party cannot avoid having a free for all
4831642 it has always been my opinion that the michigan delegation would have a full vote at the convention
4831643 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
4831644 democrats in florida and michigan must know they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
4831645 michigan and florida did suffer through this process its not as though they werent held responsible for the decision to move their primaries up
4831646 we had a circular firing squad and everyone fired their weapon fortunately no one was hit and now weve decided to move on
4831647 i have never heard of what youre talking about i will put my hand on a bible
4831648 of course by all accounts the divorce was completely amicable after john and carol mccains divorce there was apparently some confusion about belongings that were roberta mccains but we understand the court papers were unintentionally filed and the matter never went further in the legal system it went nowhere and was of no consequence
4831649 had no knowledge of the suit he did not authorize the suit or participate in its filing
4831650 you can be sure that i talked to and got the permission of any client who is listed as a plaintiff
4831651 i dont think it took more than 15 minutes of his time
4831652 the fact that they dont remember it doesnt bother me
4831653 plaintiffs lawyers will routinely ask for significant damages to try and prompt a settlement
4831654 what possible difference could it make it was all 25 years ago
4831655 i wish him well but i dont talk to reporters
4831656 there has been a lot of misinformation on this issue
4831657 some idea was put out by i dont know who a rumour or some source that the chair leads the discussion that is just not the case my view is im there to ensure that the meeting runs well and fairly and that the vote is taken fairly not to weigh in in favour or against a particular candidate
4831658 i feel reasonably comfortable about the process doing it the way i have outlined that i do it and not getting involved in voting for a particular candidate or advocating for a particular candidate
4831659 i made a personal policy decision that i would not weigh in for or against a particular name and that is the way i have always proceeded
4831660 in fact i do not vote except i reserve the right to vote in the rare case of a tie im told that i voted once to break a tie i dont have a recollection of that my recollection is that i have never voted
4831661 based on the explanation that chief justice mclachlin gave us today what she explained her role as it is not likely to be viewed as judicial misconduct
4831662 as the chief justice said from day one the chief justice has chaired the order of canada
4831663 in light of the role that she has assigned to herself id be surprised if many people would have a problem with the way that she carries out that particular role
4831664 these are historical things that judges have done over the years because of our reputation for indepedence and impartiality
4831665 at some point in time i think that we have to look at those kind of roles as our society changes and people become more aware of the distinct role that the three branches of government had
4831666 the bottom line is if its not about misconduct the complaint is going to be dismissed without asking the judge involved to comment
4831667 i have not said and if i did im going to correct myself that the complaint against chief justice mclachlin is without merit i havent said it is with merit either ive simply said that i dont see a problem in a judge or the chief justice of canada performing the role that she described for us this morning and id be shocked if any other judge in the country had a different opinion
4831668 you have to remember that really the possibility of a conflict between a particular nomination and a future issue that might come before the court is very remote
4831669 and you must also remember that in the judiciary conflicts do occasionally arise we do our best to avoid them ever happening but the fact they happen is something you can deal with if and when they happen

4831713 some of the scholars say it is ok to set this day aside as a means of teaching about our prophet and if done it is not a bidah as sheikh yusuf al qaradawi says
4831714 we all know that the companions of the prophet peace and blessings be upon him did not celebrate the prophets birthday hijrah or the battle of badr because they witnessed such events during the lifetime of the prophet who always remained in their hearts and minds sa d ibn abi waqqas said that they were keen on telling their children the stories of the prophets battles just as they were keen on teaching them the quran therefore they used to remind their children of what happened during the prophets lifetime so they did not need to hold such celebrations however the following generations began to forget such a glorious history and its significance so such celebrations were held as a means of reviving great events and the values that we can learn from them unfortunately such celebrations include some innovations when they should actually be made to remind people of the prophets life and his call actually celebrating the prophets birthday means celebrating the birth of islam such an occasion is meant to remind people of how the prophet lived allah almighty says verily in the messenger of allah ye have a good example for him who looketh unto allah and the last day and remembereth allah much al ahzab 33 21 we need all these lessons and such celebrations are a revival of these lessons and values i think that these celebrations if done in the proper way will serve a great purpose getting muslims closer to the teachings of islam and to the prophets sunnah and life
4831715 celebrating such a great event should be done through reading more about the prophets sunnah and life and if done this way is permissable provided it does not include committing any of the prohibited things

4831726 students who dont cheat seem to be in the minority and have plenty of opportunities to see their peers cheat and receive the rewards with little risk of punishment
4831727 we see avoiding cheating as a form of everyday heroism in an academic setting

4831729 once upon a time before the panicked society wide attempt to expel contingency from american life existence was organized or left sufficiently unorganized for the refreshments of serendipity the domination of the days and the years by logistics had not yet gone from authoritarian to totalitarian interventions of experience and island paradises of idle time still got through there were walks and on those walks finds on a snowy afternoon a few years ago for example i stopped in a record store more evidence of the antiquity of my tale and discovered but first i must introduce a distinction to clarify my complaint it is the distinction between searching and browsing on that lucky day i was not searching i was browsing they are antithetical activities in their pace in their range and in their yield the one is curious and the other is efficient anyway what i found while i was loafing in the record store in dupont circle was the compact disc of one of dizzy gillespies most exquisite records called portrait of jenny from 1970 i had feared that it had not survived the war on vinyl but some fratelli in florence finally made the transfer and my thrill did not end with its acquisition i put the cd on and at the very beginning just as the trumpet first stated its simmering theme i heard a sound that excited me even more i heard a scratch i mean on the record not on the cd and then another scratch and then another and the sounds of the scratches were beautiful to me they were the traces of human use of human ardor they restored me to the liberal age that preceded the frigid perfectionism of the new technologies of reproduction the more you listened to a record and studied it and deployed it as a soundtrack for intimacy or interiority the more scars it bore and they were the scars of true feeling you listened past them the way you listened past the muffled panting of a russian pianist or the clinking of glasses on a far table in birdland i know that cds also get scratched but their flaws have no significance they are only interferences with a silvery promise of pristinity a scratched disc is worthless but a scratched record is a madeleine

4831850 statements from both the bush administration and republican presidential candidate sen john mccain regarding the continuing conflict between russia and georgia indicate once again their shared predisposition to involve americas armed forces in foreign conflicts with no clear link to our countrys vital national security interests
4831851 president george w bush is now sending u s soldiers to georgia under the banner of providing humanitarian assistance placing american forces in an unsettled war zone that clearly risks involving the u s in a confrontation with russia
4831852 the rationale for sen mccains refusal to rule out u s military action in behalf of georgian president saakashvili remains unclear
4831853 whether sen mccains position favoring u s involvement is based on his personal friendship with the georgian leader on a view that u s national interests are somehow immediately and seriously threatened by the conflict between russia and georgia or on some other assessment is unclear but
4831854 it threatens to involve us in a dispute challenging a heavily armed nuclear power in its backyard
4831855 the dispute between russia and georgia has roots going back many centuries and in the current conflict neither side has clean hands
4831856 a similar apparent failure to understand the deep long standing and historic animosities between ethnic and religious groups in iraq led to serious miscalculations in that country we ought to be much more careful about threatening u s military involvement in such situations than current leaders in washington including president bush and sen mccain appear to comprehend
4831857 u s foreign policy should be based on a hard headed assessment of u s interests not warm and fuzzy feelings about a particular foreign leader
4831858 moreover the most important american interest is defending america sen mccain appears to have forgotten that essential principle since intervening on behalf of georgia has nothing to do with defending america
4831859 but are especially so when they involve a major nuclear power generally

4831930 with a sense of pride i can say that our efforts in the past 20 days have paid off and we have almost completely solved the blasts case
4831931 perhaps the centerpiece of mr pringles article was his blatant attempt to unjustifiably discredit the unions selection of service providers based on family involvement for years we have fought to eliminate the practice of unethical nepotism and to this day we question such practices it fascinates me that mr pringle would write this article when we have a us president that facilitated an extremely large sole source contract to a company that is intimately associated with the vice president and this act virtually went unnoticed

4831961 i always did hate the taste of dirt sand is ten times worst then dirt
4831962 what were you aiming for master ben if we defeat a master we gain the title well thats one way to do it another is to be acknowledged as a master from a master
4831963 i was aiming for his left leg what were you aiming for reaper
4831964 his heart master law wouldnt have expected an attack to the heart
4831965 good thing you hit my stomach its callused with the scars of past battles the lightning didnt do much but it did enough to have me stop fighting for now
4831966 congrats cub you are a step closer to being a master yourself but reaper you are an idiot for having him use such a high level spell first what were you thinking
4831967 i was thinking that all the energy wave practice would help well he didnt lose consciousness he just ran out of strength to stand
4831968 master law thank you but i still have no idea what happened how did i mix the mana and my ki together so quickly
4831969 you are so use to using and focusing your ki you must have instinctively absorbed the mana and mixed it without thinking a dangerous thing to do but you were able to mix it and use all the magic created for the spell by the way it appears that your normal aura is green when you absorb mana it changes to purple keep that in mind auras change color when mana is absorbed when you master the aura sight this will be invaluable knowledge
4831970 well it used to be called aura sense but since seeing it can help more people tend to focus on seeing the aura instead of sensing it
4831971 aura sense is how we learned it from our masters
4831972 interesting that you havent mastered it ben smiles what are you smiling about ben
4831973 so you could see my aura so you do have aura sight
4831974 i only saw it after i used that spell i saw a red aura emitting from your body just before i fell to the ground
4831975 guess i have something else to teach you first things first we need to get some bandages on you my juseani spell did some damage to you
4831976 tell me reaper am i able to use a fire spell like artemis
4831977 in your state i would said no but since i have an idea of what you are going to do just mix your ki and some mana and say the word
4831978 what kind of swordsman would have scars on his back those are a disgrace
4831979 the kind that got those before he started swordsmanship i would fight animals when i was younger to protect the village the last animal i fought before becoming a swordsman was master angs ki bear it looked so real and was attacking five girls having their lunch just outside the village i fought it like i normally did lifts right arm this is the scar i got from its bite i wasnt thinking and i bit it back and i also kicked it in the stomach a few times before it disappeared master ang who was watching the village from the forest for a while saw me fight with no weapons each time an animal came near the village after the ki bear vanished he stepped out of the forest and asked me how can i fight a wild animal with no weapons i told him that i wanted to protect my family and village after that he took me under his wing and taught me the bear blade after that i got that silly nickname from the girls
4831980 silly nickname it cant be worst then being called an old bear from a weapon
4831981 maybe to you but to me that name was sort of embarrassing
4831982 they called him the akamarus big teddy bear his fiancee also called him that before she died in fact that shirt he just burnt was the last thing she gave him
4831983 literally letting go of the past thats a step forward just keep this statement in mind young cub those who do not learn from the past are damned to repeat it now come on we need to clean those wounds of yours before they become infected and we need to take you the hospital
4831984 i think we should go and get him a new shirt i saw him burn his old one guess it was beyond repair
4831985 i could say the same for you ben san you should be resting with those wounds
4831986 they been cleaned and wrapped they are okay as long as i dont do anything strenuous
4831987 what are you going to do with that ben san
4831988 i was thinking of throwing it into the ocean i havent come to a conclusion of doing that or not that shirt i burnt today was a gift from maria i never thought i would do something without thinking it through first its not like i can go to maria and ask for a new one because the old one was destroyed in training
4831989 after your training session and while you were being treated i went to the nearest village and got a new shirt for you i know that i couldnt find one like your old one but this one is purple i hope you dont mind
4831990 purple of all the colors that is just coincidence but thank you all the same miss ashley i accept the gift
4831991 no matter how much we want it to change the past is set in stone the future has yet to be written in that stone i dont plan to let the magos write their victory speech on it
4831992 my i wouldnt think you would throw that precious thing away
4831993 im also surprised you burnt your shirt too after i went through that work of placing a transmitter on it as well looks at ashley what the hell i thought i killed her
4831994 so you mastered your ki but thats no match for a good spell benjamin
4831995 if you think i would let you harm my ally without any consequences this time youre dead wrong
4831996 damn this isnt how it was suppose to be why cant you see that women are the down fall of men protecting even one will corrupt your soul bens head pops up did i strike a nerve ben
4831997 you bet our leader hates women and is wanting to get rid of all of them humans dont need such corruption like women they are the cause of all the evil just look at the queen of the past she was obsessed with power and almost conquered the world we are just trying to keep that from happening again
4831998 thank you ben i couldnt move i was so scared that man his presence was immobilizing
4831999 i want you to stay close to me miss ashley
4832000 stay close to me miss ashley i wont let keith harm you if the goal of the magos is to rid the world of women you will be a constant target and since you are traveling with me keith will target you especially
4832001 i like to be inside the scene the best way to escape without leaving home is to paint i can stay on cayman brac and escape into the nature that i love its a way of traveling as sort of mental voyage
4832002 i can go to the lighthouse and look down at the waves crashing and the birds flying while some people prefer to sit down in front of their television sets and watch the discovery channel
4832003 we have places on the island treasures on the bluff that many locals and government officials dont care about such as the splits we see the same frogs amazing sunsets you can hike up to a cave and see it for yourself instead of watching it on tv
4832004 when you go up there you get a whole different feel
4832005 we should look at what we have and preserve what it is and not just look at what you can make out of it the booby birds fly onto the cliff face of the bluff every night why not have that a preserve
4832006 the conclusion from this quick examination of the zanzibar constitution is that zanzibar is a sovereign and a state albeit its sovereignty is limited and the jurisdiction of the executive and the legislature is limited to non union matters in zanzibar while its judiciary as epitomized by the high court has unlimited jurisdiction a mzanzibari owes allegiance to the state of zanzibar and therefore an offence of treason can be committed against the state of zanzibar this is irrespective of the fact that treason may be stipulated as an offence in the union law nevertheless it can be tried in the courts of zanzibar
4832007 application for revision from the ruling of the high court of zanzibar at zanzibar and the decision is titled order of the court perhaps this is an oversight for decisions in applications are normally called rulings
4832008 to call for and exercise the record of any proceedings before the high court
4832009 the sovereign or supreme power in a state or nation
4832010 the machinery by which the sovereign power in a state expresses its will and exercises its functions
4832011 atajulikana kama rais wa zanzibar as the president of zanzibar
4832012 we are of the settled view that subsection 3 applies to proceedings under the consideration or cognisance of the high court in other words proceedings in which the high court is still seized of jurisdiction this construction is underscored by the words to call for similarly emphasized which can only mean calling for a record still before the high court it is known of course that calling for the record may sometimes assume a fictional nature where the record is for some reason already with the court of appeal but legal fictions are not unknown it is common ground that in this case a notice of appeal is already filed t he effect of that notice is to remove the proceedings from the high court into this court an intended appeal has come into existence the proceeding is therefore no longer before the high court and is beyond the ambit os subsection 3

4832088 we are in advanced discussions with several teams for programmes with the backing of various national opel sales offices
4832089 iran should not present on a silver platter the justifications and the pretexts for those who want to drag the region down a dangerous slope

4832091 valid under venezuelas constitution as with any tool of democracy it depends how it is used
4832092 you will be more than guaranteed in the hands of the republic and you know the banking sector of venezuela is one of the most solid in the world
4832093 riot police used tear gas as they blocked hundreds of venezuelans protesting what they call new moves by president chavez to concentrate his power
4832094 blacklists barring key opposition candidates from elections and socialist decrees destroying whats left of their democracy

4832098 conducted strictly on legal and administrative grounds carried out as part of the constitutional and legal obligations of the office of the comptroller general taken following
4832099 is using his decree powers to enact a set of socialist inspired measures that seem based on a package of constitutional changes
4832100 when the government acts as it has now without respecting the constitution and the word of the president is the law then an act of tyranny is being committed
4832101 formalize socialist inspired policies on the margins of the formal economy like a measure declaring barter a legitimate system of payment
4832102 the coming regional elections have the potential to erode the presidents power base
4832103 to set up neighborhood based militias state control over agriculture
4832104 chavez enact ing aggressive new laws with an iron fist increasing the states power over the economy ahead of key regional elections
4832105 drive to create a socialist state significantly increase his power and resemble proposals included in a constitutional reform narrowly rejected by voters in a december referendum
4832106 up in arms over a raft of decree laws they say replicate constitutional reforms
4832107 typical of mr chavezs authoritarian streak and will let him expropriate private property without the need for the ans approval
4832108 ambitious decrees which formalize the creation of a popular militia and further consolidate state control over key areas of the economy such as agriculture and tourism
4832109 bypass ing congress in making laws and being back on the offensive after suffering a humiliating defeat in december that might have let him stay in power for life
4832110 accusations that mr chavez is evading the will of the people
4832111 we are in the presence of a dictatorial government which has given a coup detat to the constitution here we have no constitution no law and the president does exactly what he wants
4832112 everything hes doing is related to the upcoming election and its hard to imagine he doesnt see this as important in his efforts to keep power
4832113 put ting down all challengers to his power forcibly if necessary
4832114 get in the way of mr chavezs caudillo aspirations at your peril
4832115 she looks like keith she has got a little bit of hair it has a bit of a reddish tinge
4832116 my mother was there with me for the birth but my dad hasnt met her and keiths mum and dad are coming down
4832117 mitch and amy are able to work really well together
4832118 although she often gets herself into trouble she is very honest very caring and very perceptive when it comes to dealing with other peoples problems
4832119 she is sick of all her problems being on everyone elses lips and really wants to focus on other people for a change
4832120 and she can help her dad pick some tracks while she is there
4832121 she was absolutely furious when daniel confronted her and they had a full blown argument they were screaming at each other and the next thing she headbutted him
4832122 other family members ran over to break it off and she stormed off it turned from a nice family affair into a brawl between joss and her brother no one could believe it
4832123 you would think as the kids godmother shed be on time
4832124 as she recited the order of service she failed to read what she had been given it showed a lack of respect
4832125 the priest had to remind her of her responsibilities as a godparent it was embarrassing to see her mumble the wrong words
4832126 a couple of relatives were not happy and told her so afterwards but joss said she wouldnt take abuse of a bunch of old biddies
4832127 joss had been looking forward to the baptism no one seemed bothered she was a little late but a few people from daniels side said something
4832128 eu gosto muito dessa nova gera o de m sicos menos cabe a dura do que a minha
4832129 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude and i want america to know im like totally ready to lead
4832130 ill have to sacrifice my play time to do some study so i can pass this exam
4832131 two train rails one very old and not in use while other is still in service a bunch of naughty kids playing on the rail in service while one good child plays on the old one theyre both unaware of a train coming you have your hands on the rail lever and a choice to make pull it the train will go to the old track and kill the one good child or do nothing and many naughty kids will die
4832132 were living in a harsh land and theres alot of stress in our lives besides its everyones dream to fuck a beautiful little girl once in his life
4832133 were all in it and it doesnt make sense to send the majority of the people into jail
4832134 if its for the sake of the majority its right
4832135 whatever symbol used as a sacrifice for the people to set their blame so they can escape the guilt and responsibility
4832136 but dude this is about saving lives and the matter with human lives are different
4832137 estamos en un mundo en donde en vez de tratar de contener a un tipo que es realmente grande estas tratando de contener a un tipo que puede en el caso de icicle congelar cosas
4832138 lo veo como el jason bourne de los superh roes
4832139 ciertamente tiene el f sico y actitud para el jugoso rol considerando lo cabr n que damon fue en la ltima pel cula de bourne
4832140 its so hard to describe you see a chopper and you cant get help in anyway
4832141 the snow conditions were just crazy it was so soft it was at chest height
4832142 were a little bit disappointed they didnt have the minimum of winter equipment thats avalanche beacon shovel and probe
4832143 i guess it hit me then that we could be stuck up there
4832144 there is no credible evidence that a single elective abortion of an unwanted pregnancy in and of itself causes mental health problems for adult women
4832145 to protect the fundamental freedoms and rights essential to the preservation of american society
4832146 women obtain abortions for different reasons at different times of gestation via differing medical procedures and within different personal social economic and cultural contexts all of these may lead to variability in womens psychological reactions following abortion
4832147 consequently global statements about the psychological impact of abortion on women can be misleading
4832148 no evidence sufficient to support the claim that an observed association between abortion history and mental health was caused by the abortion per se as opposed to other factors
4832149 help disentangle confounding factors and establish relative risks of abortion compared to its alternatives
4832150 i would agree that more research needs to be done because psychiatrists are not asking women with mental issues if they have had abortions
4832151 right now the abortion recovery movement is somewhat of a self help movement
4832152 psychological associations are denying the pain rather than asking women about it and theyre denying it i believe for ideological reasons
4832153 a lot of risk factors for having an abortion and subsequent problems which abortionists do not currently reveal to the women
4832154 this raises a new standard of abortion malpractice in america because even the apa admits that if you have risk factors like prior sexual abuse or low self esteem you are at risk for abortion related trauma
4832155 by the apas own admission then almost all abortionists in america are committing malpractice because they do not check for those factors before performing the abortion
4832156 there may be conflicting studies but its a lie to say there are no studies which show harm from abortion
4832157 some were perfectly happy straight a students with no history of family trauma
4832158 then they had the abortion and began a destructive cycle
4832159 i was a straight a college student and had an abortion during junior year of college
4832160 they said you never have to tell anyone so i never told about my abortion
4832161 even when i went to the doctor i never admitted i was pregnant or had had an abortion
4832162 they couldnt understand why i had the breakdown they gave me medication but it wasnt doing anything
4832163 one thing i didnt understand is that it was actually a human being
4832164 i was told it was just a lump of tissue one of the things that opened my eyes was seeing pictures of fetal development
4832165 i thought i was the only woman when i first started dealing with my abortion experience
4832166 now ive come to find out that there are many women that have the same grief depression and loss issues
4832167 in the past we thought if a marine had post traumatic stress disorder he was gone now its more like breaking a leg
4832168 the good news is that while we started out not thinking too much about ptsd now we are thinking about a lot
4832169 some marines have bad habits and turn to alcohol others turn to drugs its definitely on the rise
4832170 we need them badly the fighting is not going to end anytime soon and we need to take care of our marines
4832171 i dont think this is the silver bullet but it will get some people to step up for help and that is what we need
4832172 we prepare for war why not prepare for the consequences of the war
4832173 finally on the right track before they wouldnt even recognize that there was a problem
4832174 for the vast majority of marine warriors these are anticipated brief responses to combat and operational stress
4832175 it is the leaders responsibility for making sure marines get help
4832176 its our job to restore marines to the extent we can by reducing the stigma
4832177 we have to encourage people to talk about their problems
4832178 todays terrain was very different from yesterdays but the conditions stayed dry again we got off to a good start and my c4 wrc was handling just as nicely as it did on friday thanks to the work of everyone in the team we also got the mornings two tyre calls spot on namely pirelli softs for the three stages up to the remote service zone then hards for the harder wearing tank testing tracks the result was excellent we have pulled even further clear of our main rival in the world championship and dani and marc are holding second place so thats all very positive we just had one scary moment this morning when we brushed a hay bail that formed part of a chicane in one particularly fast portion it wasnt in the same position as it was during recce
4832179 the new south is everywhere but you can also find the old south physically depending on how far you get off the interstate and the old south whatever that is still exists in some form or another for better or worse in the psyche of more than one human being
4832180 it was short but showed nothing that is illegal to show personally ive seen worse on easterns campus than what this young lady was wearing
4832181 but they can see girls naked on the beaches at home
4832182 why do you people feel so strange about your bodies
4832183 secretary of state condoleezza rice launched emergency talks in france aimed at heading off a wider conflict
4832184 the message is that russia has perhaps not accepted that it is time to move on from the cold war and it is time to move to a new era in which relations between states are on the basis of equality and sovereignty and economic integration
4832185 a new era in which relations between states are on the basis of equality and sovereignty and economic integration
4832186 je neuspe en krst sicer na mednarodnem prizorii u na ljubljanski klopi v celju za
4832187 je pred sre anjem v slovenski prestolnici dejal strateg najbogatej ega slovenskega prvoliga a pred katerim je sicer sila te ka naloga
4832188 our goal is not to be on a witch hunt to close programs
4832189 but they need to be operating on a minimum level
4832190 were bigger and closer to other agencies that can help
4832191 like diabetes or high blood pressure mental illness can be treated
4832192 similar to high blood pressure many of the mood disorders are inherited illnesses and people do not need to live with them
4832193 if they want therapy they get it they cannot get it if it is court ordered
4832194 what we need to consider as responsible adults is that things that occur in pop culture movies television and books are things that people do use in some sort of laymans way to educate themselves or to learn from or emulate in their own lives
4832195 these things are repeated by young people and adults alike
4832196 we also try to talk about the person not their diagnosis
4832197 thats still a clinical term thats used when someone is given a diagnosis
4832198 what that means is that a person has an iq of 70 or below and some adaptive functioning limitations as far as carrying on their day to day living
4832199 i think anyone who works in that line of work would share the same opinion that people with a disability are not deserving of any particular label thats derogatory
4832200 theyre proud of the work they do out there and theyre proud of the products they make
4832201 these are people like you and i they have challenges but they are still human beings and still deserve to have dignity in their lives
4832202 many organizations have worked very hard for many years now to inform people that those with development disabilities are first of all people who deserve respect
4832203 hes a taxpaying citizen which i think some people forget they are able to work and sometimes require special circumstances but he has worked at goodwill for 15 or more years and they say he does an excellent job
4832204 one of the banned words we were never allowed to say in our home was retarded
4832205 weve not seen this movie so it would be inappropriate to comment on something we havent viewed
4832206 de s krar omr det f r att skydda sig mot georgiska anfall
4832207 and i dont think anyone would have beaten him with a run like that today
4832208 i told you all i was going to be no 1
4832209 he was definitely untouchable tonight he could have gone a lot faster if he had run straight through the line
4832210 anything is possible the human body is changing so you never know
4832211 i aim just to win but when i saw the replay i was amazed
4832212 you could hear them screaming but there was nothing you could do
4832213 in the same area on the first floor at the rear
4832214 but the bodies did appear to have some severe burns
4832215 i gave it my best theres definitely no regrets to walk away with a silver im pretty happy
4832216 i was picturing the new zealand flag in the middle to be honest and i was picturing that gold medal round my neck its coming i tell ya
4832217 im not saying the doctors were wrong but im not saying they were right
4832218 to do what ive done is something i can be proud of
4832219 it hasnt been easy theres been many ups and downs
4832220 i came in here with expectations of riding a personal best
4832221 it feels so great to have exceeded expectations and to be riding for a medal
4832222 i just have to go back home and reflect on what went wrong really i was so confident i had the form of my life
4832223 i just have to get my chin up and come out fighting again in two days
4832224 you can support us or leave to our fate but if they come for us and all hope is gone we will turn the middle east into a radioactive wasteland until the end of time
4832225 let us now mourn and fix our homes this is more than any of us can take but together we are this village and there is nothing that can stop us
4832226 rise all ye people rise from the dead learn not to follow not to be led get up rise up greet the day break the bread find a way get up rise up fires may burn and torture an pillage but well be damned if it will take our village rise rise rise
4832227 why do you bother if fire destroys so much here move
4832228 its our home sonny a place where we have lived and died and lived some more sure fire ravages us every year and troubles always come here but we live here and love here we will never leave we will persevere
4832229 there will be so many problems can we take it
4832230 we are meeting in secret with a congressional committee if these meetings were public it would prove
4832231 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity
4832232 as the commission finds are necessary to diminish eliminate or prevent such burden
4832233 we did not understand the deep emotions of so many of our customers for coca cola
4832234 someone believed the edsel or the eight track tape or rcas videodisc was going to work and they staked their careers and reputations on it and kept pushing it in spite of misgivings
4832235 or maybe the research was beginning to suggest this wasnt a good idea or they didnt do their research
4832236 when youre convinced youre right you tend to push on regardless
4832237 if its a bad idea it doesnt take long for the verdict to be reached
4832238 the democratic party has not had a candidate for statewide office to energize african american voters since bill clinton left the state
4832239 whether they like it or not theyre going to be tied to obama they might as well get the benefits out of it
4832240 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives

4832246 a new cnn poll just came out about the campaign interesting results a new study shows that wine drinkers prefer hillary clinton to the other candidates yeah after hearing this bill clinton asked how much wine have they had i guess this is good news former new york governor eliot spitzer has reportedly entered therapy for a sex addiction spitzer said his therapy is going well and that his therapist has a fantastic rack in new jersey today there were dangerous winds with gusts up to 50 miles an hour the winds were so strong that they blew former governor mcgreevey off his chauffeur well of course this sunday is easter of course easter is that very very holy day when christians around the world honor a 2 000 year old jewish man who is not larry king a big insurance company just announced they will give 10 million to anyone who can invent a car that gets 100 miles per gallon meanwhile exxon says theyll give 11 million to anyone who kills that guy
4832247 when people in this worn looking city near pittsburgh lament how the sagging economy is slowly crushing them some are also quick to add how much hillary clinton could help them
4832248 with that in mind i believe that the best candidate for philadelphia is the one who has not only ideas but the skills to implement them is willing to embrace change while also working in collaboration with us at the local level is experienced and willing to extend a helping hand and possesses both good judgment and a profound sense of social justice based on those criteria ive made my decision on which candidate i support i have endorsed senator hillary clinton hillary clinton has an impressive 35 year record of fighting on behalf of working families and children fighting for universal health care for every american and has a comprehensive plan to end the war in iraq and restore our standing around the world but most importantly she has a strong commitment to revitalizing our urban centers and i believe that under her leadership our american cities will rise again the hillary clinton agenda for revitalizing philadelphia and other major metropolitan areas is called leave no city behind and it creates a vital partnership between our efforts here in philadelphia and the efforts of the federal government
4832249 pledging to work her heart out if elected president democratic candidate u
4832250 we need to send someone who can be commander in chief and president
4832251 hillary clinton evoked themes of sisterhood and motherhood while addressing women voters in blue bell today and reminded them shed be a strong commander in chief and a fighter for universal health care
4832252 we have seen changes that are unimaginable for our mothers and grandmothers
4832253 there were colleges i couldnt go to scholarships i couldnt apply for

4832260 they have lovely facilities here and my husband ian and i just thought it would be nice to get hannah signed up
4832261 some people may say shes too young but the books are specially designed with simple black and white shapes for youngsters
4832262 we signed her brother alex up when he was 10 days old and we thought he might be the youngest member then but this beats even that
4832263 we were shocked when they came in wanting to sign up their two day old daughter
4832264 the father said he had grown up with books and felt it was important for children to read and its true
4832265 although little hannah wont be able to read just yet she will be able to make out basic shapes and pictures and our stock has a lot of baby books

4832267 the difference between success and failure for many organizations hinges on one word the power of teamwork is a simple truths classic that was written by blue angel pilot scott beare and michael mcmillan it truly captures the essence of the nine key principles of teamwork that are used by the ultimate team the blue angels also each principle ties back to what it means to your company and your team heres an excerpt from one of the chapters titled capitalize on synergy i found it fascinating and think you will too enjoy

4832270 i dont think you can control all the world from one centre
4832271 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
4832272 there are so many important issues like the nuclear issue iraq the caucasus afghanistan
4832273 iran is definitely having some influence of these issues so we are talking
4832274 we dont want to see weapons of mass destruction in this region
4832275 if its in our neighbourhood we definitely dont want to see it
4832276 i dont want to think about that everybody should take a lesson from what happened in iraq
4832277 i wish to see turkey as an island where the european standard of democracy is being fulfilled and the free market economy is functioning very well
4832278 this will be a real gift to the region to the world for peace and this turkey will be a source of inspiration for so many
4832279 as we are transforming ourselves in that direction we will not forget our natural links and relationships and advantages with other countries muslim countries central asian countries caucasus countries middle eastern and other countries
4832280 turkey is having a positive impact on them spreading the values of democracy freedom rule of law also the economic changes here are admired maybe that is the indirect influence of this country
4832281 in the last two years we spent our energy on domestic issues and the reforms slowed down
4832282 now after the court case there is a new era this is a big opportunity for turkey everybody realises that reforms are necessary
4832283 turkey has great capacity to influence the region indirectly very peacefully being an inspiration for changes turkey has been playing this role already this has not been appreciated enough
4832284 europe should realise that turkey can do more for the stability and security of the region
4832285 start with the caucasus last month the problem was not serious but suddenly we found ourselves in a war situation
4832286 europe should encourage turkey and not create some artificial problems during the negotiation process with us some member countries or some politicians should not mix domestic issues and strategic issues domestic issues are conjunctural today its there and tomorrow its not but the strategic issues are always there and we cannot sacrifice strategic issues for domestic issues unfortunately nowadays we see this kind of shortsighted policies in some countries
4832287 some call it terror some call it the south east problem some call it the kurdish problem whatever you call it we will find a solution
4832288 there are other problems secularism and anti secularism those things will also find solutions in this climate that is why i focus on the reform process the problem was this the lack of democracy the standard of democracy that was creating problems not only in the south east but in other issues that is when we upgrade the standards these problems will find solutions
4832289 but having a good relationship helps the stability of the region

4832307 its certainly good to have attention drawn to the issues of the libertarian party

4832311 this is his glory his time to shine and i want him to get everything he wants
4832312 was it the lowest point in my career ive had a few like that but its got to be up there definitely
4832313 to be fair we were doing all right until half time we kept them out and created some chances at the other end as well but then for some reason the roof fell in
4832314 you just have to try and focus on your own job and try and stop the goals coming in thats all you can do but we cant have a repeat of that
4832315 we hope things are going to be better this time but i cant sit here and say they definitely will be
4832316 i do feel that we need to strengthen the squad a bit
4832317 injuries and suspensions could hit us a lot harder than manchester united who can put out two full international teams we dont have enough quality in depth

4832319 we will meet with the representatives of chevron texaco who are asking for a meeting but with our colleagues of the amazon defense front the plaintiffs lawyers present
4832320 be confident that you have a patriotic and sovereign government that will never again bow to the interests of the big transnational companies
4832321 i couldnt have been asked to shoot against a better shooter
4832322 i hoped he wouldnt miss because tore and me are really good friends but i could feel the nervousness building inside me so i was hoping it wouldnt last much longer
4832323 the game plan was to hit every shot if you are perfect nobody can beat you
4832324 we will meet with the representatives of chevron texacowho are asking for a meeting but with our colleagues of theamazon defense front the plaintiffs lawyers present
4832325 be confident that you have a patriotic and sovereigngovernment that will never again bow to the interests of thebig transnational companies

4832330 c mo se asegurar el juzgamiento de los m ximos responsables de cr menes que estar an bajo la competencia de la cpi incluyendo a dirigentes pol ticos y miembros del congreso presuntamente vinculados con los grupos desmovilizados
4832331 en particular me gustar a saber si las investigaciones seguidas hasta la fecha indican la comisi n de conductas penadas por el estatuto de roma y si la extradici n de los l deres paramilitares presenta alg n obst culo en la eficaz investigaci n de los mencionados pol ticos
4832332 no se ha tomado ninguna decisi n con relaci n a la apertura de una investigaci n
4832333 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4832334 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4832335 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4832336 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4832337 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4832338 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4832339 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4832340 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4832341 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4832342 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4832343 which is the best software to recover a disk hard disk
4832344 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4832345 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4832346 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4832347 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4832348 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4832349 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

4832353 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4832354 my ups is not functionaing properly it is not giving any back up and my computer gets off as soon as the power fails
4832355 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4832356 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4832357 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4832358 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4832359 nobody is going to brag at my funeral about the awesome conservative decisions i made
4832360 right now were trying to make some hard decisions at the cornerback position to try to find out who the starters are going to be
4832361 i think kendric burney has probably solidified himself hes played very very good all the rest of them are basically unknown commodities jordan hemby has never really ever played in a game johnny white and richie rich are new to the position theyre battling to compete at the position
4832362 another guy we havent talked a whole heckuva lot about this fall has been tavorris jolly tavorris is one of those players that maybe the light has come on sometimes guys kind of languish in a little bit of ambiguity early in their career not knowing exactly how to compete and what to do and what does it take to win so hes had a nice camp hes put himself silently in that mix of could he be somebody we could count on right now were still a ways from naming starters
4832363 if theres been one really bright spot with our corners in the struggle to try to figure out who the starters are going to be they have tackled very well
4832364 maybe at least two of the fumbles that were forced were caused by the secondary tackling and gang tackling
4832365 you want to see how your second team players would have to play
4832366 if they go into a ball game as a replacement for a starter they have to play against somebody elses best players
4832367 we took bryon bishop and alan pelc and kind of split the reps with the first and the second unit with both of those guys to see how they play
4832368 i love the competition i love the fact that they both want to be the guy
4832369 by his own request draughn requested to be given an opportunity to go to running back
4832370 as a new coaching staff we didnt have the privilege of seeing him in high school and watching him actually play running back hed been a defensive back for a couple of years but his heart and his passion was to be a running back hes done a very very good job hes learned the offense for the most part he can go in and execute the runs the passes and the protections hes exciting
4832371 thats whats great about this regatta nobody expects us to win a medal but were not here as tourists
4832372 it feels great im probably in the best sailing shape ive been in for 30 years
4832373 it was the thrill of a lifetime i mean standing there in a tunnel people chanting usa the adrenalin pumping it was just a moment to remember my whole life
4832374 theyre all super sailors at least 12 of them could win the gold medal i mean they are that tough
4832375 est en la l nea del inter s nuestro del gobierno que haya un actor p blico en la industria de las administradoras de fondos de pensiones es un compromiso que el gobierno tiene
4832376 he comprometido con los senadores ver con mucho inter s y detenci n su propuesta que seg n lo que han se alado ellos habr a votos para esta iniciativa y eso claro como yo siempre he dicho los proyectos tiene que cumplir dos requisitos esenciales ser buenos en su m rito y ser viables as que tenemos este mes para hacerlo y esperamos a fin de mes estar ingresando el proyecto que corresponda
4832377 la reforma constitucional presentada por los senadores tiene los mismos fundamentos de la moci n que ellos me presentaron y que declarada inadmisible as que me merece la misma opini n hay que verla con inter s y yo creo que finalmente los senadores intentan generar una cierta presi n para que opere un compromiso del gobierno yo creo que es una reiteraci n en el mismo sentido de lo que ya conocemos vamos a verlo todav a tenemos este mes

4832394 la verdad es que no qued contento con la experiencia de publicar mi primer libro en busca de un amor imposible 2004 a trav s de una editorial ya que no tuvo una buena distribuci n y los costos fueron elevados adem s me d cuenta que estas empresas tienen muchas restricciones sobre todo si se trata de un autor desconocido

4832406 our experience in outfitting tour players for the pga championship is that it presents some of the most challenging conditions our athletes face all year its peak summer weather with a grueling combination of heat and humidity
4832407 with this in mind we scripted our athletes with the goal of ensuring that their apparel would perform under these tough conditions and provide them with a competitive advantage over the course of the weekend the performance of their apparel should not be on their minds the week of the tournament instead they should be confident that what they are wearing is going to keep them dry cool and as comfortable as possible
4832408 we know that canadians love being outdoors all year and especially in our short summer season many canadians also love being on the golf course weathereye golf is part of an evolution for our desktop widgets and downloads and our continuing efforts to bring critical weather information to canadians wherever they may be
4832409 we recognized the weather network as a leader in canada providing both weather information and widget applications we see the weathereye golf as a natural fit for our brand to help educate the consumer on our vast line of equipment and apparel for all weather conditions in canada

4832422 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4832423 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

4832428 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4832429 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4832430 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4832431 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4832432 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

4832442 ahora rusia necesita hacer honor a este acuerdo retirar sus fuerzas de georgia y por supuesto poner fin a sus operaciones militares
4832443 el tema principal es que la lucha de rusia por las regiones de osetia y abjasia no debe formar parte del futuro de georgia estas regiones son parte de georgia y la comunidad internacional ha repetido hasta la saciedad que seguir n si ndolo
4832444 estas resoluciones est n basadas en la premisa de que osetia del sur y abjasia permanecen dentro de las fronteras de georgia y que cualquier conflicto internacional sobre este tema se debe resolver mediante negociaciones internacionales

4832452 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4832453 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4832454 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4832455 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4832456 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4832457 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4832458 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4832459 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4832460 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4832461 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4832462 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4832463 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4832464 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4832465 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4832466 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4832467 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4832468 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4832469 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4832470 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4832471 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4832472 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4832473 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4832474 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4832475 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4832476 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4832477 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4832478 no one will look for such fossils if the creatures involved are not thought to exist in the first place but even with recognized primates fossil finds are usually meager at best
4832479 i have yet to meet anyone who has found the remains of a bear that was not killed by human activity

4832482 were not off the notion of a justice league theres a massive interest and knowledge in the comicbook industry and it takes time to sort of catch up and understand the characters and the history where theyve intersected with each other and what their worlds are thats part of the education that were going through
4832483 these are big iconic characters so when you make them into a movie youd better be shooting for a pretty high standard youre not always going to reach it but you have to be shooting for it were going to make a justice league movie whether its now or 10 years from now but were not going to do it and warners is not going to do it until we know its right
4832484 soon youll be in the real world better wear a hat
4832485 j me sinto entrosado com o gladstone mas n o completamente depois dessa seq ncia de dois jogos por semana vamos ter mais tempo para trabalhar e com um treinador como o que n s temos vai fazer a diferen a

4832487 estava com uma dor muito forte no joelho precisava de uma semana para fazer um tratamento intensivo
4832488 n o estamos desesperados desespero quando n o se tem rumo o que n o o nosso caso a necessidade de resultado imperiosa claro estamos apressando o processo de entrosamento da equipe queremos no aproximar do g 4 o mais breve poss vel
4832489 normal que o torcedor vaie quando o time n o obt m os resultados mas antes do jogo contra o santos olhei para l local onde fica a arquibancada popular no beira rio e ouvi o pessoal gritando meu nome me senti gratificado vamos retomar a boa campanha estou certo disso
4832490 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4832491 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4832492 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4832493 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4832494 i know that there are some really good human beings who will be soon looking for work and i sincerely hope that none of them stop chasing their dreams
4832495 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4832496 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4832497 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4832498 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4832499 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4832500 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4832501 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4832502 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4832503 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4832504 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4832505 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4832506 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4832507 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4832508 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4832509 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4832510 weve been ahead at burnley before and been pegged back it was important we made ourselves difficult to beat and that is something we have to do for another 22 away games

4832540 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4832541 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4832542 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4832564 we always looked in control and i always thought the second goal would come
4832565 but west brom defended very well and we lacked a bit of sharpness around the box credit to west brom
4832566 if the second does not come you can be punished in the last 10 minutes but samir nasri had a good game and we are happy with the three points
4832567 you get my work and do whatever you want to do if i agreed to give you the rights its because i like your point of view and your movies and i completely trust you

4832572 es una lecci n para saber lo que tenemos que hacer
4832573 no estoy feliz ellos han jugado con mucha m s intensidad y no hemos sido capaces de jugar con la misma intensidad veintiocho robos de bal n es un n mero con el que no puedes tener posibilidad de ganar

4832582 hemos perdido y hemos perdido muy claramente tenemos que intentar recuperarnos de este partido para el pr ximo contra angola y llegar a los cuartos de final con el equipo con m s moral de que la que hemos tenido
4832583 es bueno ganar contundentemente a los rivales m s duros eso es una buena actitud de equipo
4832584 al principio no hemos sido todo lo agresivos que podemos y entonces pues coincide un poco con la diferencia de cuando estamos jugando los partidos de preparaci n y cuando estamos jugando los partidos de los juegos ol mpicos a pesar de que llevemos tres victorias y una derrota
4832585 una de las causas es porque la presi n de los juegos ol mpicos influye lo suyo y no hemos jugado con la misma frescura que hemos jugado previamente independientemente de las victorias y las derrotas
4832586 lo primero que hay que hacer para animarse es reconocer la realidad y la realidad es que el equipo americano nos ha arrasado y cuando se pierden 28 balones creo que est todo dicho y entonces lo que hay que hacer es aparte de reconocer esa realidad intentar hacer lo que puedes independientemente de la victoria o la derrota que puedas tener
4832587 es la parte m s importante unido a su porcentaje de triples que no coincide con lo que hab an hecho hasta ahora pero la causa est en que nos hacen una presi n como la que a nosotros nos gustar a hacer en la mayor a de las ocasiones
4832588 derrotados de antemano no pero s con menos frescura que en los partidos de preparaci n que hemos jugado cuando te est n robando tantos balones y metiendo tantas canastas pues te vienes un poco abajo
4832589 no creo que lo importante ahora sea decir si la distancia es m s o menos
4832590 es muy dif cil jugar en unos juegos ol mpicos contra equipos como grecia alemania china en su casa es muy dif cil como los estados unidos tambi n es muy dif cil jugar en la selecci n cuando la responsabilidad queda m s repartida y es dif cil asumir estas circunstancias y asumirlas bien
4832591 tenemos que hacer un resumen parcial del campeonato en el que ha habido tres xitos de los que tenemos que estar orgullosos porque significa ser segundos de grupo pero l gicamente no podemos estar muy contentos con el partido de hoy hay que reconocer que los americanos lo han hecho con un potencial tremendo y hay que ver c mo somos capaces de ir mejorando estos detalles para tener mas opciones en los cuartos
4832592 pinta croacia pero no hay que correr con el pensamiento vamos a esperar el partido con angola y el del otro grupo
4832593 el partido de angola supone una preparaci n para el partido de cuartos porque una cosa que hab amos hablado antes del encuentro de hoy es que al margen de ganar o de perder ten amos que estar frescos para los cuartos
4832594 para eso para estar frescos queremos que el ltimo partido nos d una sensaciones mejores que las de hoy y eso nos va ayudar a mantener una buena disposici n para el partido de cuartos
4832595 la diferencia entre jugar contra el tercer o el cuarto clasificado no creo que sea muy grande lo que hace falta es que estemos mentalmente bien
4832596 si ellos juegan con la intensidad y el acierto de hoy es muy dif cil que lo pueda hacer cualquiera ganarles pero es posible que no jueguen con la misma intensidad y el mismo acierto
4832597 le dio pase exquisito a ngel di mar a quien defini cruzado y le dio clasificaci n
4832598 el crack del barcelona espa ol hab a abierto el marcador con un golazo
4832599 de todos modos el equipo del t cnico sergio batista cont con las mejores ocasiones y siempre asumi el rol de protagonista las apariciones de messi fueron clave para sacar adelante un encuentro que cada vez parec a m s duro
4832600 como en los partidos anteriores abr a la puerta para que el rival so ara con algo m s
4832601 royston drenthe muy solo tir por arriba del larguero argentino a cuatro minutos del final
4832602 el cl sico rival tambi n llega a las semifinales ol mpicas con algunos problemas como argentina necesit el alargue para sacarse de encima a camer n 2 0
4832603 parece una final anticipada porque la otra semifinal ser b lgica nigeria
4832604 esto te duele pero nos tiene que servir para ser m s fuertes
4832605 han sido superiores hay que reconocerlo no hay ninguna excusa hemos perdido un mont n de balones
4832606 quiz s nos hemos venido abajo un poco pronto tenemos que mirar hacia adelante queda mucho estamos enfrente de una gran oportunidad de poder estar en semifinales e intentaremos mejorar el pr ximo partido
4832607 hemos hablado del tema de que no pasa nada y a n queda mucho recorrido no podemos hacer otra cosa
4832608 hay diferencia pero no tanta no hemos salido c mo ten amos que salir y nos hemos venido un poco abajo
4832609 no ten an buenos porcentajes de triples y han metido una barbaridad nuestro cambio de defensa tampoco ha salido bien han estado superiores en todos los sentidos
4832610 ojal podamos jugar otro partido y seguro que si jugamos otro partido contra ellos no ser de esta manera
4832611 no nos hemos escondido nada hemos tratado de salir a jugar de t a t pero la verdad es que no hemos podido
4832612 es un honor jugar contra un gran equipo y espa a tiene un gran equipo
4832613 los partido mas importante los jugaremos la semana que viene
4832614 la defensa y los robos de balones ha sido de lo que estamos m s satisfechos tenemos ocho jugadores en dobles figuras

4832948 councils are increasingly having to consider taking action where parents are putting childrens health in real danger
4832949 as the obesity epidemic grows these tricky cases will keep on cropping up councils would step in to deal with an undernourished and neglected child so should a case with a morbidly obese child be different if parents consistently place their children at risk through bad diet and lack of exercise is it right that a council should step in to keep the childs health under review
4832950 the nations expanding waistline threatens to have a devastating impact on our public services its a huge issue for public health but it also risks placing an unprecedented amount of pressure on council services
4832951 but in the worst cases the children would need to be put on at risk registers or taken into care
4832952 even then the care proceedings may well have been instigated because of related problems rather than exclusively because of their weight

4832982 and i saw a great and wondrous sign in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars and she being with child cries travailing in birth and pained to be delivered and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born and she brought forth a man child who is to rule all the nations and the child was caught up unto god and to his throne and the woman fled into the wilderness where she hath the place prepared of god that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days and then when the dragon saw it he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child and to the woman were given two wings of the great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood and the earth helped the woman and opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth and the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the saints of her seed which keep the commandments of god and have the testimony of jesus

4833009 the place that has suffered most is south ossetia which is home to both ethnic ossetians and georgians the latter accounting for about a third of the population
4833010 ossetians fleeing the conflict zone talk of georgian atrocities and the indiscriminate killing of civilians
4833011 on august 7 after days of shooting incidents in the south ossetian conflict zone georgian president mikheil saakashvili made a speech in which he said that he had given the georgian villagers orders not to fire that he wanted to offer south ossetia unlimited autonomy within the georgian state with russia to be a guarantor of the arrangement
4833012 both sides said they were discussing a meeting the next day to discuss how to defuse the clashes
4833013 that evening however saakashvili went for the military option the georgian military launched a massive artillery attack on tskhinvali followed the next day by a ground assault involving tanks
4833014 this was a city with no pure military targets full of civilians who had been given no warning and were expecting peace talks at any moment
4833015 the attack looked designed to take everybody by surprise perhaps because much of the russian leadership was in beijing for the opening of the olympic games it also unilaterally destroyed the negotiating and peacekeeping arrangements under the aegis of the organization for security and cooperation in europe that have been in place for 16 years russian peacekeeping troops based in south ossetia were among those killed in the georgian assault
4833016 many had traveled in their nightclothes on rocky roads through the mountains and gave bloodcurdling accounts of georgian atrocities i came in the boot of a car georgian snipers were firing at us from the forest my brother stayed to fight our grandparents home was reduced to rubble we dont know where they are nothing is left of their village it was totally destroyed by rockets and tank fire alisa mamiyeva 26 a teacher in tskhinvali said from the safety of vladikavkaz in north ossetia
4833017 russia failed to back up its claims of georgian atrocities
4833018 coverage in the u s and europe is leaning heavily toward reports on the georgian casualties of russian bombing over the weekend few details are being given about the thousands said to have been killed when georgia attacked tskhinvali the capital of south ossetia on thursday and friday
4833019 the figure of 2 000 people killed is very doubtful our findings so far do not in any way confirm the russian statistics on the contrary they suggest the numbers are exaggerated
4833020 one woman told how a family of four including two children tried to flee from a georgian tank but it fired on their car and they were all burned to death said angela who like all the refugees only gave her first name
4833021 she saw the georgian tanks roll into tskhinvali the soldiers shouting hail saakashvili who is the president of georgia they destroyed the city added inna 33 who said she could not understand how the georgian troops could do that to civilians
4833022 you see your friends home burning and theres nothing you can do you just watch and cry its a genocide inna said an old woman among the refugees said all she had left was the dress she was wearing my house is destroyed she said

4833037 the governor is satisfied with current law in that abstinence is the only 100 percent effective way to prevent pregnancy
4833038 its important to make a distinction between pregnancy rate and birth rate texas does not have the highest teen pregnancy rate
4833039 our public health facilities and public schools can help reduce teenage pregnancies by educating young people about the consequences of premarital sex and promoting abstinence
4833040 the problem with moving away from the abstinence curriculum is the notion that premarital sex is state condoned

4833093 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4833094 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

4833098 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4833099 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4833100 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4833101 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4833102 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording

4833105 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground

4833108 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays

4833110 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway

4833112 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education

4833114 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4833115 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4833116 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4833117 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4833118 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4833119 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds

4833348 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4833349 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4833350 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4833351 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4833352 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4833353 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4833354 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4833355 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4833356 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that

4833367 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4833368 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4833377 a strange coincidence around the murder of paul johnson is that the saudi police apparently cooperated with those who abducted him why would a security service trained by american and british c i a fronts like the vinnell corp cooperate with al qaeda their purported enemy this is the second time during the last weeks that saudi security forces have cooperated with al qaeda if this starts happening regularly it would suggest either a very grave instability in the kingdom or that the saudi security forces are run in accordance with american interests

4833379 on behalf of my people i would like to say that we deny that the terror practices of al qaeda represent islam and moslems in any way we are against the instrumentalization of islam and all moslems by the cia through their front organization al qaeda this disgusting criminal gang has already caused too much death and suffering for innocents of all creeds in many lands we reject the al qaeda announcement to killing innocent people under the name of islam for revenge of the injustices comitted against palestinians we reject all al qaeda practices as these crimes are against humanity these crimes are all steered from washington by the cia and they only represent u s policy
4833380 the al qaeda terror organization has caused immense damage to islam to moslems worldwide and to the interests of the peoples of all arab and muslim countries
4833381 in fact the cia is using the terrorist actions of its proxy al qaeda in order to give the u

4833384 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4833385 it was immediately apparent that the move to summer 2009 offered us the potential to reach the widest possible audience i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of

4833396 for when gentiles who do not have the law do instinctively the things of the law these not having the law are a law to themselves 15 in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them 16 on the day when according to my gospel god will judge the secrets of men through christ jesus
4833397 for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days says the lord i will put my laws into their minds and i will write them on their hearts and i will be their god and they shall be my people 1 1 and they shall not teach everyone his fellow citizen and everyone his brother saying know the lord for all will know me from the least to the greatest of them 12 for i will be merciful to their iniquities and i will remember their sins no more
4833398 for if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh
4833399 he who believes in him is not judged he who does not believe has been judged already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god 19 this is the judgment that the light has come into the world and men loved the darkness rather than the light for their deeds were evil
4833400 therefore brethren since we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of jesus

4833403 i know the sun he has a way of making you feel alive but dont be misled it doesnt matter how you feel youll get burnt
4833404 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4833405 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4833406 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4833407 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4833408 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4833409 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4833410 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4833411 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4833412 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4833413 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4833414 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4833415 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4833416 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4833417 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4833418 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4833419 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4833420 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4833421 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4833422 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4833423 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4833424 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4833425 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4833426 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4833427 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4833428 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4833429 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4833430 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4833431 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4833432 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4833433 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4833434 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4833435 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4833436 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4833437 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4833438 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4833439 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4833440 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4833441 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4833442 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4833443 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4833444 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4833445 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4833446 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4833447 when it is resolved i mean the underlying conflict it must be resolved on the basis of the territorial integrity of georgia
4833448 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4833449 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4833450 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4833451 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4833452 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis

4833456 when considering beneficiary requests for distributions thought needs to be given to the availability of surplus income at the time that the request is being made in the administration of estates and trusts at times income is used to preserve and enhance the value of assets for the benefit of all beneficiaries
4833457 the goal is to bring people together and to modify the behaviour of some of these trustees

4833476 it was more out of interest its completely standard technology i just got the data to see what format it was in

4833518 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4833519 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4833520 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4833521 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4833522 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4833523 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4833524 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4833525 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4833526 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4833527 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
4833528 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
4833529 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
4833530 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
4833531 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
4833532 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
4833533 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
4833534 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
4833535 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
4833536 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
4833537 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
4833538 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
4833539 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
4833540 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
4833541 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia

4833543 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
4833544 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
4833545 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
4833546 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
4833547 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
4833548 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4833549 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4833550 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
4833551 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
4833552 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4833553 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4833554 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
4833555 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
4833556 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
4833557 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
4833558 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
4833559 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
4833560 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
4833561 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4833562 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4833563 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
4833564 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
4833565 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
4833566 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4833567 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4833568 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
4833569 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4833570 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
4833571 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4833572 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4833573 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4833574 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4833575 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4833576 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4833577 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4833578 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4833579 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4833580 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4833581 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4833582 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4833583 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4833584 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4833585 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4833586 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4833587 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4833588 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4833589 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4833590 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4833591 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4833592 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4833593 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4833594 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4833595 i dont think anybody here believes that is it easier to win without peyton no its going to be tougher but if it happens well believe we can get it done
4833596 i think the bottom line is that i expect peyton to be back ive been with him everything is going like we expect it to
4833597 do i wish everyone was 100 healthy of course but in this business you have to be able to fight through it you have to be able to deal with injuries and go forward
4833598 i dont worry about that i leave that stuff up to the training staff
4833599 everybody has confidence in each other so we dont worry about that stuff
4833600 you cant look at it as we have a built in excuse
4833601 if hes not back by the fourth preseason game youve got to handle that if hes not back for the first regular season youve got to handle it but hes on schedule
4833602 i couldnt have been asked to shoot against a better shooter
4833603 i hoped he wouldnt miss because tore and me are really good friends but i could feel the nervousness building inside me so i was hoping it wouldnt last much longer
4833604 the game plan was to hit every shot if you are perfect nobody can beat you
4833605 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4833606 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4833607 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4833608 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

4833630 i am just amazed by what a wonderful show china has put on
4833631 i mean we keep comparing china and india but after coming here i realise there is no comparison
4833632 its the discipline of the people they the chinese are so polite and so united in their efforts to demonstrate to the world what they can do
4833633 to be honest we felt quite left out of the games
4833634 apart from us there are hardly any indians at any of the events even the smaller countries have visible fans a voice but in the matches weve been to there is no one to cheer along with us

4833652 slamming lawyers is fun for some and an agenda for others the outrage about the ads has supplanted the outrage as to the possible wrong done by comair bluegrass field and the faa is there a statute that would prohibit an insurance company or defendant in a civil case from preying upon a grieving relative by having them sign on a lesser settlement than they might receive with counsel if 45 days must pass prior to an ad by a law firm it should be required that 90 days pass before a final settlement is final thus giving someone no longer distraught time to rescind an agreement as much as some may distrust attorneys insurance companies are much more predatory the role of the attorney in protecting the victim from the predators who would scam them into a settlement of less than full value is very important certainly protect those individuals from preying attorneys during their time of grief but also protect them from insurance company representatives and defendants representatives including their attorneys by putting into place a period in which either the victim is not approached for settlement or in the event settlement is reached during that say 45 day period that the victim has at least 90 days to rescind these families lost fathers mothers sons daughters lawyers arent the only predators in these woods nor are they the most dangerous

4833659 they put the protection of the killers above the attainment of justice
4833660 the very serious concerns about how the police handled this investigation from beginning to end
4833661 that is why my position is to support the calls that are made by families here for the establishment of an independent tribunal
4833662 they obviously have lost all faith and we have seen debacle after debacle in terms of the investigation of this terrible atrocity what we need to do is support the families in the demands they now make
4833663 one of the things that surprised me because i grew up in england was that people here northern ireland protestants and i only learned this fairly recently protestants would have been taught as children that they could not trust catholics i found that astonishing but when i explored it with protestant friends they all agreed that was the case
4833664 i could never understand why it mattered that i was a catholic police ombudsman it baffled me but eventually i was told this was the teaching of some churches to their people and that meant i could understand a lot of what has been said about me

4833667 it appears to be more difficult for a north of irelander to allow an honest difference of opinion in an opponent so that he is apt to regard the terms opponent and enemy as synonymous
4833668 the short answer is his people are indeed from ulster from county antrim ireland they left from coleraine town circa 1719 and appear on the border of the pennsylvania and maryland colony in the early 1720s his immigrant ancestor was named alexander mckean and yes the two lads who run the ulster heritage dna project are from the same mccain family

4833670 co operation ireland has been very successful in a conflict situation for the last 30 years but the context has changed out there and the challenge will be to be as equally successful in the next 30 years of co operation ireland in a different context
4833671 youre in a peace building context people have this view that the peace is done and its all over and to some extent that part of the conflict is over but its by no means stable yet yes a lot of the engagement has been at the top political level but actually the grassroots hasnt been engaged in it
4833672 all of that political agreement needs stabilised and needs underpinned at the grassroots level which is what peacebuildings about in some ways the peace making is a pragmatic enterprise whereas peace building is much more vision oriented its not about single events its about process and a process that will take years and so the context becomes more difficult
4833673 an mx registered truck probably wont be automatically excluded from getting grant funding
4833674 however it will need to meet all the standard criteria be assured that no truck will be funded under either ports funds unless it can be shown to meet all program requirements as a legitimate frequent tripper and contributor to the ports air quality programs
4833675 it appears that certain mexican trucking companies could meet the requirements of this program

4833677 if not for the perverted economic model that has developed in the ports there would be no need to subsidize port replacement trucks in the first place

4833679 the footage aired by the british tv channel was preceded with a picture of a road sign displaying the name of the town gori written in georgian and english languages the report also said that a sky news correspondent was reporting from the georgian town
4833680 what became the picture that mike jeremy of itn pegged one of the key images of the war in the former yugoslavia qtd in deichmann p 170 was in fact presented as to the western world as something it was not a concentration camp the focus was on fikret alic whos protruding rib cage behind a fence conjured up images of nazi death camps this death camp was a crude sick lie and fikret alic who survived the war was disturbed about the use of his image

4833937 a new trend within bank owned foreclosures may be causing an artificial price jump that could cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars some real estate experts said beefed up code enforcement of bank owned homes is leading to more violations and liens being placed on foreclosed properties officials said
4833938 the problem for taxpayers kcra 3 has learned is that multiple banks instead of paying those fees to fix the properties are dropping sale prices as much as 50 percent to get the property out of their hands
4833939 what they code enforcement agencies are doing is not forcing the bank to fix it up said mike lyon of lyon real estate
4833940 when the buyers at el cortez signed stacks of papers to purchase their condos in fall 2004 and 2005 they signed a two page item called a repurchase addendum buyers say it was marketed to them as a protection if they had any qualms with the developer over the construction or design of the project the developer would purchase their unit back at whatever the current market value would be
4833941 they signed it in the heady days when appreciation in real estate seemed a sure thing it seemed like a satisfaction guaranteed promise at a store
4833942 the way the real estate agents presented it it was like a comforting thing said barry bruins one of the first condo buyers at el cortez and the president of the buildings hoa
4833943 barry and his wife deborah bruins own a condo in the building for which they paid 419 000 in fall 2004 they were among the first buyers in the building after it was converted to condos by developers peter janopaul and anthony block
4833944 in fall 2006 the bruins added their names to the list of plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the centre city development corp and the developers alleging fraud breach of fiduciary duty and construction defects
4833945 since last summer the bruins have received letters from the developers threatening to invoke the repurchase addendum that would force them to sell their condo back to the developers for 260 000 which the letters claimed was the current market value the bruins refused in march the bruins were served with a lawsuit
4833946 judge ronald s prager found that the bruins lawsuit against the developer fit within their constitutionally protected rights in a final ruling issued last friday the provisions of the repurchase addendum are highly unconscionable the judge wrote in his ruling
4833947 he wrote that the contract was oppressive because it left buyers of the condos with no choice in the frenzied real estate market of 2004 and 2005 buyers signed purchase documents and closed sales as quickly as possible by the time buyers found the item in their purchase agreement they knew that if they refused to sign the forms their unit would be snapped up by another buyer the judge wrote
4833948 but does anyone think that adding more houses to the vast overbuilding is an answer at this point
4833949 one of the big problems with losing your job is the lack of esteem that comes with it
4833950 add a workplace that is winding down not expanding and pretty soo it starts playing with your mind when you cant find work or have to drastically lower your sights to get a job any job
4833951 but people must see that we have experienced a once in a lifetime financial mania in housing and such programs are simply not going to work
4833952 justin harp bought a three bedroom one bath home in felton for 350 000 for their family of three
4833953 you are my friend please advise me what i should do
4833954 mr prime minister in the game of diplomacy and power nobody is any one elses friend i am only a messenger at this time you should consult one of your own advisors
4833955 i still consider you my friend despite that and so request your advice
4833956 basically i have come not to advise but to warn you usa has numerous reservations about pakistans atomic programme therefore you have no way out except agreeing to what i say
4833957 pakistan can live without the us president now your people will have to find some other ally in this region
4833958 you people think that we cannot live without your help remember that pakistan is a strong and powerful country and if we can make russia run away from afghanistan then we can also cope with usa
4833959 tell your government that you have no option except our friendship
4833960 sir ten or eleven years ago i was working with mr bhutto sir i saw and heard the dialogue between henry kissinger and mr zulfikar ali bhutto myself personally mr bhutto looked very confident after this conversation but kissinger looked grim mr bhutto had later started challenging the usa even in his public utterances however sir a time came when you dethroned bhutto and delivered him to the judiciary the courts sentenced him to gallows and thus mr bhutto really became an example of retribution for the world
4833961 sir when you were berating the us ambassador publicly to me he looked very much like henry kissinger at the time sir based on my experience i know that a time comes during friendship with america when it becomes difficult for us friends to maintain that friendship and the amity pinches like a thorn in the shoe
4833962 sir during our return in the car i had tried to advise mr zulfiqar ali bhutto also but he stopped the car and had asked me to get out mr bhutto believed that he knew the americans better than the americans knew themselves sir i know that you also will not be pleased with what i have to say and perhaps this time also i may meet the same treatment but sir in this delicate hour i consider it my duty to advise you please dont get entangled with the americans at this time they are a generation of disposable culture in their view faithfulness and constancy are meaningless words
4833963 both of my bosses did not accept my advise therefore both of them met a tragic end
4833964 this is american nature in reality they cannot maintain companionship with any one for a long time only if you have a love hate relationship with the us you can keep their company for a long period
4833965 in return we had given you the opportunity to govern pakistan
4833966 if americans do not help us in the war against terror then they should search for some other ally for themselves

4834121 if we imagine this being of the individual as a larger or smaller room it is obvious that most people come to know only one corner of their room one spot near the window one narrow strip on which they keep walking back and forth in this way they have a certain security and yet how much more human is the dangerous insecurity that drives those prisoners in poes stories to feel out the shapes of their horrible dungeons and not be strangers to the unspeakable terror of their cells we however are not prisoners no traps or snares have been set around us and there is nothing that should frighten or upset us we have been put into life as into the element we most accord with and we have moreover through thousands of years of adaptation come to resemble this life so greatly that when we hold still through a fortunate mimicry we can hardly be differentiated from everything around us we have no reason to harbor any mistrust against our world for it is not against us if it has terrors they are our terrors if it has abysses these abysses belong to us if there are dangers we must try to love them
4834122 this aggression does not serve efforts being exerted to achieve calm and it obstructs the peace process

4834124 its nearly impossible to estimate how many but in nearly every u s city churches are hosting passover seders and encouraging non jewish families to embrace this biblical holiday
4834125 i wish we had the data to accurately estimate the number
4834126 because i sus pect it may be even greater than we think
4834127 there is a greater desire for a judaic footing in the teachings of the church today twenty years ago christians par ticipated in the passover seder as a fun cultural experience and then went on their way but today many are engaging this observance as their own
4834128 but its a real trend that indicates a growing appreciation that jesus and the apostles were really jewish and they did really jewish things
4834129 most people in our congregation have mainstream protestant backgrounds they celebrate the resurrection of jesus but they do it in conjunction with passover
4834130 jesus is beginning to be re contextualized back into his proper cultural and historical setting there are a lot of christians who place a high value on biblical authority and theyre serious enough to re examine their own practices for authenticity
4834131 when you read the biblical prophecies of revelation daniel and others within their jewish contexts it becomes pretty clear that when jesus returns hell still be jewish thats bound to surprise some people

4834150 we need to see the region not in its millennial abstraction and mystifi cation but as like europe latin america and east asia a product of modern international economic political and social forces
4834151 the institutions of coercion administration and territorial delimitation it is states that shape identities religions economies there is no such thing as the middle eastern state the oriental state the arab state the islamic state there are entities which rule coerce tax spend mobilise in the modern regional and international context in which they find themselves and equally importantly it is the desire to control the state or else to set up their own separate state as today with the kurds palestinians and southern sudanese and earlier with the zionist movement in palestine that explains the politics of opposition groups be they democratic authoritarian or insurrectionary
4834152 even as regional forces are at play be it in regard to nuclear weapons migration flows or terrorism the 25 countries of the region remain distinct and in some ways separated from each other a system of interacting units but not a homogenous whole this means that with specific conflicts such as the arab israeli dispute or the iran iraq war or now the multi layered war in iraq we should be careful how far we see these conflicts as dominating or defining the region as a whole

4834154 many complementary methods are extremely popular among cancer survivors who are spending a lot of their time money and attention on them

4834160 the evil that men do lives after them in lyttons case in 27 novels whose perfervid turgidity i intend to expose denude and generally make visible
4834161 i very strongly feel that to be the first person to come up with a cliche is genius
4834162 i agree now that the words are cliched but if youre the first to pen them then surely thats a remarkable thing something to be proud of
4834163 sitting on top of his kennel snoopy trying to write his novel only ever gets as far as it was a dark and stormy night
4834164 im ready to concede the guy did have some powers of invention
4834165 some people credit him with creating the historical novel as we know it
4834166 i think he was just very melodramatic and reached too hard for effects i think he was very pretentious he was convinced he was a genius
4834167 it was a dark and stormy night the rain fell in torrents except at occasional intervals when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets for it is in london that our scene lies rattling along the housetops and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness
4834168 lord lytton was also deeply concerned about the welfare of b c s first nations and sent specific instructions to gov james douglas in that regard

4834173 i want to find more about what this is about
4834174 we will be asking our general counsel to advise us on what more we should be doing about this

4834177 i think all along that pitching coach mel stottlemyre and r a have felt than in a perfect world the best way for him to help the club is out of the bullpen
4834178 when something is taken away from you you feel a little disappointed
4834179 but the reality is that as a team we are trying to evaluate what we have and i get that im not going to a place im totally uncomfortable
4834180 i feel i can do a good job there for a long time
4834181 i feel i am going to get better this is only my third year of throwing a knuckleball and i have a better feel for it i made big strides this year even from last year and the possibility of going down to atlanta and working with phil niekro during the offseason makes it even better
4834182 given the talent level of the teams we had we had real legitimate chances to win to not win it you scratch your head but then you look and realize the teams we played against deserved to be there too
4834183 i really had never seen a list of the names in the team hall or paid much attention to it because i never thought id be in it
4834184 you look at names like hal trosky early wynn bob feller cy young lou boudreau herb score and it really hits home this is a really special occasion
4834185 my entire life its been hard for me to ever put myself in a position to where its about me
4834186 sparky anderson told me in mid 1995 youll never get the credit that you deserve for managing these teams because i never did in cincinnati either that really doesnt bother me
4834187 that was such an emotional time that i never really sat down beforehand to put into words what i felt
4834188 i really did misspeak when i said i lost my passion i think my competitive edge was dulled i had to work at getting ready for the game where before it was just there as a player and as a coach
4834189 being around those college kids and watching how they play the game and realizing they love the game as much as the big leaguers do it got me going
4834190 i realized i had not lost my competitive edge and that was a good thing to find out
4834191 one more time one more shot without a doubt but it would really have to be the right circumstance
4834192 the people who offered me the job would have to be convinced i wouldnt quit on them
4834193 i got a deeper satisfaction out of what i did as a manager than as a player
4834194 the managing side was more meaningful we were playing for something in october and thats what its all about

4834466 here is the prepared report some athlete in some field of sports achieved what representatives from 22 arab countries did not manage to achieve however thank god they are all members of amr moussas arab league and maybe thats their only life achievement and for this we must be thankful
4834467 the arabs in general did not succeed with allahs help to attain even one wooden or plastic medal not even so that arab nationalists and their cardboard parties would be able to boast about them in their election propaganda on tv and on the radio as an important and huge arab achievement so that they could convince people that they are like the rest of the world
4834468 yes in the largest olympics in the history of humankind the arabs despite their intelligence services and their spies didnt achieve a thing
4834469 god help us how did he turn into the most decorated athlete in olympic history
4834470 despite the fact that this heretic who should burn in hell is not part of the best nation the arab nation although he is not married to any of the naked american women or to minors or girls look at him
4834471 its important to be ranked going into the season now because of the bcs deal its like starting ahead a little bit
4834472 the legislature and the governor changed our marriage laws to please the well connected minority and force a social experiment into other states thats very offensive to a majority of the people at least the way the votes have been going

4834486 in the end i believe it is the poets manners how he deals with people on a daily basis that makes him a real prince
4834487 and therefore the title bears the poet with the responsibility to represent all the other poets of the arab world in a positive way i hope
4834488 the prince of poets needs to be a poet with his words but also a poet through his deeds
4834489 we would like to console the arab world and those who fought for human rights for their loss of a great poet

4834511 we require students to demonstrate that they can cope with the workload of taking three a levels in one sitting for this reason candidates who take an a level early due to outstanding ability in that subject or any other reason will still be expected to take three a levels at the end of the two sixth form years these students may therefore need to take more than the usual number of a levels so that they can satisfy our requirement of taking three in one sitting

4834523 i very strongly feel that to be the first person to come up with a cliche is genius

4834525 sitting on top of his kennel snoopy trying to write his novel only ever gets as far as it was a dark and stormy night
4834526 im ready to concede the guy did have some powers of invention
4834527 some people credit him with creating the historical novel as we know it
4834528 i think he was just very melodramatic and reached too hard for effects i think he was very pretentious he was convinced he was a genius
4834529 it was a dark and stormy night the rain fell in torrents except at occasional intervals when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets for it is in london that our scene lies rattling along the housetops and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness

4834619 i know people think that acting is not quite the occupation of grown ups but it is actually the ultimate learning process you get a multitude of experiences all for the price of one life
4834620 i danced from the age of three i was always in amateur dramatics and i did a lot of public speaking so when i told my family i was going to be an actress well it was like when your camp best friend tells you hes gay and youre trying really hard to look surprised even so it was one of the worst years of my life i was an usher at the lion king i was an office temp the epitome of spiritual bankruptcy and even a cocktail waitress sorry a mixologist i can still free pour a double vodka

4834645 we have won at everton and not many teams do that apart from the top four it was a great achievement
4834646 we told homeowners to treat their homes like securities investments and they did

4834651 after europes capitalist revolution napoleon came along to institutionalise socialism in russia lenin appeared
4834652 in nepal to institutionalise the federal democratic republic after 10 years of peoples war and mass popular movement prachanda is here
4834653 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal under the leadership of prachanda the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4834654 were in talks with the parties in our alliance and hope to form a government in the next few days
4834655 the integration of the peoples liberation army into the nepal army will see lots of arguments and counter arguments the way they deal with the army is very crucial
4834656 the maoists will try to bring in populist and radical economic reforms but financially they will have lots of constraints
4834657 he is a communist hardliner but now he has a responsibility to meet the standards of democratic principles
4834658 this is an acid test for him to prove his commitment to democracy
4834659 at a time when the united states has a lame duck president and neither partys presidential candidate has the power to do more than issue statements condemning russias actions

4834662 of course by all accounts the divorce was completely amicable after john and carol mccains divorce there was apparently some confusion about belongings that were roberta mccains but we understand the court papers were unintentionally filed and the matter never went further in the legal system it went nowhere and was of no consequence

4834664 you can be sure that i talked to and got the permission of any client who is listed as a plaintiff

4834671 the fact that the carry trade appears to be ending is an indication that institutional investors are concerned the global economy is slowing
4834672 the euro zone reported a 0 2 gdp decline for q1 including declines in germany and france its two largest economies theres concern about a substantial slowing in the united kingdom and we know about the u s economic distress the pull back in the carry trade is a statement by institutional investors that they expect the worlds major economies to slow in q3 and q4 if not longer
4834673 capital continually scans the world in search of return and yield when that capital starts returning home in this case with the tapering of carry trades in the cheap yen thats a signal that institutional investors believe the global economy is slowing
4834674 so look for the global economy to continue to slow through q4 of this year

4834694 none of us really approve of bulwer lytton being used as an example of bad writing hes a great hero to us all over here
4834695 is a whimsical literary competition that challenges entrants to compose the opening sentence to the worst of all possible novels
4834696 in keeping with the gravitas high seriousness and general bignitude of the contest the grand prize winner will receive a pittance
4834697 the evil that men do lives after them in lyttons case in 27 novels whose perfervid turgidity i intend to expose denude and generally make visible
4834698 i very strongly feel that to be the first person to come up with a cliche is genius

4834704 it was a dark and stormy night the rain fell in torrents except at occasional intervals when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets for it is in london that our scene lies rattling along the housetops and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness

4834773 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories

4834868 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4834869 gosh and all this time i thought it was because producers want you to buy both the box set and the obvious title they left out no they would never do that would they

4834876 the eighth day of the eighth month of 2008 and finally i was leaving florida i had arrived that morning friday from the bahamas hours it took to disembark the boat not till two in the am was i off and through passport control another three months stamped into my passport i didnt make it far down the road i pulled off and got a motel in west palm beach i awoke in the morning at the super 8 i opened the door to my room number 108 to see a car parked next to my bike brunhilda thom names all his vehicles the last three digits read eight zero zero the day had certainly begun auspiciously it was again a hot day cycling through the information on brunhildas computer display i read the temperature at 96 degrees an hour out of orlando i could see that was going to change as i was driving right into a storm the sky dark with black cloud lit on occasion by a flash of lightning the rain began to come down hard bouncing off the road a bolt of lightning hitting the median between the highway i thought at first the shock on my hand was the electricity but convinced myself instead that it was just the pelting rain on my exposed hand the heat of the day quickly gave way to a chill as my jeans became soaked and the singlet beneath my mesh kevlar jacket drew in water i saw a bridge flying over the turnpike and considered seeking cover under it to put on my gortex underjacket it came and went in a flash hestitation determining for me to go on i had come to expect these storms to last no more than an hour and riding at 80 miles an hour to move through them even quicker this one was to last longer than expected but eventually i could see light slowly show itself in a corner of the darkness lighting white the spray coming high off the tires of the vehicles in front of me turning vibrant the green of the adjacent fields the rain ended and the pavement became dry the sun broke through the clouds and i was assaulted by its heat i was dry with in half an hour cleared orlando rode the turnpike till its end the afternoon quickly fading into evening north i continued to my right i spied a massive roadside billboard 888 admit it so true i thought above written much smaller if gambling is a problem call i couldnt help but chuckle saw the blue shield of the interstate with 10 emblazoned on it i exited off the 75 the single lane splitting green signs hanging above the road east to jacksonville declared one the other west to tallahassee the roadside artfully planted with palm and pine i kept left following the road as it crested a rise and turned into the setting sun yes west cried my heart west yeah hes a bit of a strange duck i thought i would cut and paste this em in answer to your question no no longer in florida leaving new orleans today for new mexico a few days journey on soon to be in the deserts of nevada for burning man
4834877 california public school students are continuing to make solid steady progress learning the skills and concepts necessary for success in school and in life since 2003 532 494 more california students have become proficient in english language arts and 415 129 more students have become proficient in math while we still have a lot of work to do to reach our goal of universal proficiency this years gains are particularly encouraging considering they build upon five years of steady growth
4834878 the results also show significant increases in science and social science california has some of the highest standards in the nation and i am exceptionally proud of the hard work and dedication of our students teachers administrators paraprofessionals and parents that led to this achievement
4834879 while we celebrate the progress made by all subgroups of students over the last five years we can not lose sight of the fact that more than half of our students and too many students of color are still not meeting our high standards
4834880 it is good news that all students continue to improve it is imperative that we help those students who have historically struggled the most to accelerate their learning so they may effectively and fully participate in school the workforce and in society
4834881 it is a moral and economic imperative that we close the achievement gap california cannot afford to allow our latino students and our african american students to continue to lag academically behind their peers
4834882 while we must close the gap that exists between all subgroups i am acutely concerned about our african american students african american students as a whole scored in english language arts just one point above latino students a subgroup that includes a significant number of english learners this coupled with an alarming dropout rate among african americans indicates a crisis in the education of black children
4834883 my statewide p 16 council has made a series of recommendations aimed at closing the achievement gap and improving the way we provide education services to african american students we must redouble our efforts to find and share effective strategies that will help african american students succeed

4834886 one of the fundamental questions that neuroscientists are facing today is how we link the activity of individual neurons to the complex behaviours that we see in whole organisms and whole animals
4834887 this project gives us a really useful and unique opportunity to look at something that may exhibit whole behaviours but still remains closely tied to the activity of individual neurons

4834896 le pr sident medvedev ma assur hier que votre signature conduirait au retrait des forces russes conform ment laccord conclu
4834897 les forces militaires russes devront se retirer sur les lignes ant rieures au d clenchement des hostilit s
4834898 dans lattente dun m canisme international les forces de maintien de la paix russes mettront en oeuvre des mesures additionnelles de s curit
4834899 ne pourront tre mises en oeuvre que dans limm diate proximit de loss tie du sud lexclusion de toute autre partie du territoire g orgien
4834900 plus pr cis ment elles ne pourront tre mises en oeuvre qu lint rieur dune zone dune profondeur de quelques kilom tres depuis la limite administrative entre loss tie du sud et le reste de la g orgie de fa on ce quaucun centre urbain significatif ny soit inclus je pense en particulier la ville de gori

4834902 les russes ne quittent pas la g orgie comme ils ont pris lengagement ce samedi matin
4834903 nous avons t bloqu s lentr e de gori par des chars russes
4834904 et nous avons vu cette occasion un tr s important dispositif militaire russe partir dans la direction de tbilissi
4834905 je parle dun bataillon assez lourdement quip je ne sais pas o allait ce bataillon mais clairement il ne prenait pas la direction du nord or la russie cest vers le nord je suis l pour constater que les russes ne quittent pas la g orgie comme ils en ont pris lengagement ce samedi matin
4834906 et au milieu de gori nous avons constat quil ny avait quasiment plus personne part un gouverneur et un d put du parlement g orgien qui gardent les populations civiles tr s peu nombreuses des femmes avec des enfants qui nont presque plus rien manger donc le message que je fais passer ce samedi soir cest quil faut donner de quoi manger aux populations civiles de gori
4834907 nest pas visible dans la ville puisque dapr s ce que nous ont dit les quelques personnes que nous avons crois es les gens se cachent les gens ont peur des maraudeurs qui viennent la nuit voler dans les maisons et qui repartent avec des camions charg s de tout ce quils ont pu voler aux populations civiles

4834945 representa una ruptura por parte del partido un nuevo tiempo del compromiso que todos suscribimos el 23 de enero
4834946 pol ticamente inaceptable que una organizaci n pol tica sin tener con qu pretenda obtener siete alcald as en el rea capital exigimos a todas las organizaciones pol ticas que respalden a antonio ledezma no podemos seguir perdiendo el tiempo haciendo encuestas y compitiendo entre nosotros tampoco se puede garantizar que se hagan las primarias
4834947 es que respete la unidad as como nosotros respetamos la candidatura de pablo p rez y manuel rosales en el zulia exigimos lo mismo
4834948 y miente porque es antonio ledezma quien lideriza las encuestas y est respaldado por m s de veinte organizaciones pol ticas y de la sociedad civil
4834949 mientras que al se or william ojeda solamente lo apoya un nuevo tiempo partido que rompi el pacto de unidad al inscribir un candidato que tiene baja figuraci n en las encuestas
4834950 la inscripci n a ltima hora de william ojeda fue de acuerdo a informaciones que poseemos fue por una exigencia muy particular de manuel rosales y omar barboza en el caso de antonio ledezma todas las encuestas y sondeos de opini n a n las que tiene manuel rosales en su poder que son tres dos de ellas hechas por solicitud de leopoldo l pez y otra por rosales de firmas reconocidas en todas en la intenci n del voto antonio ledezma supera abiertamente a william ojeda
4834951 as que no es verdad lo que dijo ayer omar barboza de que quien superaba en las encuestas era william ojeda eso no es verdad es antonio ledezma quien supera en la intenci n del voto en otras encuestas consultores 21 datan lisis y otras la ventaja de antonio ledezma sobre william ojeda es enorme la clara evidencia de superioridad en las encuestas de ledezma frente a ojeda no admite discusi n y es por ello que estamos pidiendo que se aplique se respete y se cumpla el pacto del 23 de enero
4834952 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4834953 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4834954 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4834955 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4834956 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4834957 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
4834958 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also
4834959 individual bishops have always made their own decisions within the canonical responsibilities of their dioceses
4834960 the christian with the new insight cant claim straight away that
4834961 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
4834962 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective
4834963 the obama camp doesnt want to seem as if theyre trying to shove the clintons out of the way that theyre trying to do like the old soviet union and destroy all the statues
4834964 there was no expectation that this guy was going to be a tv guy
4834965 others who are in the space tend to draw more attention to themselves than chuck does
4834966 im really trying to make sure i never go on the air when i have nothing to talk about
4834967 i want to make sure that the people who do pay attention to what i say they feel like they learn something every time
4834968 this campaign coverage has really bounced from controversy to controversy gaffe pingpong
4834969 and that is very much how cable tends to operate
4834970 cable really has replaced broadcast for convention coverage and real political debate and discussion
4834971 i spent an evening not just me alone with michelle obama and became aware of what they were all about
4834972 00 honda e x honda coupe reclining bucket seats 2700 new jersey us
4834973 ronaldos ripped body slicked back hair shiny white teeth and jewellery swung the votes his way
4834974 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4834975 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film released july 11 2007 which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4834976 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4834977 post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the will not be affected by this change
4834978 i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of director david yates and our incomparable cast
4834979 i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4834980 even as we put finishing touches on this latest film
4834981 we are already beginning preparations on the final two films and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve
4834982 he didnt look good to me and i knew this could be it
4834983 i said hey bernard how are you and i kissed his forehead
4834984 he shrugged his shoulders like im tired and i said i know youre tired later on that night it took a turn for the worse
4834985 the doctor came in and i said hes gone isnt he
4834986 he said you never seen a black man as pretty as me
4834987 i said what do you have for me and he kissed me that was our first kiss
4834988 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4834989 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that senator mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4834990 a mount gambier woman has warned the community of the dangers of cleaning lawnmowers in the bedroom while smoking

4834995 weve already visited this idea and heres why we gave it up
4834996 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4834997 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4834998 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4834999 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4835000 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4835001 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4835002 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4835007 it was always turmoil between our camp and his camp us as the bosses of our companies everyone is gonna follow our lead wed figure if it aint no problem and we dont have no issues no beef then theres no reason we shouldnt be able to get together and make music that was an executive decision that was made on both our behalves
4835008 i was surprised just as much as everybody else was
4835009 i talked to luda and he said it was time to sit down do business make grown man moves both of them got albums coming out time to try new things cris did something for t i too that nobody heard yet its about to come out soon its a good move
4835010 its showing that once great minds set their differences aside they can make something happen
4835011 thats two grown men not two grown males grown men
4835012 and i aint no preacher but heres my erick sermon

4835018 has it come to this has the magical impact of george lucas original vision of star wars been reduced to the level of saturday morning animation

4835020 we saw this in a theater full of kids and there wasnt a single moment that caused spontaneous cheering
4835021 ziro the hutt is perhaps the most bizarre character ever created in the series history yes including jar jar a jabba shaped slug who wears face paint and feathers the creature speaks english rather than huttese except that he she somehow has the accent of truman capote by way of eric cartman of south park
4835022 i found it impossible to concentrate on much of anything she he was saying except to imagine that all of this would one day make for a great book entitled in cold hutt naturally
4835023 the character was so bad so incredibly awful that it was a slap to the face it is many times worse than im actually describing this character was actually too much for me
4835024 after meeting ahsoka we really understand why he killed all the younglings id have done it with my bare hands she calls him skyguy which is amazingly annoying and he calls her snips
4835025 of course the anakin ahsoka relationship is made impossibly awkward by the fact that shes half naked and 12 and that theyre always in close quarters i dont need the force to see this fan fiction coming
4835026 we play the same whether were in front of 100 000 people or 10 people

4835073 we come to bear a message of brotherhood and peace for all the people of kirkuk kurds arabs turkomans chaldeans and assyrians
4835074 the issue of kirkuk is very clear there is a constitution approved by the majority of the people of iraq there is article 140 in this constitution related to kirkuk article 140 of the constitution will not be cancelled until all its provisions are implemented
4835075 we believe that the kurdistan region is a region for all kurds arabs turkomans chaldeans and assyrians
4835076 this resolution of the current conflict is first and foremost the responsibility of the people of kirkuk outsiders can only have a helping role however i think there are some external people who are trying to manipulate this internal process to determine the fate of kirkuk for their own ends

4835176 during the recent operations in basra sadr city and maysan iraqi troops uncovered convincing evidence that iranian lethal aid has continued to flow into iraq
4835177 whereas iran has proved time and again its good intention to help iraqs stabilisation development and prosperity through close cooperation with the iraqi government in different fields as well as to help iraqi people overcome their immense difficulties the u s government unwarrantedly insists on its unacceptable behaviour in scape goating others including iran for its own wrong policies in iraq

4835184 a true patriot is a lover of his country who rebukes and does not excuse its sins
4835185 we have to be careful in each word we write
4835186 if we write something that isnt in favour of the militants resistance groups the military or the government then we are in a dangerous situation
4835187 for being iraqis we are in a more delicate situation because we dont have anywhere to hide or anyone to support
4835188 sometimes we have to hide behind foreigners to be protected
4835189 nothing is being done to protect journalists covering the iraq situation
4835190 it is becoming intolerable especially when you see that the proposed democracy is just for politicians but not for other professionals or ordinary iraqis
4835191 in addition to being easy targets to survive we have to accept working as journalists but having our names hidden while foreigners take all the credit by using our stories under their by line
4835192 they dont offer any protection and even if we are killed our families dont have the right of insurance as they have
4835193 my son was killed for speaking with a journalist about us elections
4835194 they made him two questions and it was enough reason for them to kill him he wasnt aware of the new law imposed in our district and was a victim of the daily violence in iraq where democracy is just an illusion http www islamonline net servlet

4835218 we were obviously disappointed that we couldnt make the gold medal match but its going to be something really special to us to have that medal back at home

4835223 its not the first time this tournament or in my life i had to serve for a big match
4835224 its basically the moment you dream of being in even though there is so much pressure to it
4835225 i didnt sleep enough im just really happy that i could put all my energy into the match and pull out the match

4835256 sister a real terrible thing has happened to our town
4835257 weve got a lot of people here who need help we cant just throw them out on the street
4835258 theyre our family theyve made their homes here had jobs here raised families here
4835259 this town has constantly been changing it had opened its heart to change but now i sense anguish within people
4835260 they are asking whats going to happen to the town
4835261 a lot of good workers were taken away a lot of good families are gone
4835262 the community is drained of our giving energy of wondering how long the new people will stay if it will be a culture that fits into our community we are grieving scared apprehensive
4835263 i am very nervous i dont know what is going to happen and i dont know if i have the strength to keep fighting
4835264 i wish i could plead with the judge for my childrens sake that he would give me a little more time here so my children could continue studying so i could keep working
4835265 you come here with so many plans and illusions that your children will do better than you did
4835266 what joy that gives me to hear i see that they could have a future
4835267 it wounds my soul to think that i might not be able to give them what they desire to think that i might fail them
4835268 i wish people could put themselves in our situation for one moment what would they do if they were poor if they were in dire need wouldnt they risk coming here as well
4835269 i wish that the hearts of people with hearts of stone of ice the people of ice could be transformed into good hearts we came here to work not to do harm to anyone
4835270 they are serious offenses and we will not apologize for enforcing the nations laws if 305 u s citizens had committed identity theft and misuse of social security numbers would people expect us to look the other way
4835271 any disruption whether to families or communities should be put at the feet of those who violate the law
4835272 what happened here is a microcosm of whats happening in the country
4835273 if nothing is done there will be many many more postvilles around the country and thats not healthy for anyone
4835274 i hope our little town will survive i think it will
4835275 weve gotten through lots of things and well get through this too itll take awhile and its tough but were just a resilient bunch in iowa

4835327 of course if you found his corpse and could extract his dna eventually at some point in the future youd be able to clone the perfect warrior do you think the department of defense would want an army of genghis khans
4835328 it is not at all unusual for both parties in large negotiations like ours to meet in smaller more manageable groups to talk about remaining outstanding issues in an effort to reach accord
4835329 claims by sags negotiators about informal talks are no more true today than they were when first made two weeks ago
4835330 negotiations concluded when the producers presented their final offer on june 30 2008 and no meetings are scheduled
4835331 the undisputed fact is that until sags negotiators make a deal their members will work indefinitely under an expired contract enjoying none of the pay increases protections or new media residuals that all of the other guilds are receiving
4835332 the amptp is always interested in exploring ways to reach an agreement and if sag has an approach thats consistent with the parameters of our june 30 final offer then we are open to hearing that
4835333 your negotiating team remains committed to opposing the amptps proposals to produce original made for new media productions non union with no residuals
4835334 they hope this threat will stampede our membership to take a bad deal
4835335 the risk that actors may not receive increases retroactively is more than offset by the long term damage that would result from a premature deal that eliminates residuals for work done for new media and reused on new media or from allowing signatory producers to produce non union

4835379 it seems that sensory input is setting the background level of activity inside the brain
4835380 its like training an animal to do something by gradual increments
4835381 this system is a model everything it does is merely similar to what goes on in a brain its not really the same thing we can learn about the brain but it may mislead us
4835382 models and the like if their psychology is as rich as or richer than these humans to think otherwise is irrational
4835383 to describe an animal as a physico chemical system of extreme complexity is no doubt perfectly correct except that it misses out on the animalness of the animal
4835384 there is no fundamental difference between humans and the higher mammals in their mental faculties
4835385 if you can justify killing to eat meat you can justify the conditions of the ghetto i cannot justify either one
4835386 the reasons for legal intervention in favor of children apply not less strongly to the case of those unfortunate slaves the other animals
4835387 compassion in action may be the glorious possibility that could protect our crowded polluted planet
4835388 we need a moral philosophy in which the concept of love so rarely mentioned now by philosophers can once again be made central
4835389 humaneness is not a dead external precept but a living impulse from within not self sacrifice but self fulfillment
4835390 the greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be measured by the way its animals are treated
4835391 until we establish a felt sense of kinship between our own species and those fellow mortals who share with us the sun and shadow of life on this agonized planet there is no hope for other species there is no hope for the environment and there is no hope for ourselves
4835392 if by some miracle in all our struggle the earth is spared from nuclear holocaust only justice to every living thing will save humankind
4835393 all the arguments to prove mans superiority cannot shatter this hard fact in suffering the animals are our equals
4835394 it is the fate of every truth to be an object of ridicule when it is first acclaimed
4835395 the case for animal rights depends only on the need for sentiency
4835396 in the relations of humans with the animals with the flowers with all the objects of creation there is a whole great ethic scarcely seen as yet
4835397 the question is not can they reason nor can they talk but can they suffer
4835398 the time will come when people such as i will look upon the murder of other animals as they no look upon the murder of human beings
4835399 and god said behold i have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat
4835400 there is no religion without love and people may talk as much as they like about their religion but if it does not teach them to be good and kind to other animals as well as humans it is all a sham
4835401 the worst sin toward our fellow creatures is not to hate them but to be indifferent to them that is the essence of inhumanity

4835411 elvis was a hero to most but he never meant shit to me you see straight up racist that sucker was simple and plain mother fuck him and john wayne cause im black and im proud
4835412 lately it has seemed that you are upset with me for some reason this has puzzled me since i have nothing but respect for you i could not recall anything that i may have said to offend you but of course if i did anything wrong towards you i apologize since my conduct toward you in the context of our interactions has been nothing short of cordial i could see no other reason for your current attitude toward me other than the one that i now posit it appears that you may have read a short story of mine which appeared in r magazine to which you likely subscribe in this story there is a character who bears your first name the character in question is a crude and abrasive man whom the narrator does not hold in very high esteem in fact the protagonist in the story has very harsh words to say against the character who bears your name and is in no small way judgmental towards him the character in short bears no similarity to you whatsoever the fact that he shares your name is a mere coincidence
4835413 r is a common first name and my choosing it for this particular character was a whim pure chance it surprises me that you would be offended by the characterization since i find no similarity at all between your personality and that of the character in the story and thats all he is a character in a story a work of fiction there is no reason at all to think that it is in any way an attempt on my part to pass judgment upon you personally if anyone has a reason to be offended by the story it is me as the author the voice of the protagonist is immediately assumed to be my own and reading the story again i find that he is a pathetic miserable excuse for a man by all rights i should be upset by the characterization but then again i recognize it for what it is a work of fiction its not something that i take seriously and neither should you
4835414 part of growing up is learning to tell the difference between what is real and what is imagined we all create myths for ourselves our own fiction sometimes we allow these myths to take the place of our own reality we allow our egos to manufacture the sort of world that we would like to live in we place this ideal world over the real one that wed prefer not to think about in this ideal world we know exactly what everyone thinks about us and there is no need to pretend that we really dont care what they think because we really dont in this world uncertainty becomes certainty self consciousness becomes confidence humility becomes pride in this world of self deception there is no need to wonder inquiry is knowledge and the self deceived are truly wise

4835459 their aim is nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of first the individual country and then the economy of the world as a whole the system was to be controlled in a feudalistic fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences

4835548 spain is a very good team they played well but we are a different style and i think we can win against spain why not im very confident in my team
4835549 when i started working with the players they were a bit scared and afraid
4835550 but after that a lot of players have played better
4835551 it was not fear about me it was just very soon after failing to qualify for euro 2008 and for the players it was like an examination or a test now it is different
4835552 i know what these players can do when playing with their clubs there is no losing mentality there is a winning mentality we have to transfer the same mentality to the national team to play with the same confidence

4835576 despite significant drug and asset seizures and drug related convictions in recent years drug markets have proven to be extremely resilient they are highly fluid and adapt effectively to government and law enforcement interventions
4835577 while the availability of controlled drugs is restricted by definition it appears that additional enforcement efforts have had little adverse effect on the availability of illicit drugs in the uk
4835578 this is nothing new weve known that prohibition measures havent worked for 20 years but the situation is actually worse than the report suggests it is the measures of prohibition that have caused drugs problems and pushed the trade into the hands of organised crime and street corner dealers
4835579 this is a pity as it is very difficult to show that increasing drug seizures actually leads to less drug related harm
4835580 of course drug dealers must be brought to justice but we should recognise and encourage the wider role that the police and other law enforcement officials can play in reducing the impact of drug markets on our communities

4835590 its been frighteningly fast but up there with all of it that has got to be one of the all time great swims its such a magnificent record and to take it down by so much is incredible she just destroyed it
4835591 the record has always been a goal of mine but i never expected it at this moment in time its always been in the back of my mind and to do it now and to break it by that much hasnt quite sunk in yet
4835592 i knew i had to go out fast and be ahead and try to work off that lead
4835593 after the first 400 i thought gosh im only halfway through ive got another one of them to go
4835594 i just said to myself put your head down and go when i got to 500 or 600 i started to think oh my gosh its not over yet it just hit me how fast i had gone out there i was tired but i just had to keep with it
4835595 they were so pleased they were crying their eyes out
4835596 i was saying to them dont cry its a good thing this is a happy day
4835597 some swimmers have physical talent but shes got a psychological talent as well
4835598 the support ive had from my immediate family including harry jamie redknapp and mark redknapp has been unbelievable
4835599 i have been lucky throughout my career with the managers ive had to have a manager who is my uncle was even luckier
4835600 when i spoke to him about my situation and when he spoke to my dad i knew that he was very happy with the outcome of my negotiations even though ive scored against him a few times
4835601 when you put it in context and realise exactly where they were when he got there and you look where they are now and see the players they portsmouth have man for man then i think it is amazing
4835602 my dad can take 80 per cent of the credit for what ive achieved in football
4835603 even now he is the one who criticises me most if i have a bad game we have had more pressing things to deal with recently in our personal lives so it has not been easy to think with a clear mind he is happy that i am here in london and around my sisters
4835604 the letters i have received have been overwhelming thousands have been sent to the training ground from chelsea fans people sent me poems from ireland its important that i say i had lots of correspondence from liverpool manchester united and west ham fans
4835605 that was a breath of fresh air for me because sometimes football can make you cynical and you forget about the things that matter when i get a letter from a west ham fan sending their condolences it makes you realise the important things
4835606 if the queen is watching this girl should be made a dame dame rebecca adlington two olympic golds is awesome shes my best mate so im allowed to say that
4835607 im the proudest mother in beijing although michael phelpss mum must be pretty proud
4835608 the last 20 meters were unbelievable it was that close
4835609 the pressure and all id say this win matched our gold in the 400m freestyle relay
4835610 este bine c pi urc a anun at de acum c va renun a la na ional n 2010
4835611 its really nice to go back as i have such fond memories of my time there i still have friends there but on the pitch ill try and play a good game a lot of teams have got stronger and its true that weve also evolved weve been getting better and every time people expect more of us
4835612 when i was at west ham i sometimes watched tapes about getting in behind the last defender
4835613 but i think since getting in europe maybe i can adapt and come short which i did a few times for england when i first got in the squad dropping in similar to what tevez does for manchester united
4835614 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering in the united states fusing the deadly genome of the 1918 pandemic misnamed the spanish flu with the dna of the innocuous h5n1 virus in a growth medium of human kidney cells according to the national institutes of health and the vaccines manufacturer
4835615 a basic virological fact that the public has not been told is that it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist
4835616 you wouldnt go out to the movies you wouldnt congregate with people
4835617 youd pretty much be staying home with the doors and windows battened down
4835618 for the first year we were talking about its coming and last year the topic was its full blown were in the middle of a pandemic and this year were talking about its over were starting to recover

4835630 even with your gun you cant make me do my homework
4835631 england is something i want to be part of with a new world cup campaign coming up
4835632 its a good place to be playing for your country ive managed to do it in the past and to be involved again would be great i think my game is suited to international football ive played a few games for england and done ok ive had a taste of it and i want more so well see
4835633 you have to judge it on the size of the games you are playing
4835634 i know him very well and saw lots of his games last season he is a very good player and it is possible we have to wait until the next game because after the games it is possible there will be injuries and we have to decide then
4835635 as a player you do what you can and look after what you can control i was playing well and being successful at united so that was my main concern this season could be a fresh start to press my claims im just trying to get fitter and look forward to the start of the season whatever comes after that is a bonus
4835636 you just have to put down a little more time than the next guy

4835657 do you ever look around turn your ear to the ground show your face to the sky on a night when the skies echoe sounds from inside of your mind on the stage that you shone where the sun did become you and move with your thoughts through the sighs and the scenes of the worlds you have seen and the sights that have been your reflection in shadows and dreams your reflection in shadows and dreams did you ever see a man who did walk down the street white robe with no shoes on his feet and on top of his head place a box with two slits and the sign from his neck said i do not exist or a woman who could not remember her name did stutter and stutter again and again and saw you and called you her son her eyes said my being is gone but still im not dead miserere have you ever seen a sound have you listened to an image have you ever touched a thought have you ever tasted nothing have you ever told a lie that was true more than truth because truth it had lied all its life when it spoke to you and what did it say it is that it is this this goes here here is there it is not yes it is it was dulling your senses your eyes they were bound have you ever my friends been looking around and the other replies with a wave of a hand i am already here in this promised land but not by a god and not by a king and not by a spirit deep from within i am here because a miracles a whim its a flash of glory its an empty tin and maybe might lets you in not to save you but to keep on looking miserere have you ever been so happy that youre sad that the lights turn to stars and the stars become eyes and hellos are goodbyes and the laughs are the sighs and the show disappears with the note until next time long live living if living can be this long live living if living can be this long live living if living can be this long live living if living can be this do you ever look around turn your ear to the ground show your face to the sky on a night when the skies echoe sounds from inside of your mind on the stage that you shone where the sun did become you and move with your thoughts through the sighs and the scenes of the worlds you have seen and the sights that have been your reflection in shadows and dreams do you ever look around and find what is yet to be found
4835658 the conditions were especially difficult today but my bike was well prepared and stuck to the track well
4835659 i posted the best time at the start of the session
4835660 after that the conditions got worse and i didnt want to take any risks
4835661 it was nothing im happy with my result in pretty difficult conditions
4835662 i liked our defense forcing the number of turnovers we did was the most satisfying for me
4835663 i was really proud of the way we came into the game focused from the beginning to the end and on both ends of the court
4835664 the key today was our defence and yao ming inside everyone needs a player like him hes a team leader
4835665 it was very difficult for us difficult psychologically but it was good to play at home as we knew we could not lose this game
4835666 i dont think we were sharp enough to finish what we created
4835667 i also believe that with everyone fit we can create more clear cut chances
4835668 i am confident in us i know we are not making headlines with big names but it is what we produce on the pitch which is important
4835669 for the moment berbatov is a spurs player we are happy with him he is part of the spurs squad and there is nothing to say about it
4835670 we have won at everton and not many teams do that apart from the top four it was a great achievement
4835671 i came here just to win and i did just that i didnt even know id broken the world record until i did my victory lap
4835672 now im just concentrating on my two races coming up i came here prepared and im going to try and do it the 100 and 200m double
4835673 im just happy i wanted to please myself and i did that
4835674 i didnt come here to set the world record because i am the holder i came here to win
4835675 i hope to win three gold medals the 200 plus the relay i am happy to make the country proud and to do it again for them in the 200m
4835676 the celebration it wasnt planned i was just celebrating i was pretty happy
4835677 i dont care about the rumours hes been tested over and over again
4835678 i say to them to come down come down and see our programme come down and see our testing and see how we operate come down anytime day or night we have nothing to hide
4835679 he is the best ever sprinter and ive said that before
4835680 he has run 9 69 and got the gold so he is definitely the greatest it was a spectacular performance and he was definitely the best here he could have run faster if he had run straight through the line
4835681 i was feeling good but i didnt feel it in my legs they died on me
4835682 it feels good to be here to be part of history
4835683 it was good to finish behind him bolt because theres no way anyone on earth could have beaten him tonight
4835684 to finish second to him that is a great accomplishment in itself usain is a great athlete it was just a matter of time before he proved himself on this stage
4835685 i cant be more satisfied with third place he bolt broke the world record you cant ask for more
4835686 everyone could see what he did he didnt even push through the line its an amazing time
4835687 weve still go a small chance of winning the competition
4835688 weve got two big weeks in front of us and want to go out and make the nation proud all we can do is focus on the things weve got control over and thats the two games in front of us
4835689 they showed good fitness levels at the end and tackled well throughout the game were still in the hunt and today was certainly a step in the right direction
4835690 its the moment you dream of being in even though there is so much pressure to it
4835691 but its exactly where you want to find yourself facing the pressure and doing it we played fantastic so its a dream come true its almost disbelief to some degree
4835692 to win any medal in the olympics is a huge achievement for any athlete not many athletes get a chance to win a medal
4835693 but for me this bronze shines like a gold because i think ive played pretty good tennis all the tournament
4835694 hes not 100 per cent hes not been feeling good
4835695 but hes grant hackett and hes raced through these things before
4835696 he was upset and worried but hes glad im with my mum and dad
4835697 i said forget about me and think about yourself think about the race and stay relaxed
4835698 it was a slippery soapy shower and i fell over
4835699 it the cut was gushing but fortunately my parents were just on their way up from downstairs when it happened
4835700 my head is sore and im bruised but its ok theyve put a clip in it at the back of my skull
4835701 hes hoping for the best and hes going to give it his best shot
4835702 i just tell him i love him and good luck and he says im thinking of you all the time

4835711 now russia needs to honour the agreement and withdraw its forces
4835712 georgia is a member of the united nations and south ossetia and abkhazia lie within its internationally recognised borders
4835713 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4835714 the czech game is an important game because i hope to get the answers from the players that i expect
4835715 i have confidence in these players confidence because ive seen the steps weve taken in four friendly matches
4835716 i saw the euros and the other teams and i think we are a very good team i think we will win
4835717 the other managers before me is not important this is my idea and my opinion i know the players very well now
4835718 i have a theory about new words and ideas it seems that very often as soon as i have learned something a word an historical figure a theorem that it pops up again within weeks almost like it was lying there just waiting to be noticed ill go my whole life without having heard of some persian philosopher and the week after i learn about him hell be referenced in next weeks new yorker or quoted on some cd liner notes the phenomenon badly wants a name but i am unsure what to call it it is sort of like reverse d j vu with a bit of kismet thrown in for the time being i call it s a for serendipitous awareness
4835719 even the patience of the brothers was being tested by our slow internet
4835720 president medvedev informed members of the security council of the russian federation that he had signed the document on principles
4835721 ask the russians they are not following the agreement what do they want here
4835722 i want to go to gori ive left my family there i am bringing food for them but they wont let me pass
4835723 im from tbilisi i was here working when the war broke out i was taken in
4835724 im horrified i dont know if its russians or mercenaries doing it
4835725 we are constantly encountering various problems with the georgian side and it will depend how quickly and effectively this problem will be solved
4835726 now russia needs to honour the agreement and withdraw its forces
4835727 extricate the masses of the people from the dire straits in which they find themselves
4835728 this summit affords us the possibility to assist the zimbabwean parties to finalise their negotiations so that together they can engage the work to achieve national healing and reconciliation
4835729 we agreed at the security organ that the agreement should be signed within the period of the summit
4835730 we had 28 turnovers and thats just a staggering number
4835731 you just dont have a chance with that many turnovers
4835732 they were moving out too many people at one time so i guess they got mad and they started fighting outside
4835733 there were 10 arrests total for the evening some of those occurred inside the gate some occurred outside we had ten injuries during the course of the evening that resulted from the fights seven of the ten were fairgoers and three were police officers
4835734 the police started screaming at the people who were fighting and all of a sudden i just saw a big wave of people running around everywhere
4835735 i didnt see a riot it was just people running is all it was as a result of what they thought was fearing for their safety
4835736 there were kids there were adults and cats and dogs and so forth and everybody managed to get out safely
4835737 we did have a shootout and an assault and everything right around us at the same time the police were trying to deal with while we were trying to get in here at the same time so we had a lot of people standing around and a lot of police we had to work around
4835738 nrdc is backdooring the limitation by accepting internet comments here which they will print and deliver to the fish and wildlife service
4835739 this 11th hour ruling from the bush administration is highly problematic after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it
4835740 as president senator obama will fight to maintain the strong protections of the endangered species act and undo this proposal from president bush
4835741 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4835742 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4835743 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4835744 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4835745 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4835746 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4835747 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4835748 i do not want to keep saying this but nobody is going to be leaving the club
4835749 we want to keep our best players be it santa cruz warnock or mccarthy and any one of a dozen players
4835750 lets dispel all this no one is leaving the club we have had a really good start in this game
4835751 we have won at everton and not many teams do that apart from the top four it was a great achievement
4835752 id love to give him a full sibling but i just couldnt do it its so unfortunate

4835756 this is an extension of a technology thats been around in the server world for several years
4835757 on servers you have something thats called a service processor thats always awake and can do things like monitor the system do reboots and run diagnostics youd have complete remote access to your home pc you could do that now but the computer has to be turned on all the time and sleep mode can interfere with remote operations
4835758 this technological collaboration enables users to reduce wasted energy while still being able to conveniently access all their files even when on the go
4835759 think of when you can for instance tell your home computer to boot up email you a file at work and then turn itself off with this someday you could turn your computer on remotely turn it off remotely reboot it anything you like you also could schedule things to happen unattended
4835760 london 2012 here i come its going to be fantastic i wouldnt miss it for the whole world
4835761 standing up and being sick because i was more nervous than ive ever been in my life
4835762 its an awesome achievement its frighteningly fast and rebeccas performance is right up there with all the best swims thats got to be one of the all time great swims
4835763 its such a magnificent record and to take it down by so much the other girls couldnt repeat couldnt back up on their heats swims she just destroyed the record and destroyed the field
4835764 it would be an honour of course but thats not why i came here i came here to do a job to race for what ive worked for it wasnt about anything that might go with it
4835765 im delighted that the records i held for being the last british woman to are finally gone and they could not have gone to a more lovely or deserving athlete
4835766 i cant believe it i went out so quick its fantastic that all the hard work over the years has paid off
4835767 mrs phelps must be pretty proud too but we are just overjoyed its just unbelievable
4835768 to be honest anything that has come in is going to have to come second to swimming no matter what it is my swimming comes first im still going to have to go training between six and eight in the morning and five and seven at night i couldnt have done it without my mum and dad and bills been like a second dad if it hadnt been for him i wouldnt be here today
4835769 others would have walked away but bill stuck by me
4835770 when she turned in two mins zero one at the 200m i was standing with the other coaches and they said thats a bit fast i said its not because she just looks so easy she has an awesome technique everyone talks about the work that swimmers do and we do have a punishing regime but we do as much work on technique the thing that makes the difference is technique the thing that wins it is technique
4835771 when you work with someone day in and day out you see some amazing things and sometimes its difficult to keep your mouth shut because its just amazing
4835772 she swims four of five sessions a week at world class pace people have been asking me if im surprised yes im surprised but part of me is not

4835777 its perhaps the most depressing fact of this campaign so far that the first major encounter between mccain and obama will be presided over by a mega pastor and in a church
4835778 if you havent done anything wrong you dont have anything to worry about
4835779 he thinks theyre thugs he thinks theyre hooligans in fact theres some evidence that hes trying to pick fights with them hoping that they will start a fight that he can then turn around and finish them
4835780 mccain is too old to serve eight years but might just avoid total senility if he served four
4835781 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4835782 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4835783 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4835784 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4835785 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4835786 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4835787 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4835788 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4835789 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

4835791 lets put it this way your graphics pros your render wranglers they just got their headroom doubled
4835792 i told you all i was going to be no 1 and i did just that
4835793 when i saw i wasnt covered i was just happy
4835794 toward the finish line i couldnt tell if i made it to the finals or not
4835795 i looked up there and realized i didnt it was kind of devastating i may have needed more races but i dont really have any excuses i just didnt make it
4835796 im pretty upset when i get back to the village its really probably going to set in my family is here everyone at home is supporting me and i just feel i let them down a little bit but at the same time i did my best and everyone knows i did
4835797 we have been screwing up the ocean with plastic for 50 to 60 years the fact that weve done it so fast and that it has penetrated so low into the food chain is alarming but were just beginning to make a scientific assessment of what this means
4835798 this issue is so important and so relevant and so underreported
4835799 canary in the coal mine people should be concerned about the degradation of the aquatic system because if it goes life as we know it is going to go
4835800 mouse fish rat or human the mechanisms developed over hundreds of millions of years of evolution and are extremely similar across all vertebrates if they can be harmed so can we
4835801 negligible concern that exposure of pregnant women to bisphenol a will result in fetal or neonatal mortality birth defects or reduced birth weight and growth in their offspring
4835802 at exposure levels far in excess of those experienced by humans
4835803 this is 1 000 times higher than the ability of the cells to respond to this chemical there is clearly no safe amount
4835804 you dont have to have a phd or be a physician to know that estrogenizing males and blocking testosterone is going to wreak havoc
4835805 the ocean really needs us to embody a zero waste culture on land
4835806 thats the only way she is going to heal herself
4835807 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4835808 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4835809 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4835810 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4835811 social engineering seems just as effective as it was 10 years ago
4835812 ensuring inviolate areas for the big cats as well as for other wildlife
4835813 this will help decrease man animals conflict and create inviolate zones for tigers
4835814 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4835815 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
4835816 is deliberately misrepresenting the facts about our plan in order to shift attention away from the democrats shameful record
4835817 her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
4835818 au regard de la signification et du symbolisme que rev tent ces jeux qui se pr sentent comme une occasion unique o le monde partage r ellement un v nement global en portant haut les id aux de civilisation les plus nobles jusqu pr sent notre plan te nincarne pas un seul et unique monde partageant un r ve

4835821 maybe it comes around once in a lifetime its almost disbelief to some degree
4835822 hopefully ill be able to show people a new one
4835823 obviously we would have loved to have brought home more medals for the u s
4835824 we did the best we could were not asking for more at this point next time well ask for a little more
4835825 im sure all the fans in russia will be very happy about it
4835826 we were obviously disappointed that we couldnt make the gold medal match but its going to be something really special to us to have that medal back at home
4835827 to win any medal in the olympics is a huge achievement
4835828 not many of the athletes get a chance to win a medal
4835829 i have to take something positive from the way i was playing this week
4835830 thats what i expected and hoped for many years ago when i got to no 1 that if ever somebody were to take it away from me he would have to play an incredible tennis schedule win the biggest tournaments dominate the game basically i think rafa totally deserves it
4835831 its not the first time this tournament or in my life i had to serve for a big match
4835832 its basically the moment you dream of being in even though there is so much pressure to it
4835833 i didnt sleep enough im just really happy that i could put all my energy into the match and pull out the match
4835834 ganhar o boys championship provavelmente a maior competi o de sub 18 do mundo espantoso foi um grande match fraser um ptima pessoa e ambos jog mos bem
4835835 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

4835837 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4835838 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4835839 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4835840 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4835841 assinamos o primeiro compromisso para fornecer ao paraguai todo o petr leo necess rio at a ltima gota

4835843 we will meet with the representatives of chevron texaco who are asking for a meeting but with our colleagues of the amazon defense front the plaintiffs lawyers present
4835844 be confident that you have a patriotic and sovereign government that will never again bow to the interests of the big transnational companies
4835845 our position hasnt changed we are open to a meeting that could provide a solution
4835846 but if we sit down the government needs to discuss its unfulfilled contractual obligations
4835847 we are committed to a resolution that includes a comprehensive remediation of the environmental harm caused by texaco and for that to happen the ecuadorean court needs to be allowed to finish the case
4835848 i want to apologise for the disruption and difficulty this issue may have caused to our customers and our partners
4835849 we failed in not disabling the code in the final release of update 2 and not catching it in our quality assurance process
4835850 we have kicked off a comprehensive in depth review of our qa and release processes and will quickly make the needed changes
4835851 i updated one of my five hosts and everything appears to be fine so far
4835852 thanks for all the hard work getting this patch out
4835853 unfortunately i think youve gotten a serious black eye today we were finally getting management happy with the idea of using esx for production servers and this set us back a little bit
4835854 as a vmware enterprise partner and vmware authorised consultant i can tell you this is a big deal for vmware to release a product that has such grave consequences for even a relatively small portion of the total vmware user population
4835855 this could have been prevented by not rushing an update to market which was intended to be free and compete with microsofts hyper v vmware ran face first into the very hurdle it was trying to clear
4835856 this will cast doubt about the reliability of vmware in the enterprise
4835857 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4835858 they can use their overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor
4835859 i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that russia ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system
4835860 so from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word

4835873 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4835874 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4835875 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4835876 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4835877 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4835878 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4835879 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4835880 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4835881 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis

4835886 today there is a strong evangelical center emerging that agrees that a biblically balanced agenda has to include pro life pro family pro poor pro racial justice pro creation care and pro peace making
4835887 the centrists are those of us who dont engage in armchair armageddonism
4835888 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness

4835903 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4835904 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4835905 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4835906 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4835907 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4835908 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4835909 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4835910 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4835911 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

4835924 if there is anything such as the lula chavez continuum

4835926 bolivar didnt use it but we will against corruption and crime
4835927 whatever you think of our policy whether its right or wrong if you look at what our troops are doing going out on patrol every single day in the knowledge they will be attacked possibly killed you cant help but admire them
4835928 no matter how many heads you cut off the monster grows another one
4835929 i dont think the west should pull out of afghanistan but we need to change strategy i think we need to learn to live with the taleban and find another way other than military to move forward
4835930 the great plan to democratise the country is seen as the icing on the cake but to do it by military means is pure folly
4835931 how many british troops have to die for womens rights in afghanistan the answer is none its not our business
4835932 whatever you think of our policy whether its right or wrong if you look at what our troops are doing going out on patrol every single day in the knowledge they will be attacked possibly killed you cant help but admire them

4835936 i think i heard less dynamic control in the voice of the second one
4835937 you get this feeling shes a little angrier about this breakup and a little later in the aria she has the wonderful line addio senza rancor farewell with no hard feelings shes a little more sarcastic yet very real
4835938 netrebko sounded a little more vulnerable a little breathier were reminded that mimi is very ill in this story and you can hear that so what we have going on here are two entirely different stories thats why we have two different recordings
4835939 perhaps because they can get away with it because they are bigger names
4835940 anna netrebko and rolando villaz n are doing more acting with their voices and they are taking more chances what you have with haddock and amsellem is just the gush of singing and that works too
4835941 is the glory of boh me it always works no matter what you could put mickey and minnie mouse out there and someone will be crying in the audience ive heard it in barns with two pianos and a tenor sounding like a tomcat in the moonlight and it still gets you choked up thats also the reason why its done so often it always works
4835942 its not about great people making important decisions its about the most inconsequential people you can imagine the urban poor and the little details in their lives
4835943 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4835944 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4835945 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4835946 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4835947 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4835948 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4835949 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4835950 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4835951 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4835952 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4835953 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4835954 who are open to doing something on the production side
4835955 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4835956 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4835957 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4835958 it wasnt an overdose i had a bad experience it was nowhere near an overdose it was blown completely out of proportion i never overdosed
4835959 drugs for me are something i dont normally meddle in i have tried drugs in my life im not going to deny it but i dont need to go to rehab because i never and will never have any sort of habit with drugs
4835960 its something that everyone well not everyone smart people usually dont do it but its something that people go through in their lives especially growing up in london and its not something ive ever had a problem with
4835961 plans are very hush hush but madonna is definitely going to celebrate in style
4835962 unfortunately not everything has gone as expected as shes had many other things on her mind not least rehearsals for her sticky and sweet tour on top of all the stress she twisted her ankle over the weekend
4835963 she views this as a sign she should postpone the birthday bash and play it by ear instead
4835964 i love sienna i think shes a wonderful actress but weve been like two passing ships in the night recently
4835965 i think thats lovely but also sad about acting you get incredibly close to people and as soon as its over you dont see each other
4835966 i dont think im very good at figuring out female friendships i think theyre quite tricky to navigate
4835967 mum and i would always talk about sex shed come up to my room have me roll her cigarettes and then tell me id have to have one with her
4835968 its not the typical mother daughter thing but were extremely close

4835972 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
4835973 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with bernies wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
4835974 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the pre eminent comedians of our generation
4835975 my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
4835976 however shes at peace about his transition because of her faith in god her faith is what is sustaining her
4835977 they had 30 years of marriage thats unprecedented in todays time particularly for celebrities that brings joy to her they loved each other and respected each other on a daily basis she was by his side to the very end

4835980 ryder and i ichat with chris constantly no matter what is going on in my life relationship wise chris takes absolute precedence its important for ryder to hear me say how wonderful chris is and how much chris misses him
4835981 every girl wants a fairy tale ending and i believe its possible absolutely
4835982 she hopes balthazar can get rosetta to put out a statement saying their marriage was already over they have already got friends to speak out saying he was sleeping on their sofas
4835983 its nonsense that the marriage was already over when balthazar went away in may rosetta thought it was to see his sick mum in germany but she now knows that it was to cavort with sienna in prague
4835984 i definitely want to do a duet its just about finding the right
4835985 to us thats us as kids and as sisters minus everything else it was nice to share that people think i dont like talking about kylie but that couldnt be further from the truth i understand why people ask about her she is incredibly famous and loved by everyone so people want to know what it is like being her sister thats normal we are really different people so there has never been any competition
4835986 but at the same time i love my career so i would struggle to choose
4835987 emme voi mit n ven l iset tulevat vain l hemm ksi
4835988 i was good in school but i was surprised because i didnt put too much time in studying i was always dreaming about the things i wanted to do when i was older like acting i still dont know why or how i passed because i literally put no time in

4836004 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4836005 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4836006 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4836007 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4836008 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4836009 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4836010 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4836011 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4836012 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4836013 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4836014 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4836015 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4836016 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4836017 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4836018 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4836019 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4836020 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4836021 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4836022 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4836023 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4836024 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4836025 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4836026 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4836027 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4836028 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4836029 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4836030 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4836031 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4836032 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4836033 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4836034 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4836035 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4836036 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4836037 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4836038 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4836039 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4836040 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4836041 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4836042 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4836043 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4836044 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

4836048 kami tak melakukan yang seharusnya yakni mencetak gol sehingga bisa terhindar dari kekalahan liverpool memiliki torres dan steven gerrard yang akan menghukum kamu itulah mengapa premier league sangat keras
4836049 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4836050 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4836051 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4836052 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

4836067 i feel very strongly about farmers in new england i wouldnt have chosen this business if i didnt feel there was this intrinsic part of new england thats just vanishing my family history is in vermont where the dairy farms are being replaced by townhouses
4836068 places lose their personality when they modernize and homogenize i dont want that to happen for new england theres a strong contingent that wish it wasnt like that everywhere and those are the folks im trying to appeal to
4836069 ive talked with a lot of farmers over the past year or so and by and large their feelings about whole foods condense down to this type of a statement they dont really want to buy enough from me for their customers to regularly buy my products they want to buy enough from me so they can hang a buy local sign with the name of my farm in their produce section
4836070 as hard as they may try i just dont think it is possible for a publicly traded company of their size to do what they want us to think they do they need better profit margins they need to buy cheap stuff and mark it way up at their size this means the buy local part of their business plan is more branding than buying
4836071 im all for farmers markets but theres a huge group of people who dont get the food and theyre the people with the paychecks

4836075 i will talk to our investigators and our legal advisers and see what we need to do
4836076 select from the numerous web blog and news sites listed here go there and make your opinions supporting john mccain known
4836077 once youve commented on a post video or news story report the details of your comment by clicking the button below
4836078 fast forward almost a year and the mccain campaign has begun to implement some of the same tactics
4836079 i think it shows the campaign is willing to play with the technology and enable their supporters to participate in that flurry of web activity a little supporter participation can go a long way towards feeding energy into a campaign
4836080 in this case the prize will go to the campaign that uses technology most effectively to turn voters out on election day
4836081 all the cool widgets and gadgets and gimmicks in the world cant help you if they dont feed into that mission
4836082 therefore with the growth of technology the human race is faced with tremendous crisis
4836083 so the kind of thought thats going on all around us begins to take over in every one of us without our even knowing it

4836086 we think weekends are meant to be special so at enterprise weve made our weekend rates special its another way we pick you up
4836087 our special weekend rates make it easy for cost conscious motorists to enjoy the security comfort and reliability of newer model enterprise rental cars for the weekend saving wear and tear and mileage on their own vehicles
4836088 while the cost of gasoline has caused some customers to request fuel efficient rental cars demand has also remained steady for larger vehicles
4836089 we know how to change behavior and attitudes that is what we do
4836090 we know what messages will work and what will not
4836091 people know outside is going to feel much better for them but underpredict how happy theyre going to feel after being outside in nature even 15 minutes
4836092 the people inside overestimate their happiness about being inside its this error in judgment people have about how happy they are in a different environment that may explain why people dont spend more time in nature
4836093 rather than changing their ways to protect the environment the results of this study suggest that these people may give up on their efforts to protect the environment
4836094 i think most people recognize we face a severe environmental crisis but its hard to deal with that head on because most people feel helpless to do anything about it
4836095 if we look at the nature of the problem it is so big its hard to know what any individual can do in their own life to make a difference
4836096 the tendency when people are confronted with an overwhelming problem is to run away from it so psychologists are very experienced in dealing with that
4836097 one of the first things you think of is turning off lights when you leave a room or changing the thermostat settings in the house they dont think first of caulking windows or upgrading your furnace
4836098 more insulation in the attic and tight windows make more difference than changing the thermostat setting having a more fuel efficient car makes more difference than any amount youre likely to decrease driving

4836141 maybe it comes around once in a lifetime its almost disbelief to some degree
4836142 hopefully ill be able to show people a new one
4836143 obviously we would have loved to have brought home more medals for the u s
4836144 we did the best we could were not asking for more at this point next time well ask for a little more
4836145 im sure all the fans in russia will be very happy about it
4836146 we were obviously disappointed that we couldnt make the gold medal match but its going to be something really special to us to have that medal back at home
4836147 to win any medal in the olympics is a huge achievement
4836148 not many of the athletes get a chance to win a medal
4836149 i have to take something positive from the way i was playing this week
4836150 thats what i expected and hoped for many years ago when i got to no 1 that if ever somebody were to take it away from me he would have to play an incredible tennis schedule win the biggest tournaments dominate the game basically i think rafa totally deserves it
4836151 its not the first time this tournament or in my life i had to serve for a big match
4836152 its basically the moment you dream of being in even though there is so much pressure to it
4836153 i didnt sleep enough im just really happy that i could put all my energy into the match and pull out the match
4836154 while you all may be taking a stance similar to 15 year old girls who get called ugly in the gym i am not
4836155 im certain that the millions of zimbabweans both inside and outside the country await with great expectations and high hopes a positive outcome from our deliberations
4836156 and there is no doubt that there is a serious blot on the culture of democracy in our sub region
4836157 this group has not sought widespread recognition for its many successes it may be the best school youve never heard of
4836158 graduates of mercy montessori have a stellar record of achievement and success and the work both the students and the staff perform is humbling and inspirational and we are honored to have been selected to share this positive message
4836159 mercy montessori is genuinely a wonderful school and one of the very best private schools of any kind
4836160 we have such a chain of successes and we believe that its valuable for our school and our parents to share these stories of inspiration the emg team was incredibly enthusiastic and their expertise in public relations is well known
4836161 he can be called the best olympian of all time
4836162 not because he has more gold medals than anybody but in the way hes handled himself and in the way hes actually won under a tremendous amount of pressure
4836163 i personally looked at the video footage and it was very clear the serbian swimmer touched second
4836164 it was my last individual race and i just wanted to finish as strong as i could

4836448 you look at bentleys riding by and lust in that same way ooh the shape ooh the custom paint id slave away for a year to be able to pimp that and while the owner might love his new comfy wheels to him it might just be his whip his level of appreciation for things is surely heightened it might take things more luxurious than that to get him off its all a matter of perspective
4836449 here is what i have in store for demo 5
4836450 como lo especifiqu en nuestra conferencia de prensa conjunta en tiflis estas medidas de seguridad adicionales s lo se pueden implementar en la proximidad inmediata a osetia del sur excluyendo cualquier otra parte del territorio georgiano
4836451 m s espec ficamente estas medidas s lo podr n ser implementadas dentro de una zona de pocos kil metros alrededor de los l mites administrativos entre osetia del sur y el resto de georgia de manera que no se incluya ning n centro urbano importante me refiero particularmente a la ciudad de gori
4836452 habr que definir acuerdos especiales para garantizar la libertad de movimiento en las rutas terrestres y ferroviarias de georgia
4836453 it may not be as tense as the nuclear standoff with the soviet union for now but it could become as strained
4836454 the soviet unions disappearance was the worst geographical disaster of the 20th century

4836475 since there was no evidence against bashar we couldnt include his name in chargesheet but we were hot on his trail
4836476 at first we found little evidence that a terror training camp had been conducted there but we went back with sniffer dogs and metal detectors the dogs found the spot
4836477 the dogs sniffed this place just outside the farmhouse which was dug out we found 122 super explosive gelatine sticks 100 detonators and switch boards in plastic bags
4836478 the transformation has taken a decade or so of hawala or blood money

4836484 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
4836485 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
4836486 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
4836487 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
4836488 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
4836489 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
4836490 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
4836491 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
4836492 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
4836493 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
4836494 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
4836495 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
4836496 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
4836497 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
4836498 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
4836499 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4836500 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4836501 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4836502 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4836503 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4836504 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4836505 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4836506 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4836507 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4836508 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4836509 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4836510 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4836511 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4836512 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4836513 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4836514 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4836515 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4836516 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4836517 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
4836518 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
4836519 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
4836520 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
4836521 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
4836522 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
4836523 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
4836524 at least three upa members support simi while a fourth the pdp talks of marching to muzzaffarabad in pok
4836525 we always looked in control and i thought the second goal would come but west brom defended very well and and we lacked a bit of sharpness around the box
4836526 we didnt get off to a great start we had one or two opportunities compared to their 15 or 20 but we go away believing we can compete in this league if we work as hard as we did today we have got a chance
4836527 we were on top in the second half and controlled the game we had chances and torres took his he is a key player who can change games
4836528 we took the game to fulham we did not sit back
4836529 there is a lot of excitement in the city that we are here for the first time and weve got something to build on
4836530 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4836531 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4836532 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4836533 dette er et d rligt event selv arrang ren kommer ikke s lad v re med at kom
4836534 it was a very positive meeting people voiced a strong stand against anti semitism which president ch vez supported
4836535 this dizzy life of mine is hanging me up all the time
4836536 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4836537 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4836538 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4836539 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4836540 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4836541 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4836542 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4836543 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4836544 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4836545 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4836546 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4836547 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4836548 it was a very positive meeting people voiced a strong stand against anti semitism which president ch vez supported
4836549 i want to wear it all the time but i dont want to look like an idiot
4836550 postrados en el suelo desnudos simulando estar ensangrentados y con banderillas clavadas en sus espaldas
4836551 llamar la atenci n sobre el sufrimiento y muerte inflingidos a los animales en las fiestas populares
4836552 jag ska aldrig igen uttala mig om att brottare r barnsliga
4836553 verraskningen jag kokade ihop i f rra veckan v ntar p sitt avsl jande
4836554 ibland blir inte allt som man har t nkt sig
4836555 no son pensadores de izquierda las farc son unos matones unos terroristas mira el atentado que cometieron en ituango colombia donde uno de ellos hizo explotar tres kilos de explosivos y caus la muerte de siete personas tres a punto de morir y m s de 80 heridos
4836556 todas estas actividades son cosas que vamos a tener que revisar ahora y decir bueno qu deber amos estar haciendo y si deber amos hacer algo para demostrar que no puede haber relaciones como es habitual con rusia
4836557 georgia va a resurgir de esto y ser reconstruida recuperar su lugar como una econom a destacada
4836558 no queremos una din mica negativa en las relaciones de la otan con rusia queremos que sea positiva pero para que eso ocurra rusia tiene que retirarse de georgia respetar la soberan a de georgia y su integridad territorial y jugar con las reglas del siglo xxi
4836559 georgia va a resurgir de esto y ser reconstruida recuperar su lugar como una econom a destacada
4836560 y as lo que los rusos habr n logrado es que habr n demostrado que pueden utilizar su abrumador poder militar regional para dar una paliza a un peque o vecino
4836561 while i was nervous at first it was great to get involved in a campaign that will get our country back on the right track
4836562 young people cannot afford to be spectators in this critical election and must get involved in order to bring about change
4836563 my view is that im there to make sure that the meeting runs well and fairly and that the vote is taken fairly and not to weigh in for or against a particular candidate
4836564 i do it because by law im required to do it its not something i chose to do
4836565 i have been able to arrive at a level where im comfortable on this
4836566 they were sending a statement we are for real and they sent it loud and clear
4836567 they wanted to show everyone they are superior and they did
4836568 the greek game we thought we were going to be tested
4836569 the spain game we thought we were going to be tested we still have teams on the other side we havent played yet
4836570 i guess you could say americans havent played defense for the last eight years
4836571 look at 2004 look at 2006 our defensive intensity wasnt high now with the maturity of these guys they understand what it takes
4836572 what makes this team a little special right now is that watching us on tape is one thing but when you have the speed factor up close its a whole different ball game
4836573 that comes from defense and our transition game look at the guys on the floor dwyane wade lebron james theyre all pretty fast
4836574 the small things are what win ball games and we got away from that after 2000
4836575 when you look at the rest of the world thats what they do well all the little things pass the ball set screens make the extra pass we got away from that we thought our athletic ability was going to win ball games and that wasnt the case
4836576 basically said youre the publisher and ceo its yours to run and that was pretty much it
4836577 ok so why hartenstein for la times publisher im told its because he understands subscription based product and new media distribution after taking directv from zero to 12 5 million subscribers despite fvery stiff competition from cable
4836578 i remember the look of horror on the teachers face when i came to sit my english o level
4836579 she told me just to sit quietly and not disturb the others
4836580 i felt as if i was jumping without a safety net
4836581 its a miracle if a child like me emerges from education unscathed
4836582 i was thought lazy and stupid i was called silly sally i was bullied and took to stealing buns to make friends for 16 years i was penalised by an education system that considered the things i was good at were inferior
4836583 my parents friends all thought i was bright because i had a huge vocabulary but my teachers thought i must be brain damaged
4836584 words seemed to float they didnt stay on pages they stood up at angles i could make up a story about tuesday but i couldnt spell or read the word tuesday
4836585 while a boy was having a fit i picked up a copy of wuthering heights that was lying around and pretended to be engrossed after a bit i realised that i was reading from then on i couldnt stop
4836586 i just have to accept that two plus two equals four
4836587 i felt the tin can of my dyslexia rattle loudly
4836588 im looking for the words they could be on the floor or the ceiling
4836589 why are we so keen on this circus trick of being able to read and write there is nothing wrong with being dyslexic except to the non dyslexic
4836590 essentially anecdotal but most dyslexic university students do degrees in the arts and architecture
4836591 there is evidence of very high levels of lateral thinking and three dimensional problem solving among dyslexics which means that many become mechanics or technicians
4836592 come on kids were going for the longest walk in the world
4836593 lets keep it in one thread bro okay man have 2 threads about your bios i didnt post an answer cause it was answered in the other thread my machine antec nine hundred case 5x 120mm amp 1x 200mm fans evga 790i ultra xfx p06d bios q9450 3 6 ghz linked sync 1800 mhz zalman cnps9700 led cpu cooler 4096 mb of ocz platinum pc3 12800 8 7 7 22 2t 4 28 10 15 23 7 8us black slots antec tpq 1000 1000 watt power supply dual gtx 260 oc sli setup 725 1484 1242 2484 effective forceware 177 83 x fi fatal1ty sound card creative 5 1 surround sound 2 wd raptors 10 000 rpm 150 gb running raid 0 mad dog ls dvdrw cd dvd drive razer lachesis 4000 dpi mouse razer lycosa gaming keyboard lg flatron wide 22
4836594 but at minimum youll need a 60gb hard drive and original disc in order to pull this off
4836595 the czech game is an important game because i hope to get the answers from the players that i expect
4836596 i have confidence in these players confidence because ive seen the steps weve taken in four friendly matches
4836597 i saw the euros and the other teams and i think we are a very good team i think we will win
4836598 the other managers before me is not important this is my idea and my opinion i know the players very well now
4836599 i think three months ago people never spoke about spain now they are the best team in the a miracle
4836600 spain is a very good team they played well but we are a different style and i think we can win against spain why not im very confident in my team
4836601 when i started working with the players they were a bit scared and afraid
4836602 but after that a lot of players have played better
4836603 it was not fear about me it was just very soon after failing to qualify for euro 2008 and for the players it was like an examination or a test now it is different
4836604 i know what these players can do when playing with their clubs there is no losing mentality there is a winning mentality we have to transfer the same mentality to the national team to play with the same confidence
4836605 i think they know me now my style the movement around the pitch that i want they know and it is better now
4836606 only spains fernando torres is a big striker in this moment in the world
4836607 dedes serious injury has of course put a real dampener on the mood and im finding it hard to talk about the game
4836608 the win came at a high price dedes injury is a major blow and a very bitter one
4836609 when a player wants to leave that is the best solution
4836610 we got the best out of the situation that we could zidan plus some additional cash
4836611 faz parte do of cio de um cientista revelar o que as pessoas n o est o prontas para receber
4836612 toda a nossa pol tica social baseia se no facto da sua intelig ncia dos negros ser a mesma que a nossa mas todas as experi ncias mostram o contr rio
4836613 i didnt come here to run the world record because i am the world record holder he said
4836614 hes a freak of nature said darvis patton one of seven runners who was vying for the silver medal in saturdays final seeing that bolt could have jogged his way to the gold

4836728 given that ecommerce is starting to have a better reputation for customer service than stores we were surprised to see that the business challenges driving retailers strategies today focus more on product related issues
4836729 whats not surprising however is that online pure play e tailers are at the forefront of innovation in online shopping
4836730 it appears that the online market is diverging online pure plays are trying to differentiate themselves from multi channel retailers by offering a larger product assortment and a differentiated customer experience in order to battle the cross channel capabilities that they cant offer
4836731 some multi channel retailers have recognized that cross channel offers a real opportunity to provide a high quality customer experience but others appear to be blindly copying e tailer pure plays in an effort to boost their online presence its a real disadvantage if youre primarily a store based retailer to ignore the advantages that cross channel can give you

4836743 this year the multinational record labels will only release about 40 records by brazilian artists while tecnobrega artists will release around 400
4836744 the record industry argues if intellectual property isnt protected there will be no innovation but tecnobrega has shown thats not true
4836745 piracy in brazil is undermining the ability of the music and film industries to invest in the next generation of local talent lower revenues from current sales mean less money to invest in new artists

4836757 it seems so common that these mia addicts make their holiday appearances dosent it i am amazed every year by the feeble attempts made to convince us that the events of the year were nothing more than our own misconceptions of reality for all of you who are bracing for this contact please know my thoughts and prayers are with you stand fast with knowledge that the boundaries youve set throughout the year truly are healthy ones and that just because its christmas time it does not give someone the right to waltz right in as if nothing has happened its not some kind of god given right to be a part of special times when they have done nothing to earn a place in these times try to keep in mind that its the nature of this beast to try and make us second guess our selves and that giving in only gives strength to this demon that is making its home in our worlds think of your childhood memories of christmas time and know that your decisions now will affect the memories your children and grandchildren carry with them for the rest of their lives

4836761 there is no question that driving without insurance is both unlawful and ill advised
4836762 if you are worried about the cost of insurance it is worth talking to your insurance provider to check whether there are any savings to be made at rias for example we specialise in finding tailored insurance solutions for the over 50s who can often benefit from cheaper premiums because of low mileage or because their cars are parked off road or kept in a garage we advise customers to ensure they ask about discounts and flexible payment plans when they call us for a quote
4836763 they are simply acknowledged it is important for us to check that the documents are authentic and that the husband does not have dutch nationality
4836764 for our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the rulers against the authorities against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms
4836765 never to leave nor forsake us so we can confidently say the lord is my helper
4836766 they are no more defined by the world than i am defined by the world make them holy consecrated with the truth your word is consecrating truth
4836767 for the culture in which we live in jesus name
4836768 it is done i am the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end to him who is thirsty i will give to drink without cost from the spring of the water of life
4836769 christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles through jesus christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith
4836770 and when abram was ninety years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name any more be called abram but thy name shall be abraham for a father of many nations have i made thee and i will make thee exceeding fruitful and i will make nations of thee and kings shall come out of thee and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee
4836771 therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed for after all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you
4836772 bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith saith the lord of hosts if i will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it
4836773 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone
4836774 but this i say he which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully every man according as he purposeth in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for god loveth a cheerful giver and god is able to make all grace abound toward you that ye always having all sufficiency in all things may abound to every good work
4836775 honour the lord with thy substance and with the firstfruits of all thine increase so shall thy barns be filled with plenty and thy presses shall burst out with new wine
4836776 he that giveth unto the poor shall not lack but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse
4836777 but godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out and having food and raiment let us be therewith content
4836778 for which of you intending to build a tower sitteth not down first and counteth the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it lest haply after he hath laid the foundation and is not able to finish it all that behold it begin to mock him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish
4836779 whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might for there is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave whither thou goest
4836780 the desire of the slothful killeth him for his hands refuse to labour
4836781 withhold not good from them to whom it is due when it is in the power of thine hand to do it say not unto thy neighbour go and come again and to morrow i will give when thou hast it by thee
4836782 when they were filled he said unto his disciples gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost
4836783 for where your treasure is there will your heart be also
4836784 he that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich
4836785 let no man seek his own but every man anothers wealth
4836786 jesus said unto him if thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions
4836787 owe no man any thing but to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law
4836788 give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom for with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again
4836789 is not this the fast that i have chosen to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens and to let the oppressed go free and that ye break every yoke then shalt thou call and the lord shall answer thou shalt cry and he shall say here i am if thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke the putting forth of the finger and speaking vanity
4836790 and if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive what thank have ye for sinners also lend to sinners to receive as much again but love ye your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great and ye shall be the children of the highest for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil
4836791 for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses
4836792 through wisdom is an house builded and by understanding it is established and by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches
4836793 i will bless the lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth
4836794 rejoice in the lord alway and again i say rejoice let your moderation be known unto all men the lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god and the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus
4836795 i will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help my help cometh from the lord which made heaven and earth
4836796 and i will say to my soul soul thou hast much goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink and be merry but god said unto him thou fool this night thy soul shall be required of thee then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided so is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich toward god
4836797 there be four things which are little upon the earth but they are exceeding wise the ants are a people not strong yet they prepare their meat in the summer
4836798 this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoureth me with their lips but their heart is far from me
4836799 owe no man any thing but to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law
4836800 bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith saith the lord of hosts if i will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it
4836801 and let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not
4836802 the earth is the lords and the fulness thereof the world and they that dwell therein

4836808 for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater
4836809 give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom for with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again

4837026 the single animal study of pineal function indicates that fluoride exposure results in altered melatonin production and altered timing of sexual maturity whether fluoride affects pineal function in humans remains to be demonstrated the two studies of menarcheal age in humans show the possibility of earlier menarche in some individuals exposed to fluoride but no definitive statement can be made recent information on the role of the pineal organ in humans suggests that any agent that affects pineal function could affect human health in a variety of ways including effects on sexual maturation calcium metabolism parathyroid function postmenopausal osteoporosis cancer and psychiatric disease
4837027 in conclusion the human pineal gland contains the highest concentration of fluoride in the body fluoride is associated with depressed pineal melatonin synthesis by prepubertal gerbils and an accelerated onset of sexual maturation in the female gerbil the results strengthen the hypothesis that the pineal has a role in the timing of the onset of puberty whether or not fluoride interferes with pineal function in humans requires further investigation
4837028 it is remarkable that the pineal gland has never been analysed separately for f because it has several features which suggest that it could accumulate f it has the highest calcium concentration of any normal soft tissue in the body because it calcifies physiologically in the form of hydroxyapatite ha it has a high metabolic activity coupled with a very profuse blood supply two factors favouring the deposition of f in mineralizing tissues the fact that the pineal is outside the blood brain barrier suggests that pineal ha could sequester f from the bloodstream if it has the same strong affinity for f as ha in the other mineralizing tissues the intensity of the toxic effects of most drugs depends upon their concentration at the site of action the mineralizing tissues bone and teeth accumulate high concentrations of f and are the first to show toxic reactions to f hence their reactions to f have been especially well studied if f accumulates in the pineal gland then this points to a gap in our knowledge about whether or not f affects pineal physiology it was the lack of knowledge in this area that prompted my study
4837029 after half a century of the prophylactic use of fluorides in dentistry we now know that fluoride readily accumulates in the human pineal gland
4837030 in terms of mineralized tissue the mean fluoride concentration in the pineal calcification was equivalent to that in severely fluorosed bone and more than four times higher than in corresponding bone ash i e 8 900 7 700 vs 2 040 1 100 mg kg respectively the calcification in two of the 11 pineals analysed in this study contained extremely high levels of fluoride 21 800 and 20 500 mg kg
4837031 fluoride is now introduced at a much earlier stage of human development than ever before and consequently alters the normal fluoride pharmacokinetics in infants but can one dramatically increase the normal fluoride intake to infants and get away with it the safety of the use of fluorides ultimately rests on the assumption that the developing enamel organ is most sensitive to the toxic effects of fluoride the results from this study suggest that the pinealocytes may be as susceptible to fluoride as the developing enamel organ
4837032 alongside the calcification in the developing enamel organ calcification is also occurring in the childs pineal it is a normal physiological process a complex series of enzymatic reactions within the pinealocytes converts the essential amino acid tryptophan to a whole family of indoles the main pineal hormone is melatonin mt if f accumulates in the pineal gland during early childhood it could affect pineal indole metabolism in much the same way that high local concentrations of f in enamel organ and bone affect the metabolism of ameloblasts and osteoblasts
4837033 any adverse physiological effects of fluoride depend upon the concentration at various tissue sites can pinealocytes function normally in close proximity to high concentrations of fluoride one would predict that a high local fluoride concentration would affect pinealocyte function in an analogous way that a high local fluoride concentration affects i bone cells since histological changes have been observed in bone with 2 000 mg f kg baud et al 1978 ii ameloblasts since dental fluorosis develops following fluoride concentrations of 0 2 mg f kg in the developing enamel organ bawden et al 1992 the consequences are disturbances in the functions of bone and enamel i e changes in structure poorly mineralized bone and enamel if the pineal accumulates fluoride at an earlier age than in previous decades one would anticipate that a high local concentration of fluoride within the pineal would affect the functions of the pineal i e the synthesis of hormonal products specifically melatonin the controlled animal study carried out in this study produce compelling evidence that fluoride inhibits pineal melatonin output during pubertal development in the gerbil
4837034 the section on the effects of fluoride on the physiological signs of sexual maturity in the gerbil was a preliminary pilot study there were not enough subjects to make any firm conclusions so an interpretation of the data is conjectural however the results do suggest that the hf high fluoride females had an accelerated onset of puberty as judged by several indices of pubertal development in rodents at 7 weeks the hf females were significantly heavier than the lf females p lt 0 03
4837035 the first step in assessing a health risk by a substance to humans is the identification of its harmful effects on animals a health risk to humans is assessed using results from human epidemiological studies in conjunction with results from animal studies the newburgh kingston study schlesinger et al 1956 showed an earlier age of first menarche in girls living in the fluoridated newburgh than in unfluoridated kingston the current animal study indicates that fluoride is associated with an earlier onset of puberty in female gerbils furthermore more research was recommended on the effects of fluoride on animal and human reproduction usphs 1991 this project has contributed new knowledge in this area
4837036 the most plausible hypothesis for the observed significant decrease in the rate of urinary amt6s excretion by the hf high fluoride group is that fluoride affects the pineals ability to synthesize melatonin during pubertal development in the gerbil fluoride may affect the enzymatic conversion of tryptophan to melatonin although melatonin was the hormone investigated in this project fluoride may also affect the synthesis of melatonin precursors e g serotonin or other pineal products e g 5 methoxytryptamine this would depend on the position s of the susceptible enzyme s for some unknown reason pineal calcification starts intracellularly calcium has been demonstrated in pinealocyte mitochondria therefore it may be a mitochondrial enzyme that is sensitive to the effects of fluoride e g tryptophan 5 hydroxylase alternatively fluoride may affect pinealocyte enzymes which require a divalent co enzyme because such enzymes are particularly sensitive to fluoride
4837037 fluoride is now introduced at a much earlier stage of human development than ever before and consequently alters the normal fluoride pharmacokinetics in infants but can one dramatically increase the normal fluoride intake to infants and get away with it the safety of the use of fluorides ultimately rests on the assumption that the developing enamel organ is most sensitive to the toxic effects of fluoride the results from this study suggest that the pinealocytes may be as susceptible to fluoride as the developing enamel organ the possibility of a species difference between humans and gerbils does not allow the extrapolation of the gerbil data to humans however if increased plasma fluoride levels cause a decline in the levels of circulating melatonin during early human development significant physiological consequences may have already occurred changes in plasma melatonin concentrations are serious functional disturbances because melatonin has many functions in the organism the pinealogists have not completely unravelled the mechanisms by which the pineal gland performs its tasks in the brain the neurochemical phenomenon elicited by melatonin in cns are unclear the first step in assessing a health risk by a substance to humans is the identification of its harmful effects on animals a health risk to humans is assessed using results from human epidemiological studies in conjunction with results from animal studies the newburgh kingston study schlesinger et al 1956 showed an earlier age of first menarche in girls living in the fluoridated newburgh than in unfluoridated kingston the current animal study indicates that fluoride is associated with an earlier onset of puberty in female gerbils furthermore more research was recommended on the effects of fluoride on animal and human reproduction usphs 1991 this project has contributed new knowledge in this area i do not intend to discuss the relative merits of the claims made by the anti fluoridationists that chronic ingestion of low levels of fluoride has harmful effects on human health i e increases the risk of cancer affects the immune system and hastens the aging process these claims could be associated with the effects of fluoride on the pineal because the gland has been linked to oncogenesis immunocompetence and in recent years to the process of aging in conclusion the human pineal gland contains the highest concentration of fluoride in the body fluoride is associated with depressed pineal melatonin synthesis by prepubertal gerbils and an accelerated onset of sexual maturation in the female gerbil the results strengthen the hypothesis that the pineal has a role in the timing of the onset of puberty whether or not fluoride interferes with pineal function in humans requires further investigation

4837101 on earlier occasions of raksha bandhan i have always presented them with gifts but this time i am expecting a gift from them
4837102 its been an eventful and fulfilling year i found love in kareena professionally it was a quiet year there was race but then there were two films that didnt do well i need to focus more on my work i want to put together some good projects and work hard since my personal life is so stable ive no excuse to not give my job my best shot

4837135 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4837136 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4837137 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4837138 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4837139 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4837140 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4837141 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

4837145 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4837146 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4837147 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4837148 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4837149 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4837150 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4837151 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4837152 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation

4837154 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4837155 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4837156 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4837157 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4837158 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4837159 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4837160 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

4837197 in principal in the last races we realised that the speed in the corners has been increased dramatically
4837198 in laguna seca the straightline speed was almost the same as last year but the lap times were 1 5 seconds faster
4837199 it is important to realise that we are increasing the speed in the corners that means that all the work we are doing with the safety commission regarding the safety of the circuit is every time more difficult
4837200 i received from the promotors that it is important to talk about that exactly the same as what has happened with the reduction of the speeds on the straight with 990 to 800 this is the problem we have right now
4837201 yesterday we talked in the grand prix safety commission with some of the riders but due to the importance of the matter we decided to talk with all of the riders
4837202 we asked all them to come to the meeting i introduced to them the problem they agreed they discussed it for one hour they proposed some ideas to be presented to the grand prix commission to try to solve it
4837203 we will present that to the gpc which is made up of the fim msma and dorna then everybody will discuss it
4837204 the promoters of the circuits have spent more than 80 million euro and presently they are spending more than 1 7 million more than they were three years ago on safety
4837205 this is something that cannot continue and is it necessary to go more and more fast no it isnt
4837206 they discussed things but we cannot tell what is the outcome
4837207 we have decided that what they proposed will go to the msma not to the press
4837208 this meeting was to discuss rider safety single tyres could be one of the issues to discuss but it was not the issue to discuss which was safety

4837213 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment

4837215 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

4837224 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4837225 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4837226 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4837227 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

4837237 if my opponent had been there at the moon launch it would have been called a risky rocket scheme

4837240 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
4837241 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4837242 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4837243 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4837244 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

4837253 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
4837254 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
4837255 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4837256 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4837257 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
4837258 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
4837259 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4837260 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4837261 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4837262 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4837263 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4837264 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4837265 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4837266 you learn to ride the waves of that incredible power

4837271 were just now starting to feel worried about how things are going to go in the next few months
4837272 for all our own concerns we have a lot of sympathy for younger people with families and all those expenses
4837273 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4837274 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4837275 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4837276 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4837277 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4837278 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4837279 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4837280 incoming president stan kasten considers the gonzalez signing the equivalent to the braves signing outfielder andruw jones and shortstop rafael furcal in 1993 and 1996 respectively
4837281 we can now compete for the best talent in latin america we will have a presence there
4837282 after midnight on sunday morning bowden rijo brown kasten and principal owner mark lerner met with gonzalez and vizcaino at the capital grille and put together a deal two hours later

4837286 extremely important international talent as well as the draft are the two areas where we get amateur players you have to have both so you need to be active down there and weve been active
4837287 weve done a good job of signing players in the dominican
4837288 rafi reyes a 16 year old dominican whom the white sox signed for a 525 000 bonus last summer according to official major league documents a major league club official said last week that reyes was one of the white sox players whose payment had been improperly handled that he received a small fraction of his bonus perhaps as little as 75 000 with the rest being divvied up among reyess buscon and white sox scouts a high level white sox official speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the matter confirmed that reyes was one of four or five players in the organization whose signing was under investigation
4837289 reyes a fast center fielder with large hands and a ready smile said that he had received 525 000 from the white sox the full bonus agreed to by david wilder himself reyes said that he owed no portion to a buscon because his father rafael reyes sierra ran a baseball program in his hometown baharona and handled the negotiations for him
4837290 it is the way it is good people will get the shaft because of mlbs misunderstanding how business is conducted in that part of the world

4837295 but the issue is clear internal migration has always been an important part of a dynamic economy
4837296 if we are to ensure that people in this country have similar opportunities regardless of where they are born we need to allow people to move from places with few prospects to places that offer more opportunities

4837310 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4837311 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4837312 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4837313 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4837314 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4837315 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4837316 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4837317 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4837318 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4837319 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4837320 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet

4837331 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4837332 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4837333 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4837334 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4837335 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4837336 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012

4837338 what do you want your look to say to people
4837339 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4837340 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4837341 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4837342 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4837343 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4837344 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it

4837349 essential oils are not enough for me anymore i am obsessed with organic i must say
4837350 ko ichi is the originator of the it smells aveda factor
4837351 if i can have these new flowery notes i am pretty sure avedas organic perfume would be quite exciting and interesting
4837352 everybody knows theres no such thing as an organic flower note it would be a breakthrough
4837353 i would go to the ends of the earth to find
4837354 we had to switch to the jasmine treated with the petrochemical solvent
4837355 i am specializing in such a unique field of organic organic organic it is a most difficult challenge
4837356 we must treat more flowers with something other than water and find this plant based organic solvent that is the biggest challenge
4837357 i have to come up with something somehow but its getting harder and harder
4837358 when you are making the conscientious effort to use the organic and natural raw materials obtained from china or india or australia or south america then that certainly places on you a responsibility to be able to stand behind that aspect of your product

4837381 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4837382 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4837383 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4837384 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4837385 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4837386 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4837387 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender

4837389 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4837390 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4837391 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4837392 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4837393 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4837394 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4837395 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4837396 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons

4837398 ive lent my crystal ball to someone so i cant give you the figure
4837399 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4837400 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4837401 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4837402 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4837403 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4837404 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes

4837411 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4837412 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4837413 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4837414 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups

4837424 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4837425 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises

4837442 i dont know the man but i grew up watching him on tv
4837443 we were both really attracted to each other he totally instigated it and pursued me his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty
4837444 at the present time i dont believe we can afford to spend the money
4837445 our part 69 000 is a small amount when you consider what it would cost future councils down the road
4837446 in the coming budget year i would encourage us to keep it in the forefront
4837447 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4837448 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4837449 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can

4837451 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4837452 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4837453 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4837454 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4837455 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4837456 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4837457 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4837458 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4837459 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4837460 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4837461 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4837462 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4837463 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4837464 just so you all know we did set a record
4837465 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4837466 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4837467 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about

4837469 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4837470 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country

4837475 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4837476 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4837477 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4837478 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4837479 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4837480 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4837481 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4837482 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4837483 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4837484 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4837485 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4837486 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world

4837495 georgia georgia no peace i find just an old sweet song keeps georgia on my mind
4837496 we feel confident were doing excellent work and wed like to not have that hanging over our head
4837497 but we just need to keep focused on what our task is even though weve improved its still not acceptable that only 35 of fifth graders are reading proficiently
4837498 for the sixth year in a row california students are continuing to make solid steady progress
4837499 we still have a lot of work to do to reach our goal of universal proficiency but this years gains are particularly encouraging
4837500 indeed with time the narrowing of achievement gaps between groups slows in the elementary grades stops in middle school and then begins to widen again in high school
4837501 we have been almost passive in our allowing of other people to educate our children
4837502 the community of african americans themselves are beginning to very much mobilize behind this issue
4837503 obviously it will take some more money 3 1 billion is the price of the fully loaded christmas tree
4837504 were supposed to have 100 percent of kids take algebra in eighth grade and be proficient
4837505 what is it going to take to get that kind of change its going to take a real investment in services and support i dont think jack is overestimating
4837506 we must make the investments in our school system now in order to meet this extremely tight timetable
4837507 it is now up to the governor to keep his commitment by fully funding the algebra i success initiative
4837508 im glad to see the state superintendent is embracing the goal of teaching algebra to all california eighth graders and moving forward to improve educational achievement in california
4837509 if one really believes that every single eighth grader should take algebra and be proficient in it then an investment of 3 billion is not that substantial
4837510 education improvement is not an elevator ride you have to take the stairs
4837511 at this time the oversight committee reserves endorsing the anticipated bond measure for the november 4 2008 election ballot pending a review of the final language of any ballot measure authorized by the board of education b an assessment of the advisability of placing a school bond measure on the november 4 2008 ballot and c substantial progress in establishing independent outside review of oversight committee operations

4837519 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4837520 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4837521 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4837522 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4837523 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4837524 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4837525 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4837526 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4837527 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4837528 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4837529 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs

4837532 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4837533 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4837534 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4837535 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4837536 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4837537 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4837538 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4837539 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4837540 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4837541 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4837542 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4837543 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4837544 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4837545 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4837546 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4837547 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4837548 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4837549 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4837550 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4837551 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4837552 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt

4837554 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4837555 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4837556 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4837557 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4837558 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4837559 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4837560 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4837561 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4837562 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4837563 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4837564 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4837565 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4837566 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4837567 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4837568 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4837569 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4837570 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4837571 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4837572 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4837573 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4837574 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4837575 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view

4837580 theres no room for debate on this matter these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4837581 now russia needs to honour the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations

4837593 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4837594 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4837595 the difference at the end of the game was torres we know he can score these kind of goals but the team as a whole needs to play well
4837596 i think it was a difficult game first half they controlled the game in the opening 45 minutes but didnt have clear chances other than one we were a little under pressure but the second half was different
4837597 we were controlling it and the quality of our passing was much better
4837598 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al

4837607 it seems too many of us have our identities wrapped up in the measurable outcomes of our work rather than in the life giving love of the christ we proclaim somethings wrong
4837608 a pastors success and self worth is inexorably linked to his her measurable performance stewing in this toxic brew is it any wonder why pastors souls are shriveling somethings wrong

4837634 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4837635 its been a long time since ive read a book in which i highlighted practically every third sentence so it took me a while to read what is in fact a rather short book
4837636 he said that there was a risk that immediately after the games a million chinese will settle in tibet to further dilute the tibetan population
4837637 as the session began and as it built up i felt this lump of emotions welling up and firming up almost like an entity i started to cry a little then it started to dissipate and i started to look at it differently and i think that is the beauty of being able to expand your consciousness i dont think the drug is the cause of these things i think it is a catalyst that allows you to release your own thoughts and feelings from some place that you have bound them to very tightly i began to realise that all of this negative fear and the guilt was such a hindrance to making the most of and enjoying the healthy time that im having however long it may be i was not utilising it to the best and enjoying my life because i was so afraid of what wasnt there yet these substances occur in our natural world and people have been using them for thousands of years to treat physical illness to treat social and behavioural problems
4837638 i think theres a perception these compounds hold untapped potential to help us understand the human mind

4837648 this work provides yet another example of the incredible properties of micro organisms in effecting transformations of metals and minerals in the natural environment
4837649 because fungi are perfectly suited as biogeochemical agents often they dominate the biota in polluted soils and play a major role in the establishment and survival of plants through their association with roots fungal based approaches should not be neglected in our attempts to deal with metal polluted soils
4837650 the fungal produced minerals are capable of long term uranium retention so this may help prevent uptake of uranium by plants animals and microbes it might also prevent the spent uranium from leaching out from the soil
4837651 good god no we dont eat fish meat fruit we dont eat anything its all contaminated you cant you cant

4837664 i feel very strongly about farmers in new england i wouldnt have chosen this business if i didnt feel there was this intrinsic part of new england thats just vanishing my family history is in vermont where the dairy farms are being replaced by townhouses
4837665 places lose their personality when they modernize and homogenize i dont want that to happen for new england theres a strong contingent that wish it wasnt like that everywhere and those are the folks im trying to appeal to
4837666 ive talked with a lot of farmers over the past year or so and by and large their feelings about whole foods condense down to this type of a statement they dont really want to buy enough from me for their customers to regularly buy my products they want to buy enough from me so they can hang a buy local sign with the name of my farm in their produce section
4837667 as hard as they may try i just dont think it is possible for a publicly traded company of their size to do what they want us to think they do they need better profit margins they need to buy cheap stuff and mark it way up at their size this means the buy local part of their business plan is more branding than buying
4837668 im all for farmers markets but theres a huge group of people who dont get the food and theyre the people with the paychecks
4837669 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society

4837673 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4837674 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4837675 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now

4837717 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4837718 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced

4837726 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4837727 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4837728 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny

4837932 we were discussing the issue of how they accounts will be treated for budgetary purposes the practice in the past is that these accounts were not appropriated for separately

4837942 the problem here is that theres not enough text to be able to be really confident about what the passage itself is reading in order to build a theory around it
4837943 it just means that there were more persons in early judaism other than jesus and his followers who were talking about a dying and rising messiah thats not a problem for christianity as far as i can see
4837944 the text deals with some type of angelic communication but beyond that its very hard to tell what all is going on
4837945 i think this stone is as significant as many of the dead sea scrolls but it doesnt seem to have any value for the discussion of jesus except by way of general background text like the dead sea scrolls

4838003 naryu why do you always just walk off like that
4838004 i really dont feel like being with in five feet of that bastard
4838005 please tell me that they dont have any of the same classes as us
4838006 you might not want to do that you already have barely any brain cells left
4838007 we are two pieces of two totally different puzzels hina so there is no way we will ever fit
4838008 were going to get you guys together sooner or later
4838009 its a free country i can stare or look at whatever i want and for your information i was never staring at you
4838010 stop getting such an attitude its bad enough our friends are trying to push us together again but now i have every single class with you
4838011 hi naryu its rafe im sorry that hina did that to us but i promise you i wont let anyone believe it on the bright side though we got hina and joash back together so we dont have to spend as much time together well ill see you at school
4838012 naryu hina wanted me to tell you that shes sorry
4838013 come on naryu she called you like a million times last night and kept telling me how sorry she was and everything she was going to do to make it up to you
4838014 no you listen shes always telling me how i have to be with rafe because of the rules but there she was breaking a rule and i cant be made about thats a little unfair dont you think she ruined my life and im never speaking to her again
4838015 way worse than bad joash keeps trying to get me to make up with hina everyone keeps asking me if you and i are dating oh and on top of that hina keeps staring at me with pleading eyes making me feel guiltier and guiltier
4838016 well anyway we have to present this tomorrow so are you ready
4838017 whats here a cup closed in my true loves hand poison i see hath been his timeless end oh churl drink all and left no friendly drop to help me after i will kiss thy lips haply some poison yet doth hang on them to make me die with restorative
4838018 rafe and i arent even friends so we are not dating
4838019 do you guys know how good you look together though
4838020 i wanted for so long to kiss you like that
4838021 but yet at the same time i hated and might still hate you for what happened in our past and i can tell you still hate me
4838022 rafe i think we should just continue to stay away from each other i cant explain it but i cant let that happen again
4838023 what did happen i know what you did but what did i do
4838024 yeah i just had my eyes opened by an unsuspecting force it let me know whats important youve been my friend since forever and i cant just throw that away over something silly ive been overreacting a lot lately im confused hina and it has been taking me apart piece by piece
4838025 it also didnt help that i was trying to force you with your worst enemy
4838026 it didnt help but you didnt know you were trying to get me to be happy
4838027 can we just put this behind us and be friends again
4838028 naryu i know that you are probably even more mad at me for what i did yesterday i know that you and i both have been confused lately and it didnt help that i acted on my feelings i dont think that we should stay away from each other but i know that its best we tried being friends and even being a couple and neither worked out so i guess its destine that were enemies anyways i just wanted to say sorry for putting you through all of this rafe
4838029 i know you well enough to know that its not nothing
4838030 dont deny it ive seen you hes been doing the same to you but then again he always has
4838031 rafe this time is different because we arent friends anymore im not just going to repair our friendship every time you havent made an attempt to even talk to me in months were not just going to pick up where we left off anymore
4838032 its been months since that incident and ive been confused ever since then
4838033 what did i do to make you hate me so much
4838034 you stopped caring you stopped being the guy i fell in love with
4838035 you made a promise to me when we first met you told me that no matter what you would be there but you werent you didnt even blink when my dad died
4838036 oh its not then how come you never came when i needed you most i was always there for you and then you just all the sudden break off our friendship and start changing into someone else
4838037 just forget about him why dont you come to the pool party that joash and i are throwing tonight
4838038 fine then maybe i can get my mind off of the stupid ignorrant conceited little
4838039 sango how am i suppose to forget about that little jerk if hes here
4838040 im leaving and if you stop me then i will never talk to you again
4838041 naryu youre making too big a deal out of this
4838042 joash and i got in a fight yesterday and we broke up
4838043 he was groping and flirting with other women so i told him it was over and that i was tired of it
4838044 thats alright i dont think joash and i were ever really meant to be anyway
4838045 dont say that you and joash are always together and always make each other laugh what makes you think you arent supposed to be together
4838046 its just that he is also being pervert and never sticks to one girl some people like that but i for one dont
4838047 you got to give him credit though he has changed a lot for you compared to how he used to be
4838048 well yeah but if he cant stop flirting with ever girl he comes in contact with then i dont think i can even stand to look at him
4838049 i dont talk to stuck up losers either but we all have to make sacrifices dont we
4838050 yes hina and joash broke up yesterday and i need you to help me get them back together
4838051 theyll get back together on their own just like they always do
4838052 hina told me to give it back to joash she hasnt taken it off since they first started going out now its symbolic
4838053 because if we get them together they will stop trying to get us together because theyll owe us

4838072 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4838073 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4838074 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4838075 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4838076 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4838077 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4838078 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4838079 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4838080 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4838081 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4838082 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4838083 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4838084 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4838085 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4838086 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4838087 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4838088 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4838089 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4838090 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4838091 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4838092 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4838093 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4838094 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4838095 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4838096 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4838097 p st ile violete umpleau c mpul cu idei absurde
4838098 s a scris at t de mult nc t fatal tot ce se mai scrie pare c s a mai spus se repet con tient sau incon tient aproape fond i form de condeiele de meserie i de acei de bun credin care au curajul s cread c sunt cu totul originali
4838099 minnesotans have always been known for their hospitality and it was great to see the enthusiasm of so many people who showed up to volunteer their time to help us get ready for one of the biggest events minneapolis saint paul has ever seen
4838100 this is truly our time to shine in the eyes of the nation and the world and we have now added a little more sparkle as we get ready to roll out the welcome mat
4838101 we need to persuade them to promote the country we are demanding internal programmes in hotels to promote the country for example by using pictures of wildlife parks
4838102 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4838103 this is a planning took where all things are going
4838104 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4838105 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4838106 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4838107 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4838108 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4838109 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4838110 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4838111 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4838112 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4838113 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4838114 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4838115 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4838116 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4838117 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4838118 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4838119 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4838120 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4838121 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4838122 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4838123 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4838124 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4838125 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4838126 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4838127 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4838128 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4838129 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4838130 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4838131 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4838132 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4838133 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4838134 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4838135 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4838136 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4838137 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4838138 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4838139 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4838140 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4838141 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4838142 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4838143 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4838144 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4838145 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4838146 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4838147 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4838148 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4838149 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4838150 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4838151 who gave him authority over the earth and who has laid on him the whole world if he should determine to do so if he should gather to himself his spirit and his breath all flesh would perish together and man would return to dust
4838152 then david said to the philistine goliath you come to me witha sword a spear and a javelin but i come to you in the name of the lord of hosts the god of the armies of israel whom you have taunted
4838153 the word of the lord came expressly to ezekiel and the hand of the lord came upon him
4838154 when jesus had finished these words the crowds were amazed at his teaching for he was teaching them as one having authority and not as their scribes
4838155 who is this guy to be forgiving sins and whatnot
4838156 why are you reasoning in your hearts which is easier to says your sins have been forgiven you or to say get up and walk
4838157 will receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you and you shall be my witnesses both in jerusalem and in all judea and samaria and even to the remotest part of the earth
4838158 god was performing extraordinary miracles by the hands of paul
4838159 therefore i exhort the elders among you as your fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of christ and a partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed shepherd the flock of god among you exercising oversight not under compulsion but voluntarily according to the will of god and not for sordid gain but with eagerness nor yet as lording it over those allotted to your charge but proving to be examples to the flock and when the chief shepherd appears you will receive the unfading crown of glory you younger men likewise be subject to your elders and all of you clothe yourselves with humility toward one another for god is opposed to the proud but gives grace to the humble
4838160 times of suffering and persecution in the church call for the noblest leadership
4838161 he gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as pastors and teachers for the equipping of the saints for the work of service to the building up of the body of christ until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to a mature man to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of christ
4838162 du kennst eben echte m nner die lieben es wenn ihre freundin strippt alles andere kann ihnen gestohlen bleiben

4838165 martabak manis aja deh bang di samping saya udah ada telor ini
4838166 quando que vamos ver o wall e e quando que vamos ao parque aqu tico
4838167 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4838168 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4838169 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4838170 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4838171 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4838172 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4838173 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4838174 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4838175 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4838176 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4838177 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4838178 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4838179 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4838180 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4838181 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4838182 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4838183 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4838184 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4838185 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4838186 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4838187 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4838188 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4838189 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4838190 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4838191 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional

4838199 so what did you think of me the first time you saw me
4838200 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4838201 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4838202 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4838203 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

4838214 yeah theyve been trying to get us together for 3 weeks now when will they see that we will never be a couple
4838215 well as soon as tutoring is over we will never even have to talk to one another

4838353 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down

4838368 if that pipeline were destroyed or controlled by russia european energy supplies would be even more vulnerable to russian influence
4838369 one disruption of supply abroad can suddenly raise energy prices inflicting great harm on our economy and on america workers and in the term of the next president skillful handling of such a crisis could be the difference between temporary hardship and far reaching disaster
4838370 all of this only adds to the urgency of producing more of our own energy including americas enormous oil reserves that lie offshore

4838389 seg n las reglas de las operaciones militares hay nueve clases de terrenos 1 donde los intereses locales pelean unos contra otros es lo que se llama terreno de disoluci n 2 cuando penetras en territorio ajeno sin profundidad se llama terreno liviano 3 el espacio que puede ser ventajoso para cualquiera de los contrincantes se llama terreno de contenci n 4 la tierra en la cual ambos bandos pueden ir y venir se llama terreno transitado 5 la tierra que tiene tres lados rodeados por el enemigo y uno de uni n con el terreno propio se llama terreno de intersecci n 6 cuando se penetra profundamente en el territorio enemigo cruzando muchas ciudades y pueblos se llama terreno pesado 7 cuando se cruzan monta as selv ticas desfiladeros empinados ci nagas o cualquier campo dif cil de transitar se llama terreno malo 8 cuando el camino es estrecho y la salida tortuosa de manera que una peque a fuerza enemiga pueda atacar a n cuando se tenga un n mero mayor se llama terreno rodeado 9 cuando se puede sobrevivir si se batalla con rapidez o al contrario perecer se llama terreno de muerte as pues no debes batallar en un terreno de disoluci n no debes detenerte en un terreno liviano ni atacar en terreno de contenci n ni dejarte aislar en un terreno transitado en terreno de intersecci n debes crear comunicaciones en terreno pesado saquea en terreno malo sigue en terreno rodeado haz planes y en terreno de muerte pelea
4838390 la geopol tica contempor nea se caracteriza por una compleja coexistencia de espacios absolutamente controlados y de territorios planificados al lado de nuevas tierras inc gnitas que funcionan con una l gica interna propia al margen del sistema que los ha engendrado la guerrilla zapatista los narcotraficantes colombianos los se ores de la guerra somal es las tribus urbanas o las mafias rusas se nos aparecen como nuevos agentes sociales creadores de nuevas regiones con unos l mites imprecisos y cambiantes dif ciles de percibir y a n m s de cartografiar pero enormemente atractivas desde un punto de vista intelectual
4838391 la frontera pol tica considerada bajo el ngulo de un l mite de soberan a sigue siendo por esencia el per metro espacial y legal del sistema pol tico
4838392 dominio terrestre es el control pol tico y militar sobre el heartland pero si se posee tambi n el control de los mares su dominio puede ser universal

4838396 la geopol tica se origina en el concepto de que la naturaleza en tanto tal con sus efectos sobre el hombre regula la conducta humana y as define sus intereses tal como aseveran los diversos geopol ticos
4838397 aunque los estados unidos no tienen inter s en obtener porciones de los espacios que logren como resultado de su esfuerzo militar si tiene el inter s inmediato de implantar y mantener un orden universal que ser la compensaci n de sus sacrificios
4838398 la geopol tica claro es de particular importancia ya que es el dogma reinante m s o menos desde la d cada de 1 880 en esa forma de la fuerza olig rquica culpable de las dos guerras mundiales que ha habido en el siglo xx y de las diversas formas colonialistas y neocolonialistas de fines del siglo xix y del siglo xx incluida la forma neocolonialista que los brit nicos y otros paganos del mismo parecer como felipe o carlos de la familia real brit nica quienes han promovido el culto a gaia pretenden imponerle al mundo
4838399 el crecimiento de la uni n europea y la configuraci n de una zona norteamericana de libre comercio por ejemplo son en parte intenciones de ejercer influencia pol tica sobre los asuntos econ micos a una escala mayor que la del estado nacional

4838444 pension reform in my view is our no 1 priority and that is saying a lot given all our other problems
4838445 the administration is focused on pension issues and fully intends to put forward reforms that will address outstanding issues and ensure that our pension obligations are reasonable and sustainable going forward
4838446 i dont envision us forming a task force the issues are known and straightforward we simply have to gather the full range of information and propose recommendations to council
4838447 we would expect to do all that this calendar year
4838448 ever since ive been on council the liability has been huge

4838460 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4838535 i think its good for the base and the community because the bucs organization is so supportive of the military folks
4838536 its obviously a great thrill of ours to be around the men and women that are really great leaders its stimulating and its awesome we made some friends and reunited with some others its important and we appreciate our armed services and the people here at macdill
4838537 a lot of our players this is their third time here but for some its new lets keep things in perspective football is exciting and fun but this is reality these people here have made tremendous sacrifices they work their life to protect us and lead us its great to be around them and show them that we care i just think its good education for all of us and keeps things in perspective
4838538 i just want to thank you guys for coming out here the players and the bucs organization because what youre doing here means a lot to all the people out here

4838541 either enter jordan without religious objects or go back to israel
4838542 they seemed to know exactly what they were looking for
4838543 it was very demeaning to have such a negative experience in what is billed as a friendly country people in the group including the tour guides were quite shocked no one had ever heard that jordan imposed religious restrictions
4838544 what made it worse was that the whole thing seemed to be directed solely at jews i saw christians walking through into jordan openly wearing crosses apparently christian religious symbols did not seem to be a problem for the jordanians i can well imagine the international outcry if islamic tourists were to encounter such restrictions on their entry into israel
4838545 the jordanian security authorities are responsible for the safety of all visitors to the kingdom and it is our duty to take all measures required in this regard
4838546 the vast majority of the group decided that as proud israelis we were either going to be allowed to walk into jordan holding our religious objects or we would not go in at all

4838559 many ossetians i met both in tskhinvali and in the main refugee camp in russia are furious about what has happened to their city
4838560 they are very clear who they blame georgias president mikhail saakashvili who sent troops to re take control of this breakaway region
4838561 witness accounts and the timing of the damage would point to georgian fire accounting for much of the damage described in tskhinvali
4838562 this is something that had it been about south ossetia could have been resolved within certain limits
4838563 russian peacekeepers were in the area that is true and russia initially said it needed to act to protect its peacekeepers and its people
4838564 but what russia has done is well beyond anything that anyone could say is for the protection of those people and for those peacekeepers
4838565 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation is that clear enough
4838566 imagine that we had been forced into military action on the side of georgia as a nato member on the side of an obvious gambler as one must describe saakashvili
4838567 i dont believe russia is pursuing a policy of annexation and i also dont believe that there will be a return to the previous status quo for south ossetia and abkhazia that is out of the question
4838568 i think little of demonizing russia and i believe moscow will soon see the need for greater integration into the international community

4838613 you are being tested your will is being tested your will to keep someone alive can you do that can you grant somebody the gift of life
4838614 my dear friends welcome to the show five long memorable years have passed since i first opened my doors to you some of you here ive known since the first day others ive known a very short time all that matters is that you are all my friends and patrons for a reason but
4838615 but im beginning to think youve gotten just a bit too comfortable you feel like its your right to be here not that its a privilege those who do not appreciate the exciting life of this place do not deserve to partake in it
4838616 dont despair just yet im going to give you a chance to prove to me that you really want to be here that you really want this to go on for years to come so i want to play a game
4838617 now hush darlings or you wont hear my instructions they must be followed to the letter or else it will not end well for you at all
4838618 there are 36 of you in each cell and its awfully crowded in there ive spent the last five years killing myself to entertain you to make you happy and give you an oasis of intelligence and delightful eccentricity for you to bask in now its time for you to return the favor i will give you thirty minutes to plan and in that thirty minutes you need to come up with some way of entertaining me if someone wont participate or doesnt like who theyve been grouped with they get eliminated and once youre eliminated from this game there is no chance to try again
4838619 i will see each of you individually but it will be easier to lump you into eight groups than to have one giant line of people so you will all get to entertain me one at a time there is only one judging factor if i laugh out loud youre safe even a giggle will suffice if you cant even bring a smile to my face you dont belong here you have no place in my world or in the greater world outside so stay or be eliminated make your choice
4838620 hey she only gave us a half hour and we just wasted five minutes i think we should get busy and do what the hell she told us to

4838631 none of us were all going to die down there
4838632 i dont think i can laugh anymore tonight give me a minute and ill unlock the doors you can all go home
4838633 im glad you approve i kept that special dungeon room a secret all these years waiting until tonight to unveil it everyone down there is having a blast right now theres a dantes inferno theme down there complete with hot wings deviled eggs all kinds of goofy little hell theme food and decor its as plush as the vip room just way bigger and way hotter when they do finally come upstairs later theyre going to be so excited with how much fun it is down there that they wont even care about how much they were scared
4838634 ive arranged a special private dinner for us in the vip lounge by now all the catering should be set out whos hungry

4838640 sentimenti il nome che diamo a delle sensazioni astratte che ci pervadono l animo fino a sfiorarci il cuore ci fanno toccare il cielo con un dito a volte ci agitano e tormentano altre volte ci fanno sentire pazze d allegria altre volte aprono un grande vuoto che vorremmo tappare ma che solo il tempo sa sanare ci sono sentimenti a cui addirittura non sappiamo dare un nome perch dargli un nome non gli renderebbe giustizia sono moltissimi e difficilmente potremmo classificarli a seconda della loro intensit nel manifestarsi potremmo paragonarli a dei colori ma difficilmente potremmo impedirgli di smettere di colorare la nostra vita al contrario di quelli reali dunque possiamo dargli un inizio ma non sempre una fine

4838664 there has been a lot of misinformation on this issue
4838665 some idea was put out by i dont know who a rumour or some source that the chair leads the discussion that is just not the case my view is im there to ensure that the meeting runs well and fairly and that the vote is taken fairly not to weigh in in favour or against a particular candidate
4838666 i feel reasonably comfortable about the process doing it the way i have outlined that i do it and not getting involved in voting for a particular candidate or advocating for a particular candidate
4838667 i made a personal policy decision that i would not weigh in for or against a particular name and that is the way i have always proceeded
4838668 in fact i do not vote except i reserve the right to vote in the rare case of a tie im told that i voted once to break a tie i dont have a recollection of that my recollection is that i have never voted
4838669 based on the explanation that chief justice mclachlin gave us today what she explained her role as it is not likely to be viewed as judicial misconduct
4838670 as the chief justice said from day one the chief justice has chaired the order of canada
4838671 in light of the role that she has assigned to herself id be surprised if many people would have a problem with the way that she carries out that particular role
4838672 these are historical things that judges have done over the years because of our reputation for indepedence and impartiality
4838673 at some point in time i think that we have to look at those kind of roles as our society changes and people become more aware of the distinct role that the three branches of government had
4838674 the bottom line is if its not about misconduct the complaint is going to be dismissed without asking the judge involved to comment
4838675 i have not said and if i did im going to correct myself that the complaint against chief justice mclachlin is without merit i havent said it is with merit either ive simply said that i dont see a problem in a judge or the chief justice of canada performing the role that she described for us this morning and id be shocked if any other judge in the country had a different opinion
4838676 you have to remember that really the possibility of a conflict between a particular nomination and a future issue that might come before the court is very remote
4838677 and you must also remember that in the judiciary conflicts do occasionally arise we do our best to avoid them ever happening but the fact they happen is something you can deal with if and when they happen

4838721 i saw him diving in my next breath i looked up and saw him touching my kayak i said i cant die and ruin his day i was worried about him then dakota showed up i think theyre two heroes i couldnt believe how fast everything was happening
4838722 they were soaking wet and they were out of breath because theyre both out of shape as young as they are
4838723 they did a selfless act and they did it without hesitation you cant tell them no no no and not reward them for the positive things
4838724 it feels really good doing something good to help someone
4838725 never had any interest myself i think it is stupid what do you like about it
4838726 never had any interest myself but i am interested in what you like about it tell me more about that
4838727 my intention was just to ask what people like about the us
4838728 i wouldnt want to live or study in either one of them
4838729 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4838730 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4838731 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4838732 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4838733 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4838734 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4838735 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4838736 in essence what were going to do is bring everyone to the table and say weve identified you and were going to give you two paths to go down
4838737 we would prefer you to take this path where we have some resources in place for you to use and people who genuinely want to help you and change your lifestyle or youre going to go down this path where were going to target you and its going to be one where youll end up in jail and possibly in jail for a very long time
4838738 you already have them on the list and youre just waiting for them to trip and then you move on them
4838739 i certainly dont want to be part of an effort that gives the parents nor these young men false expectations that we have a safety net there
4838740 as a neighborhood preacher i am tired of the only phone calls i get is when a young man has been killed or a young woman is shot and they need a preacher
4838741 i want to be a preacher who can help turn young lives around and i think thats where were at right now its time to partner with the police department to save our community
4838742 when you come in to the reverend spence im going to hand you a piece of paper and find out what your needs are im going to go over it with my crew and were going to find people in our community who do just that

4838749 were very concerned about the soundscape and any potential visual intrusion and dust
4838750 a lot of folks are very supportive of it and would like the benefit of shaving 90 to 100 miles off their commute
4838751 locals are all for it but i wonder how heavy they federal officials will weigh it in a county losing population
4838752 its not like we just threw a dart this is not only the logical location but the only place that is feasible because of terrain
4838753 otherwise wed have to plow through 6 miles of untouched badlands

4838758 i think fernald is a good model for other sites
4838759 a plan was developed that the community was comfortable with and that didnt push all of the waste into someone elses backyard but that recognized the need for monitoring the site in the future

4838773 we got a lot of snaps in and a lot of kids will have a chance to watch film of themselves in the stadium
4838774 there werent many turnovers and some guys were making plays
4838775 you realize that this season is your last chance to do a lot of things today was my last saturday scrimmage everyday is your last something
4838776 we play these scrimmages to win we had a few fumbles and took 165 snaps there is a lot of film to watch from today and a lot to learn from
4838777 both the defense and offense did some good things today we turned the ball over a couple times which we cant do but overall i think it went well it was good to go out and throw the ball around
4838778 pongamos manos a la obra y nos dejemos de dimes y diretes para empezar a hacer cada uno lo que nos compete para enfrentar al crimen organizado
4838779 esto ocurre porque seguramente nos fallan las leyes y tenemos que perfeccionarlas pero tambi n fallan las autoridades ejecutivas en todos los rdenes de gobierno para poner ante los jueces a los responsables de los delitos y tambi n fallan los jueces
4838780 que es una tarea de toda la acci n de gobierno y hay un fuerte reclamo ciudadano que se va a manifestar durante la marcha del 30 de agosto y creo que todos debemos tomarlo con enorme sensibilidad
4838781 nadie politice ese asunto porque nadie tiene derecho a hacerlo
4838782 todos los poderes incluyo al judicial al ejecutivo y legislativo tenemos que hacer mucho para mejorar nuestro trabajo
4838783 el paquete de seguridad que nos queda en leyes secundarias
4838784 its an historic opportunity and i think it hearkens back to the values people had when the wilderness act was first published in 1964
4838785 an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man where man himself is a visitor who does not remain
4838786 were very concerned with this big mass push for wilderness thats going on right now
4838787 there are better choices in todays world for protecting that land and preserving the access thats so needed for recreation
4838788 chose to ignore wilderness proposals even when there was a great deal of consensus in support of them
4838789 to ensure that the land is preserved as god intended

4838795 i find it strange that the regions parliamentary committees head demanded to hold an extraordinary session for the political council for national security to come up with a consensus formula regarding the provincial elections bill
4838796 he knows very well that the parliamentary voting that occurred on july 22 2008 was legal but was reversed for partisan motivations
4838797 this demand is unbalanced misses politically and ignores the iraqi parliaments decision
4838798 the political council for national security represents the parties in power only
4838799 i demand to dissolve this council because it does not represent the iraqi peoples ambition anymore but the will of some parties
4838800 in my capacity as the head of the regions committee i call on the political council for national security to hold an extraordinary session to discuss the disagreements on the election law and to reach an agreement that satisfies everyone
4838801 most of the disagreements on article 24 of the law have been settled
4838802 these failures of science online are all examples where scientists show a surprising reluctance to share knowledge that could be useful to others

4838806 iranian experts who acquired a good know how in setting up power stations and extension of high pressure lines are ready to offer their experience to their iraqi counterparts
4838807 iranian companies will carry out a project of a power station with a capacity of 320 megawatt in the eastern baghdad district of sadr city
4838808 we have developed a separate category for non iraqis displaced persons and those who have passed away
4838809 the commission is doing its best to prevent rigging in the upcoming elections a total of 20 000 observers have been trained and 20 000 others are currently under training
4838810 nearly 90 000 to 100 000 arabs have been removed from electoral registers
4838811 if the law is passed in september we will try to hold the elections this year
4838812 if an optimal solution is really sought for this crisis this should only take place through accordance not by forcing opinions
4838813 my commitment with the club the fans and the players is so big that just because i can be disappointed about different things i wont stop trying my best to achieve all of the targets that we have established as a team
4838814 my family and myself are very thankful to the club the fans and the city and we will never give up fighting to get the best for liverpool
4838815 i dont read headlines on the day of the game but my commitment is 100 with the fans with the players and with the club in general i say 100 times my family is happy here we want to win trophies at this club because it is a massive club
4838816 if we have problems because we are not doing things which in my opinion as a manager we could do i will work as hard as i can for the club
4838817 i will not talk about any player but in april i was talking about this behind the scenes
4838818 we tried to do things in confidentiality but sometimes you cannot and you need to explain before the end of the transfer window if the manager has an idea and it is not a question of money then we have to make the right decisions in terms of whom we bring in that has to be the decision of the manager
4838819 i thought this four years ago and i think it now if you are quicker it is easier to sign the target you have
4838820 i was in contact with tom hicks and he told me we had the money we have sold players for more than 20million in the summer and he told me if you sell players you can buy with that too
4838821 i have the support of at least one of the owners i sent emails to all of them but he hicks was clear we had the money
4838822 it is not something that i can explain you have to analyse it but to me it is clear they were supporting me if we had money and we do have money
4838823 for me it is not a problem and im not going to worry about it because he is going to be our player it is not a concern
4838824 at no point has robinho given the impression that he does not want to go to valencia
4838825 he is very well i have spoken with him and the player is in perfect shape
4838826 he is training normally is here to play and therefore he is going to play
4838827 i can only assess what robinho does here and with us everything is normal in the games he has played in pre season he has done very well played with a lot of joy and its the same in training
4838828 i have to say that i havent seen any change in his attitude
4838829 our approach is unique in the world no one else has yet developed customized immunotherapy using the virus from individual patients
4838830 this experimental technique remains long and costly for the moment but were hoping it will hold the promise of a completely innovative and widely available treatment in the future
4838831 at this stage we have shown that the technique doesnt cause side effects or an undesirable auto immune response
4838832 and there were no differences on those measures in the alcohol group compared to the no alcohol group
4838833 this suggests that the effect we observed wasnt due to a general change in mood
4838834 but some of our results suggest that theres more going on than we might have thought
4838835 the main question is whether these effects are specific to faces or whether we would rate anything as more attractive after a drink
4838836 to see if alcohol has a more general effect on perceiving beauty in the environment
4838837 its also surprising to see this effect is happening at lower doses than you might think
4838838 were trying to build up a more complete picture of what happens when people go out for a drink and were interested in certain behaviours that are more common after drinking such as unsafe sex or violence if this effect is happening at lower doses than expected it might be helpful for people who are predisposed to such behaviours to anticipate those situations and prevent them
4838839 but there are practical and ethical constraints around how much alcohol we can give people in the lab
4838840 russias position is unchanged we will support any decisions taken by the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia

4838844 our goal today was to play a lot of the younger guys and find the best 11 players to play on offense and the best 11 to play on defense
4838845 we pulled a lot of the veteran players early ricky sapp james davis c j spiller michael hamlin chris clemons they didnt play much today we wanted to see what some of the younger players could do it was also our goal to find the best 12th 13th and 14th players on each side of the ball
4838846 as a result we had some odd lineups in there and it showed in our consistency and execution but overall it was a good practice

4838871 it was felt that his behavior on the medal podium and during the medal ceremony was not appropriate
4838872 his behavior was not in the olympic spirit of respect for his fellow athletes whatever grievances you may have this was not the way to go about it
4838873 the awards ceremony is a highly symbolic ritual acknowledged as such by all athletes and other participants
4838874 any disruption by any athlete in particular a medalist is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the olympic movement it is also contrary to the spirit of fair play

4838883 he had fire in him and we could see that he wanted to excel

4838901 when one party agrees to host a foreign facility of course it assumes certain responsibilities and were talking about a military facility in this case so there is additional responsibility
4838902 certainly any facility is the target excuse me i mean the subject of the interests of another country so of course one has to be careful with that a bordering country always makes it its priority to strike such installations in case of conflict so it is not simply it cannot go unpunished from the point of view of its military use and so on
4838903 these installations only worsen the situation we will be forced to respond adequately

4839186 that cliff line is a wasps nest of caves capatin squishies pop and disappear all through the northern range weve marked nearly a thousand entrances and suspect at least half of them are naturally networked who knows what the squishies have done since if they went even a dozen meters into a cave we could lose the signal
4839187 so now youre going back and saying these so called former blackbie employees have collaborated with your squamiform infestation then that hardly makes sense
4839188 no no youre not listening that quadry who are most assuredly no longer representing blacbie are many unflattering things but they are not collaborators theyve killed as many squishies in the field as our cavebusters they know those caves better than our cartographers so clearly theyve gone underground
4839189 so what are you telling me we go from flushing your city to flushing your caves this is becoming ridiculous well pin them down and call in a proper ground team to melt this snowball and flood out your caves

4839222 r egrettably there is considerable evidence that elements of the bush administration were complicit in the 9 11 attack and may even have helped stage it

4839224 the pentagon had been studying possible targets in the same spring i e 1998 that the cia had been drawing up its secret plan to raid tarnack farm
4839225 leads to one person as well as one global terrorist organization
4839226 we have very good evidence of links between osama bin laden al qaeda operatives and what happened on september 11
4839227 proof had to be delivered that the september 11 terror attack came from abroad
4839228 i have seen absolutely powerful and incontrovertible evidence of his osama bin ladens link to the events of the 11th of september
4839229 there is no evidence presented in the dossier that directly links bin laden to september 11
4839230 there was no doubt of bin ladens responsibility for the september 11 attacks before the tape was discovered
4839231 the american translators who listened to the tapes and transcribed them apparently wrote a lot of things in that they wanted to hear but that cannot be heard on the tape no matter how many times you listen to it
4839232 the reason why 9 11 is not mentioned on osama bin ladens most wanted page is because the fbi has no hard evidence connecting bin laden to 9 11
4839233 bin laden has not been formally charged in connection with 9 11
4839234 the fbi gathers evidence once evidence is gathered it is turned over to the department of justice the department of justice then decides whether it has enough evidence to present to a federal grand jury in the case of the 1998 united states embassies being bombed bin laden has been formally indicted and charged by a grand jury he has not been formally indicted and charged in connection with 9 11 because the fbi has no hard evidence connecting bin laden to 9 11
4839235 we havent heard much from him i e bin laden and i wouldnt necessarily say hes at the center of any command structure and again i dont know where he is i ill repeat what i said i truly am not that concerned about him
4839236 a cautionary tale about rushing to judgment in attributing responsibility for a terrorist act
4839237 please contact me upon your return to the states so we can continue this dialogue
4839238 received all of the department of defense documents on able danger and had found no mention of atta
4839239 the 9 11 commission failed to recognize the sustained comprehensive efforts conducted by the intelligence community prior to 9 11 to penetrate the al qaeda organization
4839240 one of the most important pieces of evidence the fbi would ever discover allowing investigators to map the links of the al qaeda network all across the globe
4839241 did not rec ognize the significance of what they had

4839243 what went wrong the c i a and the failure of american intelligence
4839244 the great conspiracy the 9 11 news special you never saw
4839245 i was not involved in the september 11 attacks in the united states nor did i have knowledge of the attacks there exists a government within a government within the united states the united states should try to trace the perpetrators of these attacks within itself to the people who want to make the present century a century of conflict between islam and christianity that secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks the american system is totally in the control of the jews whose first priority is israel not the united states i have already said that we are not hostile to the united states we are against the system which makes other nations slaves of the united states or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom
4839246 al qaeda leaders say nuclear power stations were original targets

4839278 dear editor some of your readers may be interested to know that at a meeting last april the traditional latin mass society of st oliver was established in kilkenny the purpose of this society was to highlight and promote the traditional extraordinary gregorian rite of the mass already in kilkenny people have had an opportunity to assist at the traditional mass when it was celebrated last february in the capuchin friary after this mass there were numerous queries as to when the next one would be celebrated it is to be hoped that this will happen soon in the meantime it is worth noting that in glengoole new birmingham near urlingford the traditional latin mass is celebrated on the first thursday of every month no mass in august this rite of mass differs from the novus ordo in that the priest faces in the same direction as the people the prayers are mostly different and holy communion is always received on the tongue from the priest while kneeling the st oliver society of kilkenny wishes to express its appreciation of and gratitude for the fairly recent motu proprio of pope benedict which has the intention of making the traditional mass more freely available to the faithful who have a wish to assist at the same form of catholic mass which existed for centuries prior to the introduction of of the novus ordo form almost forty years ago sincerely tony madden hon secretary 3 larchfield kilkenny

4839297 when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of natures god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness

4839350 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4839351 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most

4839355 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4839356 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

4839362 by our victory we did not just bring honor to our country but also demonstrated that even becoming olympic champion does not make us happy if we have no peace in our homeland
4839363 we did not need to talk much everyone saw it as for the option of withdrawing from the games i am one who wants to get back home as soon as possible since my wife is awaiting our second child right now
4839364 of course there was immense mental pressure and our job was to make the athletes understand that they have to fight their fight here at the olympic games
4839365 and i am happy my pupil did really well defeated all his opponents and became one of the most worthy champions
4839366 it is obvious that nobody will be able to stay here any longer
4839367 some members of the team have somebody wounded or even dead among their relatives everyone is concerned about their families their country and i think it is a very natural decision and my husband was informed about such a mood in the delegation
4839368 we went to see the president of the ioc mr rogge and briefed him about the situation he earnestly asked us not to withdraw otherwise we could have serious problems with the participation at the london olympics in 2012
4839369 we told him that some of our athletes have lost relatives friends or neighbors three of our sportsmen are from gori which had been bombarded on that very day they did not even know whether their parents and relatives were alive

4839748 kevin boss is going to be a good receiver hes going to make a lot of catches i think he is going to be the first one to tell you that he needs to continue to work on his blocking
4839749 kevin has a big role to fill and hes still got a lot to learn in becoming a big playmaker for us
4839750 last year when we lost shockey we did some more four wide receiver stuff when we got into passing downs we put steve smith in the tight end position and let him do some of the things that we tried to do with shockey well see how we manage but hopefully a whole lot wont change and well still use a lot of tight end formations kevin will have to step up

4839796 if its the truth and if we are given a fair go which we deserve to have it will be fine from what we understand in regard to the police investigation ex girlfriends and friends have all been contacted and potentially they are investigating other things which is just ludicrous

4839811 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4839812 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4839813 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4839814 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4839815 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4839816 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4839817 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4839818 you come off a series against texas where it feels like youre scoring 12 runs a game
4839819 but he did a good job a real good job he came out of nowhere and put us on the map
4839820 i thought denver would be my last stop but things happened and here i am
4839821 the thing thats always impressed me the most is the way they play the game
4839822 he is a guy i have admired for a long time his playing style and his production he has been a great player with different organizations and with nine pro bowls
4839823 im kind of nervous the reason why being what we did last year as a whole unit
4839824 were going to try and come out and put points on the board because thats what the coaches ask us to do the expectations the bars set so high here not by you all and not by the fans but the coaches and the team we have high expectations for this offense and this team as a unit but what we did last year man i dont think we can really live and dwell off that
4839825 its the opportunity to pitch a couple of times before the end of the season
4839826 were pushing for a major league opportunity an affiliated opportunity he obviously needs to pitch
4839827 too many people trying to tinker with his mechanics and not let kyle jackson be the pitcher he is and he had too many roles it was just difficult
4839828 hes a local kid and we made every attempt to get him into a pride uniform we wish him the best
4839829 he was the first person to call me asking about jacksons availability
4839830 the red sox organization is stacked for him to be on the 40 man roster for two years is quite an accomplishment
4839831 i tried to help a little bit but i cant
4839832 so im pretty much done for the year ill help them out a little bit throw some bp and help out the guys in the bullpen
4839833 hes been trying to fight through it the last three weeks
4839834 weve tried to fight it in so many different ways but the only way to do it is through rest
4839835 its sad but youre not always going to win the championship every year
4839836 weve had to deal with a lot of injuries here as a team its not easy
4839837 with his knowledge weve got a lot of young pitchers on our staff hes been helping anyway so thats a good thing
4839838 he tried to pitch through it a couple of times but you could tell you could see it because he uses his legs a lot
4839839 he said it depends how my body reacts as to when he returns he said it usually takes two or three weeks but were going to wait a week get treatment and see how i feel i hope i can come back earlier than two weeks
4839840 hes going to give it a week but weve only got about two weeks of the season left
4839841 we might have to bite the bullet its not something where hes going to injure himself permanently but if its painful then obviously he cant do it
4839842 and if he cant do it well just have to go with what weve got weve got a lot of young pitchers and a lot of young hitters too we dont have the experience a lot of these other teams have
4839843 i dont need to push him i want to get him healthy well see

4839863 either enter jordan without religious objects or go back to israel
4839864 they seemed to know exactly what they were looking for
4839865 it was very demeaning to have such a negative experience in what is billed as a friendly country people in the group including the tour guides were quite shocked no one had ever heard that jordan imposed religious restrictions
4839866 what made it worse was that the whole thing seemed to be directed solely at jews i saw christians walking through into jordan openly wearing crosses apparently christian religious symbols did not seem to be a problem for the jordanians i can well imagine the international outcry if islamic tourists were to encounter such restrictions on their entry into israel
4839867 the jordanian security authorities are responsible for the safety of all visitors to the kingdom and it is our duty to take all measures required in this regard
4839868 the vast majority of the group decided that as proud israelis we were either going to be allowed to walk into jordan holding our religious objects or we would not go in at all

4839944 we are using native plants and grasses identified in an 1819 land survey to return the site to the way it was then a haven for birds mammals amphibians reptiles and insects
4839945 im not afraid here now and there was a time when i was very afraid
4839946 i think fernald is a good model for other sites
4839947 a plan was developed that the community was comfortable with and that didnt push all of the waste into someone elses backyard but that recognized the need for monitoring the site in the future
4839948 summer is butter on your chin and corn mush between every tooth
4839949 our plan is not an evil plan and we are not trying to terrorize the people who love the badlands
4839950 we need this and we have a legal right to it
4839951 its going to alter the whole feel of the area if this road goes through
4839952 were very concerned about the soundscape and any potential visual intrusion and dust
4839953 a lot of folks are very supportive of it and would like the benefit of shaving 90 to 100 miles off their commute
4839954 locals are all for it but i wonder how heavy they federal officials will weigh it in a county losing population
4839955 its not like we just threw a dart this is not only the logical location but the only place that is feasible because of terrain
4839956 otherwise wed have to plow through 6 miles of untouched badlands
4839957 we see it as the cradle of conservation where the concept of conservation started in this country
4839958 you cannot negotiate anything about final status if you dont talk about jerusalem final status consists primarily i believe of jerusalem and refugees if you want to postpone jerusalem you postpone refugees really you are not dealing with the problem you have to discuss these issues and that is exactly where the trade off has to be made
4839959 i still favor a two state solution and will continue to do so but to the extent that you discover its not practical anymore or that its not going to happen you start to think about what the alternatives are
4839960 but on the other hand if we are looking at what is happening on the ground in israel and the occupied territories you see things happening in the opposite direction as if they are not connected to reality thought is running in one direction reality in the other
4839961 we can fight for equal rights rights of existence return and equality and we could take it slowly over the years and there could be a peaceful movement like in south africa
4839962 i think one should maybe begin on the palestinian side to begin a debate to reengage in the idea of one state
4839963 it so happens that fatah in particular the mainstream party and the only viable alternative to extremes on the left or on the right now needs a strategy an ideology
4839964 these are isolated incidents but they do reflect a major sickness in our jerusalem arab society
4839965 what is the driving force behind a two state solution the fact that it seems more acceptable to a majority of people on both sides and therefore more applicable the primary motivation is to minimize human suffering this is what we should all be looking at if there will be a one state solution it will not come today or tomorrow its a long protracted thing not the ideal solution unless in an ideal world people really want to be together then it is the ideal solution the best solution the one that causes the least pain and that can actually be instrumental to a one state solution is to have peace now and acceptance of one another on the basis of two states
4839966 fifty 100 200 years down the road there will be some kind of conclusion sometime in the future however far away this future is i believe well be living at peace with one another in some way or another i am not sure how whether in one state or two states or in a confederation of states but people finally will come to live at peace in the meantime we will simply cause pain to one another its tragic it is very tragic because we know we can do it now that today it is possible with some guts leadership vision we can make it happen today we can reach a peaceful solution today the arab peace initiative proposed in 2002 is a fantastic chance the palestinians have adopted it theyll go with it all the way it is a perfect chance it doesnt even mention right of return it is even better than the ayalon nusseibeh plan but i am willing to accept it
4839967 because for israel however important jerusalem may be the primary factor is the jewish character of the state
4839968 the facts on the ground are making the situation irreversible
4839969 take the clinton parameters palestinian neighborhoods are palestinian sovereignty jewish neighborhoods are jewish sovereignty they are acceptable in principle but with realities on the ground like the expulsion of arab families from their homes in the sheikh jarrah neighborhood and the inhabitation of those areas by jewish settlers its going to be unacceptable on a practical level thats why we dont have time
4839970 ramallahs reaction was a bit worried they called me a few times a bit worried
4839971 we have a terrible situation our political bible our platform our moral values we need to be brought together again if not for creating a state then for our own sanity and for own values as a people apart from in ramallah everybody is living under very bad conditions the occupation is terrible the siege is everywhere pressure as it is the europeans are financing the occupation and the europeans are happy because they feel theyre doing something it cleans their conscience and the israelis are happy because theyre not paying for it and the palestinians are happy because they are getting their wages paid it keeps the economy going and people are getting complacent about it its dead money going after dead money
4839972 i said i want to tell you what you can do to transform yourself from a payer into a player make your money payments conditional on tangible progress in the peace process
4839973 i was in brussels i gave a talk and i said to the europeans if you want to pass on money do it only on the condition we build a state in which case it makes sense for you to spend money to build us an international airport but if in the end there isnt going to be an independent palestinian state why waste your money waste your money if you need to on integrating us into israeli society makes more sense pay the money for us to become part of israel to have equal rights raise our level of education bring our standards of living up but to have the pa taking all this money creating all this debt makes no sense maybe the europeans should link the aid they are giving us to real progress in peace talks so that both the israelis and the palestinians will be shocked out of their complacency or lack of commitment
4839974 the pa has no use if we fail to reach a peace agreement by the end of this year i believe it would be best to go back to the period when we were living happily under occupation we had a small civil administration they were paying back some 20 million a year to the israeli treasury so they were making money off us today we are creating year after year bigger deficits we are spending billions we have 160 000 employees half of them are security personnel who give us no security whatsoever we are spending masses of money on guns which we only use against each other and which provide us no security the whole thing is a mess
4839975 people in jerusalem why should they attach themselves to the muqata to ramallah
4839976 i was still hoping because before he went to the labor party he came and spoke to me i like this about him i knew what he was doing people were pushing him for a long time trying to get him into the system and he resisted but then at one stage i think he made up his mind maybe i can lead the labor party and then this is the best place for me to be i said fine do it i was unhappy that he became marginalized as minister without portfolio
4839977 would come to the palestinian people and say i initialed such a document
4839978 i believe that on israeli side olmert could do the same we dont know whether both leaders will be reelected but its worth doing even if theyre not because at least we know weve given this peace agreement a chance
4839979 i agree with sari nusseibeh that time is running out for the two state solution
4839980 i share his view that olmert missed a chance to get an agreement due to efforts to insure his own political survival the labor party will not succeed in getting back in power by attacking the other parties but only by raising the common banner of security and political agreements
