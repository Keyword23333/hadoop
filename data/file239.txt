2390041 we are ready for a fight to control the scientific high ground
2390042 organizers feel that listening to concerns of the community that youre going into is something that we need to do because one of our biggest problems with the government is that they dont listen to us

2390056 were going to vote with our feet and were going to vote in the streets
2390057 were going to take our marches right to the gates of the pepsi center and were going to push the limits of that security zone because sooner or later at some time or another americans need to start resisting and say no enough is enough
2390058 the regrettable thing is courts are deferring to security planners who base their plans many times on risks that are extremely speculative and the result is all of our first amendment rights are diminished

2390072 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2390073 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2390074 is a reflection of the extraordinary pressures at work in the housing and mortgage markets
2390075 our second quarter results reflect challenging conditions in the housing and mortgage markets that began in 2006 and have deepened through 2007 and 2008

2390100 it was such a huge jump in price that we started hearing more and more that people were taking buses and trains
2390101 the united states has been a very car oriented country for a long time to get people to change their behavior there had to be a really good reason
2390102 we are behind the curve in that costs have gone up dramatically in that time
2390103 its kind of like learning how to swim you just have to jump in
2390104 you have to get used to sharing your space because on a train youre going to be face to face back to back body to body with a whole lot of people

2390123 pride indeed is the cardinal vice it swings open the door to most of the other theological vices and undermines the classical virtues of prudence courage and justice it thrives not on what one has but on what others do not have and even when one has diligently practiced the most admirable virtues there always lurks the danger that at some moment one will look in the mirror and say oh my what a wonderful person i am thus does the vice lunge from its hiding place
2390124 the united states did not go to war in iraq solely because of wmd in my view i doubt it was even the principal cause yet it was the public face that was put on it
2390125 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted especially towards women he has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer

2390133 these new schools and improvements to existing campuses directly affect how we deliver curriculum to our kids and we must stay competitive

2390156 why are the nz commentators so substandard surely they could have done a bit of research into chinese history and given us viewers some decent information during the opening ceremony instead of seemingly made up nonsense they were blurting out

2390161 in the past people have only had the option of tv one on analogue coverage and it is pretty comprehensive we are running from 12 midday to 2 oclock in the morning so its not as if you cant find all the best bits on tv one
2390162 but if for instance you have a particular interest in a minority sport you can chase it through the tvnz co nz website because they have a schedule of every event that is related to that sport and in many cases there will be coverage on one of the online channels

2390480 what started us looking at this issue is the fact that senator mccain has declared his intention to maintain us forces in iraq for a hundred years
2390481 that means that mccain wants to control babylon for at least a century
2390482 we believe that the end times is near based on the pattern of wars earthquakes and other strange phenomena weve been witnessing since the start of the new millennium
2390483 given that it may be imminent the person who controls babylon must be the antichrist
2390484 as far as were concerned that was enough it means that mccain might easily pretend to be the redeemer
2390485 many people think that the antichrist will be a evil seeming leader but in fact the bible tells us that he will be charming
2390486 i have rented to people that ive blacklisted before but only if i know that the circumstances of their lives have changed they are no longer with a self destructive significant other they are no longer self destructive themselves they have paid for any past due rent or damages and matured and gotten a job

2390493 hes much better hes a lot easier to train he once was the most amorous in the barn
2390494 dont go ahead with that until we talk about it
2390495 i know god wont give me more than i can handle sometimes i just wish he didnt trust me so much
2390496 i thought theyd go hard the first bit so i decided to go back

2390618 for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
2390619 although ive been aware from the start that my books might offend some people ive never been afraid of physical harm because of them

2390636 other susceptibility genes for cs and cs like phenotypes must exist
2390637 we hypothesized that sdhx might represent susceptibility genes other than pten for cs cs like syndromes
2390638 our data have important implications for both patient care and genetic counseling i would like to see others independently repeat our observations nonetheless clinicians should consider sdh testing for pten mutation negative cs cs like individuals especially if these individuals have a strong personal history and or family history of breast thyroid or kidney cancer in fact patients with sdhx mutation should be more rigorously screened for these cancers compared to those with pten mutations
2390639 with this study we looked at a very large population to determine how each individual could be stratified based on his or her dna
2390640 we want to see if the snps tied to a specific ancestry hold any biological significance to populations of different origins we want to see if the snps that we isolated are related to natural selection and adaptation for example to the weather conditions of different regions
2390641 because this method is purely computational and leverages linear algebraic methods such as principal components analysis without the use of information on self reported ancestry we were able to treat the data as a black box
2390642 much of the genetic variation was found to stretch between two points what we speculate is the northern european to southern european ancestry axis

2390690 any of the various procedures including the prescription and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
2390691 it makes sense when radish garnishes run 30 a bunch to grow your own produce
2390692 if the timing is off the brain wont set up its circuits properly
2390693 the eyes are ready and seeing properly you can rewire now
2390694 the eye is telling the brain when to become plastic rather than the brain developing on its own clock
2390695 the idea that this class of molecular messenger is passed from cell to cell is considered unorthodox in cell biology
2390696 early excitatory input is important to make first contacts between neurons
2390697 the nervous system is recycling an embryonic factor to induce brain plasticity
2390698 them yet they put up that front as if theyre better than you
2390699 brown carbon spheres in east asian outflow and their optical properties
2390700 because of the large uncertainty we have in the radiative forcing of aerosols there is a corresponding large uncertainty in the degree of radiative forcing overall
2390701 this introduces a large uncertainty in the degree of warming predicted by climate change models
2390702 if we know the optical properties and distribution of all the aerosols over the entire atmosphere then we can produce climate change models that provide more accurate prediction
2390703 the problem with this approach is that it gives the average properties of all aerosol components and at only a few wavelengths of light
2390704 we have used this approach to determine the complete optical properties of individual brown carbon nanoparticles sampled from above the yellow sea during a large international climate change experiment
2390705 this is the first time anyone has determined the complete optical properties of single nanoparticles from the atmosphere
2390706 we show that many of the carbons in our sample have optical properties that are different from those usually assumed in climate models
2390707 when you hear about predictions of future warming or changes in precipitation globally or in specific regions like the southwestern united states the predictions are based on computer model output that is ignoring brown carbon so they are going to tend to be less accurate
2390708 the size of organisms tends to be constrained by a scaling principle scientists call surface to volume ratio
2390709 as the organism grows this surface to volume ratio declines in a way this is how nature keeps the sizes of various species in check
2390710 the average size of the prey captured by the colony increased 20 fold as colony size increased from less than 100 to 10 000 spiders
2390711 so even though the number of prey falls sharply as the colony grows the biomass that individual spiders acquire actually increases
2390712 there simply arent enough large insects in those areas to sustain this type of foraging behaviour
2390713 theres a lot of misinformation so thats why this study is so important
2390714 hundreds and hundreds of parents think this works but we need serious evidence
2390715 a lot of children with autism have gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and diarrhea whether these problems are related to brain development is open to question
2390716 there are neurotransmitters and neuroreceptors in the gut that correspond with those in the brain there are some scientific reasons to think that some kids may benefit from this diet
2390717 plays a key role in understanding how electronics work how all sorts of interesting materials behave how light behaves during communication by optical fibers
2390718 when you look at all the technology governed by quantum physics its not unreasonable to assume that if one can apply chaos theory in a meaningful way to quantum systems that will provide new insights new technology new solutions to problems not yet known
2390719 this type of common behavior has been a signature of classically chaotic newtonian systems mostly studied using a computer but it never had been observed in an experimental system that only can be described by quantum mechanics
2390720 when you have a chaotic system that is characterized by extreme randomness it paradoxically can produce ordered behavior after a certain amount of time
2390721 there is strong evidence that is happening here in our experiment
2390722 when things get atom small our notions of being able to put a specific particle in a specific place with a specific speed at a specific time become blurry
2390723 although they are held in place in the crystal structure the spins can interact with each other and change the direction in which theyre pointed in much the same way that magnets interact with each other when brought close together
2390724 somehow despite the fact these spins have very complicated interactions with each other and started out in completely different orientations they end up all moving in the same way after several milliseconds
2390725 thats never been seen before in a quantum mechanical system these guys are dancing together
2390726 never use a verb other than said to carry dialogue
2390727 this is not about a tiny separatist area inside georgia this is not about georgia anymore it is about america its values
2390728 the united states supports georgias territorial integrity and we call for an immediate cease fire
2390729 all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2390730 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2390731 we have a banking crisis and an agency crisis and a mortgage crisis and a coming credit card crisis weve never seen anything like that before and it all seems to be coming home to roost at the same time thats never happened either
2390732 but we did not even have credit cards in the 1930s there were no such thing as student loans
2390733 what ive said is that im playing the hand that was dealt and that my responsibility is to protect the u s economy and the american people

2390735 u s business and hispanic integration expanding the economic contributions of immigrants
2390736 by understanding how master transcription factors turn micrornas on and off we now see how these two groups of gene regulators work together to control the state of the cell
2390737 micrornas are a special class of molecules because they not only contribute to cellular control but they play important roles in disease states such as cancer
2390738 knowing where genes start is essential to understanding their control
2390739 based on our knowledge of microrna gene start sites we were able to discover how these genes are controlled by the master transcription factors
2390740 we now have a list of what micrornas are important in embryonic stem cells
2390741 this gives us clues of which micrornas you might want to target to direct an embryonic stem cell into another type of cell for example you might be able to harness a microrna to help drive an embryonic stem cell to become a neuron aiding with neurodegenerative disease or spinal cord injury
2390742 we and others are finding that the overall gene circuitry for embryonic stem cells and cancer cells is very similar
2390743 now that we have connected the circuitry to micrornas we can begin to compare micrornas that are regulated in embryonic stem cells to those in cancer cells
2390744 we are privileged and honored that our city is one of the four venues in the torre and so one on one duel

2390754 so im talking to you stooge as the igg told me to
2390755 they tried to steal the show thing is d b you cant steal the show from the igg and the gib cant be done

2390761 it is clear that our health care system isnt giving americans the health care they need and deserve
2390762 the disorganization and inefficiency are affecting americans in their everyday lives and its obvious that people are looking for reform with the upcoming election there is great opportunity for our leaders to hear what the american people are saying they want from a health care system and to respond with meaningful proposals
2390763 there is no one policy or practice that will make our health care system run like an efficient well oiled machine
2390764 this is going to take strong national leadership and a commitment from all of the players in our health care system but with that and the strategies outlined in this report real progress could be made

2390770 i tell you that if these keep silent the very stones will cry out
2390771 you know something mom i come here and your home is so comfortable but it doesnt feel like home i go to hollys but it doesnt feel like home i go to my house and it doesnt feel like home i dont feel like any place is home do you know what i mean
2390772 thats because your home is not on this earth honey you are just passing through here your home is in heaven and really no matter how comfortable we make our earthly surroundings nothing satisfies us we long for heaven

2390782 but the e drive has the program im having trouble with on it this new box is hosed because this software was written by hypochondriacs and wont install right unless you actually buy a hoop and jump through it while you type in the serial number
2390783 so dig through the registry and remove all references to it
2390784 one i already tried that and two even if i hadnt my answer would still be no

2390792 when i learned i was pregnant the first thing i did was call my mother
2390793 the second thing i did was establish an instant messenger account with windows live messenger so i could stay connected with my family and friends it was important for me to share all of the moments i was beginning to experience as an expecting mom
2390794 i have friends and family spread out across the country and windows live messenger allows me to keep them up to date on whats happening in my life
2390795 everyone loves the webcam i have on my computer it links into my messenger account and lets me send real time videos of my little one as he starts to walk talk and grow

2390801 i think its very important as this government continues to move in the direction of increased revenues as a result of the growing economy that we use the additional revenues into the government to pay our past due obligations and reduce our deficit

2390823 what we really want to protect is the natural phenomenon of abundance

2390827 implies a need for a more extensive reserve system and more constraints on blocking developments than someone focused mainly on resident species and breeding habitats might have envisaged
2390828 its easy to envision a situation where you have a choice between conserving an important stopover habitat or growing food or biofuel on it
2390829 south east asia has plummeted to levels it took europe 150 years to reach in just 30 years
2390830 the span of fertility across countries has never been wider
2390831 both extremes cause their own problems if europe continues at 1 5 the population will halve every 65 years if africa continues with half its population under 15 it will continue to consume more than it produces making it harder to escape from poverty and illiteracy
2390832 if i were a gambler i would take even money that england will not exist in the year 2000
2390833 people are very bad at calculating survival probabilities twenty years ago fertility started to decline in nepal and bangladesh when they were still poor korea wasnt rich when fertility declined by contrast the gulf oil states continued with high birthrates long after they got huge wealth
2390834 theres been an extraordinary change in 20 years and it comes from a combination of factors
2390835 they have had 5 to 6 per cent economic growth over the past 15 years and in areas like the textile industry that provides work for lots of ordinary people a woman can earn 25 30 a month in a garment factory thats big money and if you have two daughters working it is delaying the age at which women marry it used to be 14 or 15 now its 21 or 22 another factor is the success of ngos non governmental organisations 20 million households in bangladesh have access to micro finance and in half of them the money goes to the women then there has been education for girls encouraged by programmes that gave cereals to families whose girls went to secondary school and cash for education female stipends
2390836 in africa most women work in agriculture around the home
2390837 but in bangladesh women get out and meet other women at work who may be using contraception getting outside the home fixes a new social norm prosperity and fertility are interlinked in a chicken and egg way
2390838 food sex and procreation are core elements of humanity and changes to them are often met with fierce hostility
2390839 in my view the evidence is that there is something intrinsic to the culture its there in the rich muslim states in the gulf in saudi arabia and in the muslim provinces of the former soviet union it is perhaps bound up with the status of women
2390840 not just in catholic spain and italy but in orthodox greece the strong traditions are not boosting fertility rate as many might suppose
2390841 many women in the developed world will become overloaded and respond by cutting down the number of children they have
2390842 the overall emission of the pollutants in beijing has remarkably decreased
2390843 actually in the summer in beijing we have sunny days cloudy days and hazy days as well in beijing
2390844 since people are paying very much attention on the air quality you must also pay attention on pollutions emission reduction ever since july we adopted temporary emission reduction measures in beijing we have every reason to say that today the emission reduction is very much lower than the ordinary level in beijing
2390845 beijing municipal government has taken 13 stages of steps and more than 200 measures to reduce the pollutant emission from the motor vehicles coal fire units construction sites and the industrial pollution sites
2390846 the days meeting the relevant standard has increased from 100 to 246 days
2390847 since july 1 measures to improve air quality conditions have been implemented including the specific traffic control for the motor vehicles shut down the heavily polluting industries and construction sites
2390848 with these efforts the emission was greatly reduced by 30 percent
2390849 the fog you see is based on humidity and heat there can be pollution but the fog is not necessarily pollution
2390850 i am only doing what i perceive as best for my health and upcoming competition
2390851 i nor any of the other athletes involved were attempting to make a political statement of any sort we meant no offense to the great host the chinese have been and all appreciate the hard work and devotion theyve displayed to provide this venue
2390852 i will continue to wear my mask where i deem fit its my life and health in the long run and i would never do something that would purposefully or intently harm the best interest or the public view of either my country or other countries in attendance
2390853 its just a precautionary measure for the best performance come game day
2390854 dll32 error would start popping up after that my computer would just reboot it was a mess cleaning the registry actually allowed me to use my computer normally very joyous day that was

2390856 were all ecstatic about the results on the legislation passed on the new raises for law enforcement across the board
2390857 i think the islands going to see a more productive a more spirited and a more motivated law enforcement workforce
2390858 from what i understand the way the bill works is that were going to be getting 10 at the beginning of the new fiscal year and then 10 every year thereafter for the next three years so a total of 40
2390859 youre going to see an increase in services a more productive workforce
2390860 the officers across the board taking more pride in what they do youre going to see an increase in the hiring and retention of officers at all levels
2390861 children arent required to get it every year and thats why we have problems in the guam public school system with kids coming down with tb which spreads instantly throughout the school

2390864 it can almost rob the drier regions of their rainfall
2390865 the key message from an australian perspective is this is not good news
2390866 but all sports have received good numbers in letters but yeah certainly athletics and swimming are leading the way at the moment
2390867 in market parlance they are buying stock that has been beaten down a bit
2390868 this agreement also represents a resounding endorsement of the future of husky athletics
2390869 should not be seen as a precedent or indicator to any future decision in a similar situation
2390870 the victim of the robbery has been advised of this decision police would like to reinforce advice given to all retailers that active resistance in this situation is not encouraged
2390871 the female was subjected to further assaults before being released a short time later
2390872 the victim whilst shaken and upset received only minor injuries
2390873 after these demands were made the complainant was physically assaulted numerous times
2390874 after attacking the complainant the offender searched through the house before leaving with a sum of money

2390878 that was where the real casualties of undercover work came from
2390879 he had real trouble fitting back in to normal society because he had no home to go to nowhere he could just lie on the couch and put his feet up i realised how lucky i was to have a bolthole i could stay with my parents on the family farm play rugby and go possuming
2390880 my views on law and order were shaped by spending my first two or three years in the police not necessarily chasing crooks but dealing with victims of crime and most of those victims live at the poor end of town
2390881 this is what makes me angry the wellington liberals believe you help poor people by disempowering police what they fail to understand is that the people who lose when police become tentative or weak are the good people who live in the poor areas
2390882 the community cant shut down the local tinny house only the coercive arm of the state can do that
2390883 the police lost control of the agenda because law and order was becoming a hot political potato
2390884 the message from the academics was that community policing couldnt be just an add on to conventional policing it had to be an instead of that was the huge mistake they made
2390885 all the heads of departments finance public relations hr are civilians with no policing experience

2390894 oh thats interesting that you dont have any red in your design
2390895 i cant imagine adidas will be too happy at paying all that money to sponsor the games only to see a rival stepping up to light the olympic flame
2390896 deliberate disruptions who gave no thought to the olympic spirit or the laws of britain and france
2390897 we will have to reflect with calmness and tranquility on the future of the olympic torch relay
2390898 we respect protests and freedom of expression but violence is against the olympic spirit
2390899 we believe in the strong symbolism of the torch relay
2390900 it is illusory to think the simple elimination of the international relay will make all the problems disappear
2390901 the torch relay attracts the media and the media attracts the protesters to make it only a national relay will not solve all the problems
2390902 after these incidents we are convinced more than ever that we need to cherish and preserve the flame
2390903 we must make all efforts to make sure these incidents are never repeated again it is a hope i dont know if it will become a reality
2390904 cynical plan to please the bush state department and the chinese government because of the incredible influence of money
2390905 the city of san francisco from a global perspective will be applauded
2390906 we did not know beforehand these thugs were from the security services had i known so we would have said no
2390907 samsung is thrilled to be the presenting partner of the beijing olympic torch relay
2390908 we are extremely proud of the diverse group that will have the honor of carrying the olympic flame at this historic event the torchbearers reflect what is best in all of us and also samsungs corporate values of harmony and shared humanity in particular the torch relay in china will enhance the understanding and friendship between samsung and the chinese people
2390909 the olympic torch relay is truly a magnificent event and coca cola is proud to be involved again for the beijing 2008 olympic games
2390910 the torch relay builds awareness and anticipation for the upcoming olympic games and it has become a symbol of optimism that connects people across different cultures
2390911 at this point it is as if you are sponsoring political and social conflict rather than celebrating peace and unification
2390912 lenovo is proud to play a role in spreading the important values the olympic games embody unity peace and sponsorship
2390913 understandably we are disappointed by attempts to disrupt the relay
2390914 the olympics dont exist in a vacuum you cant just cherry pick the profitable parts
2390915 they need to position themselves as part of the solution
2390916 the olympics should not be used as a platform for political issues

2390948 i think the old standby of avatar capital punishment has gone on long enough theres plenty of unexplored territory in the medium of videogames and this convention is getting in the way
2390949 after all as soon as you remove the keystone that equates death with failure in videogames the whole structure thats existed since spacewar will crumble is that such a bad thing
2390950 i fantasize about a mobster game that doesnt thrive on body counts but still harbors a violent subtext maybe theres an occasional shootout and if the player fails the avatars friend dives in to take the bullet you would feel the consequences for the rest of the game and youd learn not to make the same mistake twice

2391029 is this another skeleton in the democratic closet that barack obama must struggle to overcome
2391030 i wanted this to have the banter i wanted this to be funny
2391031 hes cocky like han he can do a lot of things like han hes clever with machines like han but hes naive like luke the whole galaxy is a bit overwhelming
2391032 she definitely brings a fun side out of anakin i think they have such a great relationship
2391033 ahsoka is very eager to prove herself and i dont think she would allow anakin not to accept her
2391034 i was hoping id never have to lay eyes on this dustball again
2391035 with this movie and also the ongoing series were going to see the banter between obi wan and anakin were going to see them as comrades as buddies
2391036 it is reminiscent of some of the original star wars its got that comic relief in it and has kind of that old school feeling
2391037 that was the impetus of that this whole period of time we could run around in

2391041 he hasnt been back to linsly recently but he has kept in contact throughout the years
2391042 but we need to get the project completed we are working with the surety company and our goal is to get the project completed as soon as possible then we will address outstanding accountability and follow up issues
2391043 have always been about transparency and accountability not only with regard to the wheeling tunnel project but with every project we are involved with
2391044 obviously there are disagreements between the contractor and the state however we have agreed to resume work on the project and deal with those outstanding issues after the tunnel work is completed anytime there are disagreements between two parties there are ways to handle them either by mediation or in court they will be handled through that process and no other
2391045 we must investigate how the job specifications are written and make sure we dont make the same mistakes on the westbound side it may be necessary to send a resolution to our federal delegation urging them to place low bidder exemptions on specialized projects such as bridges and tunnels
2391046 before it is finished we will know fully what went wrong if anything at least the highways department will learn from this experience and factor that knowledge into the westbound bid specifications
2391047 last year i made a formal request to the highway department to submit to an investigation by a joint committee of the legislature their response was that we delay an investigation because any testimony presented to the committee could be used in civil court proceedings
2391048 i go to 14 different blues festivals every year and this is one of the two best i get to see
2391049 i have met so many new friends here and i support everything that bruce wheeler has been able to do with this show
2391050 this is really a large crowd and i expect to see even more people here on saturday
2391051 we had clumps of mud clear behind our stage but the city did an excellent job of getting it cleaned up in time for the festival
2391052 the music is just wonderful and the atmosphere is very relaxing
2391053 this is my first time here and i just love it
2391054 someone gave me a free ticket two years ago so i came down and thought i would only be here about 20 minutes but i ended up coming all three days because i did not know how much i liked the blues
2391055 there is a lot of work to be done in terms of removing the old material filling the hole and paving the street
2391056 our first priority is to get the waterline repaired once we get that completed the entire road surface will be evaluated before we repair it
2391057 a 20 inch water main break is significant because of the amount of water involved
2391058 whenever you have old waterlines like we do these kinds of things are going to happen and we just have to deal with them as they come along the west virginia division of highways was here to observe the damage they agreed to detour the traffic onto market street for the time being

2391065 bill clinton says that barack obama may not be ready to be president
2391066 y ou could argue that no one is ever ready to be president
2391067 i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in my first year
2391068 i think saying that you are the a citizen of the world talking to 200 000 germans is very dangerous because the average american does not want to elect a president of the world
2391069 a citizen a proud citizen of the united states and a fellow citizen of the world
2391070 h is plan is to raise your taxes and spend more of your money
2391071 n ature cleaned it up faster than we ever could

2391074 steamy hot pile of crap wedged between two pieces of bread
2391075 i never hear the inspiring where is the inspiring rhetoric about how great this country is i never hear him talk about that
2391076 hope is the bedrock of this nation the belief that our destiny will not be written for us but by us by all those men and women who are not content to settle for the world as it is who have the courage to remake the world as it should be
2391077 believe the quote was correct as written and that this supposed context is a recreation after the fact by democratic aides who were worried about how the quote looked
2391078 is this another skeleton in the democratic closet that barack obama must struggle to overcome
2391079 the fact that man knows right from wrong proves his intellectual superiority to other creatures but the fact that he can do wrong proves his moral inferiority to any creature that cannot
2391080 look at that guy upside down on his chair i can do that i can do that
2391081 dude me and jon came up with the best idea

2391085 mh hm how better to hurt you than to hurt me

2391100 theyre not new youve always had wings brendon is this some kind of weird joke
2391101 ha ha ha guess what im a fairy ha ha
2391102 so thats where you got your brown eyes and also your wings
2391103 is that some kind of fairy code youre not supposed to talk about another dudes wings
2391104 this is why humans arent supposed to be able to see them
2391105 i guess like theres some kind of fairy magic spencer stop laughing or im not going to tell you any more
2391106 i guess that humans and fairies didnt get along too well so theres some kind of like a spell or something that made it so that humans cant see fairies or you know
2391107 not really one of my sisters sort of not steals but you know other peoples dreams like when she sleeps she sees their dreams that was embarrassing when i was a teenager let me tell you it kind of comes and goes my nephew can kind of hover in the air right now but were pretty sure that his wings arent going to keep growing with his body so he wont be able to for much longer when i was a kid i never really needed to sleep but now
2391108 the woman wouldnt know that the guy was a fairy and then all of the sudden she has a baby with wings or strangely colored eyes or whatever its not that someone stole her real baby that was just you know what her baby was like
2391109 how come im the only one who can see them
2391110 is that an especially human like shirt that doesnt know your wings exist
2391111 its just dust you know like how theres oil to protect human skin theres dust to protect fairy wings
2391112 you know that youve seen what happens when ryan or jon sit on them or whatever
2391113 and i dont want i mean its just a really weird cold feeling when peoples hands pass through it kind of creeps me out
2391114 its all soft its like that body powder that my mom uses
2391115 like you said no one else can see its all over you too
2391116 i went outside to take the call and then i ended up wandering back to the bus
2391117 i sent a present and i called and stuff on the day she had the birthday party for him tonight so she was just calling to complain about the other parents
2391118 thats the only part of touring that gets to me
2391119 cmon lets get back to the party alex bought a mandolin and i bet hell let you try it if you ask nicely
2391120 ill even help you find some vodka to mix with your red bull
2391121 i thought you said that people couldnt touch your wings
2391122 maybe if you if you you could just i think
2391123 and then the humans arent able to they cant touch unless they feel you couldnt touch them unless you felt
2391124 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen

2391136 i like the organization this is where i want to be
2391137 it is not the business of christchurch city council to use ratepayer money for private sector property development and certainly not to bail out private sector developers
2391138 flower shows commercial property development what next tell you what why doesnt the council buy my house for a ridiculous price i think im moving out of state
2391139 in the meantime its enough to make me vote libertarianz and end the unholy power that local government has been given along with my line of credit on a plate
2391140 it started with people looking in the window and making comments outside and they told me their points of view that they found it offensive other shop traders also told me that people were saying to them that it was offensive and that i should cover her up or move her so i put a camisole on emily and someone else made another comment saying that they could still see the bump so i put her in the corner of the shop away from the window
2391141 golf is assuredly a mystifying game it would seem that if a person has hit a golf ball correctly a thousand times he should be able to duplicate the performance at will but this is certainly not the case
2391142 im not home a lot so michelle is usually willing to give it up
2391143 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars

2391150 sure it is possible to have too little government except that has not been the worlds problem for millennia
2391151 do you have any idea how many contradictions there are in the bible
2391152 whenever i get around to it which might be tonight
2391153 all the actuaries all the objective scorekeepers of the federal government are predicting this
2391154 they say we are 53 trillion short of fulfilling the promises the government is making to the american people in todays dollars
2391155 meaning that if we want to keep the promises of medicare medicaid and social security which are basically the three major entitlement programs today we would have to set aside 53 trillion dollars and invest them at treasury rates in order to do it
2391156 for the last 40 years the federal government has had to tax every dollar made in america at 18 3 cents on that dollar to pay the bills of the federal government
2391157 by the time my three children who are three five and six years old are my age the federal government will have to tax 40 cents out of every dollar made in america just to pay the bills for the federal government at that time
2391158 they said that the current low rate the 10 percent bracket for low income americans would have to go up to 25 percent the middle income tax rate for middle income americans would have to go up to 66 percent and the top rate which is what small businesses pay would have to go to 88 percent
2391159 those would be the tax rates you would have to have if you wanted to tax your way out of this problem
2391160 and if you did that all experts conclude you would literally crash the american economy
2391161 the legacy of this country has always been that each generation confronts the challenges before it so that the next generation is better off
2391162 in the past we brought down the iron curtain and won the cold war we got through world war i we got through world war ii we won the war on the great depression
2391163 the problem that we have right now putting foreign policy aside and our fight with islamic radicalism is that we have an economic crisis we have a fiscal crisis and that is we will bankrupt this country and the best century in america will be the last century
2391164 unless we turn our fiscal situation around and pay off this debt and change the way these programs work to a more sustainable path the next generation will have inferior living standards
2391165 if you dont make a vote for the war your against the troops amp your un american

2391172 in an unusually tight election year the clergy are becoming an increasingly important bridge to the faithful and the votes they can deliver on nov 2 sen john kerry has hired a director of religious outreach making him one of the few democratic candidates ever to do so on the bush side the republican national committee is mounting a catholic outreach tour while white house strategist karl rove has turned to the rev richard land a leading southern baptist for feedback on the proposed same sex marriage amendment and stem cell research much of the activity is taking place out of view for strategic reasons basically neither candidate wants to show his hand

2391196 i think that the biocontrol is probably the best in the county because it is environmentally safe and they will virtually go everyplace and take it out once they get established the biggest probelm with biocontrol is they only control the existing plant
2391197 the best control is done locally first and then the county weed board can give that person a notice to control the county weed board can assesss apenalty on that producer and manager they can actually spray the weed and assess the cost of that control on the land and it is like part of their land taxes
2391198 it is complaint driven so what might happen is on the county level we encourage people we have programs to cost share pesticide use they can get that through their county weed officer so we encourage them first to control it themselves

2391209 few muslim converts of caribbean origin have popped up in key roles
2391210 six of the people arrested live in my community in hackney
2391211 even though they may only be a handful i will not be surprised to see other young men of caribbean origin involved
2391212 these young men obviously need something to believe in and radical islam gives them this
2391213 the leftist elite and islamists it suggested use some of the same talking points revolving around dark conspiracy theories and loathsome broadsides against america israel and even western culture
2391214 the war aims are above all to secure iraqs oil for the us oil companies that put george w bush in the white house
2391215 i have no doubt that what israel is doing in lebanon is a war crime
2391216 there are no excuses for terrorism but there is a political context politicians have to acknowledge that british and american foreign policy in relation to palestine afghanistan iraq and the middle east have sic embittered muslims around the world
2391217 an all too willing conduit for anti jewish and anti israel poison and propaganda
2391218 quite different from the us black muslims or the muslim faith as practiced in parts of africa
2391219 the british media love to play up the caribbean origins of any terrorist suspects even though they may be british citizens associating black men with terrorist violence is obviously irresistible

2391256 i prefer someone in your paper would just say it the way it is
2391257 is our faithful attempt to create a world in which no one is trampled underfoot

2391259 hey i give a f k about the less fortunate
2391260 the people who do the dirty work on the ground
2391261 some people say its a bee but what do you think is it an ant
2391262 i havent even gone to see whats inside the new museum
2391263 the city created the museum with grants subsidised by the nuclear facilities up there
2391264 the project has nothing to do with local residents like us
2391265 some people in the city administration are simply doing what they feel like doing
2391266 we are aware of the criticism that the city spends money for the sake of spending
2391267 but we believe that this is an investment in the future increasing peoples awareness of arts and culture
2391268 the quality is far more superb than we had expected
2391269 i hear many visitors here are from outside the province but i hope people in the city realise what a great asset they have
2391270 towada is a city of farmers the economy here has been bad because farmers cannot make enough money
2391271 the situation got even worse since the time of koizumi
2391272 im sure the artwork is great and making the main street a wonderful place
2391273 but old folks here are wondering why the city spends so much money on such things
2391274 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

2391277 the dept is going to take a greater role in immigration judges hiring
2391278 emphasized that she wanted us to know that this is coming from the ag john ashcroft
2391279 many lawyers seeking positions within the administration including judgeships become known to the white house offices of political affairs presidential personnel and counsel to the president
2391280 identify their political party affiliation their voting address for 2000 and 2004 involvement in the bush cheney campaigns of 2000 and 2004 and a point of contact to verify their involvement in the campaigns
2391281 contact the white house to get any candidate ideas that they had for immigration judges
2391282 contained a search string and stated this is the lexis nexis search string that i use for ag appointments
2391283 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2391284 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2391285 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2391286 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2391287 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2391288 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false

2391292 liverpool have the best chance theyve had in a long time
2391293 the introduction of robbie keane makes them stronger instantly but for the first time theyve got a nice balance liverpool will be a lot closer this time they were 21 points adrift two years ago 11 points last year this is their most realistic chance they were strong at home and i expect them to do a lot better and get closer and challenge
2391294 im confident theyll do well but i dont think theyll win the league i think they are closer to the top but it will still be between manchester united and chelsea they are the favourites at one point we were 30 odd points off the top but last season they were only 11 off you have to be realistic and i think getting closer to the top and finishing third would be a success

2391297 this is a tremendous victory for the nurses at providence medford medical center throughout this struggle they have demonstrated extraordinary dedication to their community and quality patient care winning a union through ona is an important step towards improving nurses ability to advocate for patients
2391298 the nurse led system of organizing is really unique to ona in oregon
2391299 at ona we respond to requests from nurses who recognize the value of union representation at pmmc we were invited to do this work which makes the whole process democratic and grassroots
2391300 we have taken the first major step toward making the voice of nurses heard now we have the chance to focus our energy on providing safe and quality care for our community and ensuring that patients nurses and all staff are treated with providences core values
2391301 nurses joining together is a remarkable and powerful way to ensure the delivery of the highest quality health care for a community the nursing professionals at pmmc along with their more than 11 500 colleagues across the state who are also represented by ona have the power and influence to make positive change at their facilities for the benefit of patients and staff this is a great day for nurses and for medford

2391305 my brothers never ask anybody to dinner im sure when theyve got such a nice piece of mutton as this and nobody else has got so much as a piece of dry bread it would do their hearts good to have somebody to eat it with them

2391327 it is a good knaves trade we can put a great deal of copper into the gold without anyones finding it out
2391328 if that river were really all gold what a nice thing it would be
2391329 i am the king of what you mortals call the golden river the shape you saw me in was owing to the malice of a stronger king from whose enchantments you have this instant freed me what i have seen of you and your conduct to your wicked brothers renders me willing to serve you therefore attend to what i tell you whoever shall climb to the top of that mountain from which you see the golden river issue and shall cast into the stream at its source three drops of holy water for him and for him only the river shall turn to gold but no one failing in his first can succeed in a second attempt and if anyone shall cast unholy water into the river it will overwhelm him and he will become a black stone

2391332 are you there remember the prison bars my boy water indeed do you suppose i carried it all the way up here for you

2391334 i am faint with thirst give me some of that water
2391335 itll be dead when i come down again if i dont help it
2391336 instead of sending me those rascally brothers of yours for me to have the trouble of turning into stones very hard stones they make too
2391337 they poured unholy water into my stream do you suppose im going to allow that
2391338 i am sure sir your majesty i mean they got the water out of the church font
2391339 the water which has been refused to the cry of the weary and dying is unholy though it had been blessed by every saint in heaven and the water which is found in the vessel of mercy is holy though it had been defiled with corpses

2391351 we should be thanking putin for closing the pipelines to ukraine last january which has brought us here to talk about energy

2391361 ask any seemingly cosmopolitan russians on a downtown moscow street about their take on the international scandal they will most likely shrug and suggest that the former spy alexander litvinenko poisoned himself just to make russian president vladimir putin look bad
2391362 okay heres the plan sechin i want you to kill politkovskaya i know its true that her articles have almost no effect on our policies in chechnya and are ignored by all but a small percentage of liberal russians but so what oo she makes me so angry once shes out of the way my grip on power will finally be secured mwah hah hah but wait thats not all oh no im much more dastardly than that see im not asking for much for my birthday sechin forget the bulgari watches that you guys give me every year i want her corpse brought to me with a big red birthday bow tied around it i want to kill her on my birthday just before my big meeting in germany theyll understand after all theyre germans you know nazis just like me deal yeah oh goodie im so deliciously evil even stewie would envy me why this is going to be the best birthday of my life happy birthday to me happy birthday to me
2391363 it is quite possible without performing any detective work to say what is ultimately responsible for these deaths it is the climate of brutality that has flourished under mr putin
2391364 now zakayev is convinced that someone most probably a hired hitman with links to the kremlin is already stalking his movements
2391365 it is an over used word and a controversial one especially in russia it is not there yet but russia sometimes seems to be heading towards fascism

2391368 i have decided to resign in an effort to prevent cnn from being unfairly tarnished by the controversy over conflicting accounts of my recent remarks regarding the alarming number of journalists killed in iraq i never meant to imply u s forces acted with ill intent when u s forces accidentally killed journalists and i apologize to anyone who thought i said or believed otherwise
2391369 sure id like to print something else but i dont want to risk it but the difference is at least we have the right to publish what we want about iraq
2391370 by some estimates there will be an average of two per cent annual growth in global oil demand over the years ahead along with conservatively a three per cent natural decline in production from existing reserves that means by 2010 we will need on the order of an additional fifty million barrels a day so where is the oil going to come from governments and the national oil companies are obviously controlling about ninety per cent of the assets oil remains fundamentally a government business while many regions of the world offer great oil opportunities the middle east with two thirds of the worlds oil and the lowest cost is still where the prize ultimately lies even though companies are anxious for greater access there progress continues to be slow it is true that technology privatisation and the opening up of a number of countries have created many new opportunities in areas around the world for various oil companies but looking back to the early 1990s expectations were that significant amounts of the worlds new resources would come from such areas as the former soviet union and from china of course that didnt turn out quite as expected instead it turned out to be deep water successes that yielded the bonanza of the 1990s

2391386 this is a very effective way to promote diversity of voices and increase competition in the telecommunications industry i support diversity in media ownership because it provides a window into communities languages views and values that might not otherwise be heard without these outlets
2391387 unfortunately we see major news outlets airing too many sensationalist stories on outlandish topics such as immigrants with leprosy black street gangs or mexican plots to re conquer the united states americans should be able to flip to stations where we can hear about asian american ceos revolutionizing their industries african american doctors saving lives and hispanic soldiers many of whom are not yet citizens bravely fighting overseas under the flag of the country theyre proud to call their own

2391389 in the new direction congress democrats have both introduced and now passed legislation to end pay discrimination against women as an early cosponsor of the paycheck fairness act i am delighted that our legislation passed the house today as the father and step father of four daughters i find it outrageous that employers continue to get away with paying women 77 cents for every dollar that a man with the same qualifications in the same job earns and that minority women earn even less than that but this hurts not only a womans daily wage but her retirement savings pension and social security it is detrimental to women and the american economy as a whole

2391416 i might bend my putter to an 18 degree loft tonight maybe thats the way to putt these greens
2391417 i really noticed the first day that it was pretty smoggy we landed on the plane and i think we were all like wow is this weather is this smog is this fog what is it it was kind of surprising to see that
2391418 the air quality i think its good it looks a little bit misty you cannot judge the air quality by its appearance you have to trust the scientists
2391419 i just have the feeling theyre with me all the way
2391420 when i wake up in the morning and look in the mirror this is my challenge
2391421 i want to win on a road course and its the last chance i have this year to do it
2391422 i just want more laps to get in the rhythm of road course racing i seem to have the pace for a handful of laps doing the right thing
2391423 im not sure if its being overaggressive what that really is
2391424 i realized the pros dont hit it any further than i do
2391425 when i hit my driver like i did today this is an easy sport
2391426 i dont think its going to be won by 1 under par
2391427 i just need to make sure that i stay around where i am and maybe a little closer to par thats going to have a chance on sunday
2391428 its the kind of round ive been looking for to get myself back on the leaderboard and feeling the good vibes
2391429 when i got here on tuesday i called home and i said this is the hardest golf course ive ever played
2391430 if i were to play here every day i dont know if i would enjoy it its a very difficult golf course
2391431 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good
2391432 if im hitting bad shots with it you dont hit it as much you hit it right where youve looked whale away
2391433 i think that is going to be one of the most watched games in sports history
2391434 how cool how good is it that were going to play in a game that might be the most viewed game in the history of sport come on
2391435 i remember growing up inner city of chicago shooting at a basket in a schoolyard hoping that one person would watch me and now im going to have a chance to coach my countrys team in front of a billion people are you kidding
2391436 the energy the one thing about these games is that they are shorter games than nba games teams can get hot and stay hot and all of a sudden you find yourselves in a dogfight i think thats a danger you face

2391442 its appalling that this government is handing out raises of up to 100 000 a year apparently to address a recruitment and retention problem when b c is struggling to find enough health care workers to provide quality services to patients residents and clients

2391445 what we need is a comprehensive training and recruitment strategy to ensure that we are able to attract and retain the skilled people needed to deliver health services to british columbians
2391446 what we got is a government that puts the interests of its highest paid executives ahead of b c patients and those who deliver front line care

2391458 the danger of being injured by thrown bats fragments thereof and thrown or batted balls

2391628 when im not at the golf course i try not to think about golf and the kids make it easy we had a few laughs then you go to sleep and wake up and every days different
2391629 if you really knew what i thought about this golf course youd think i could never have a chance of playing well or winning on it
2391630 if you hit in the rough getting on the green is more luck than skill so i understand where the players are coming from but you dont have to like it
2391631 you just have to accept it you have to try hard on every shot hit every shot to the best of your ability and see what happens you just have to avoid the big numbers
2391632 thats how i was able to get back in the british i was 5 over after two holes and 8 over at one point the wind was blowing 40 miles an hour and your hands were numb but why quit just try hard on every shot whos to say whats going to happen
2391633 i lost my head a little bit thursday i was 6 over the last eight holes and it was all mental it was one three putt after another but like i said you wake up and its a different day
2391634 no i think ive proved that i can play out here
2391635 to me thats all that matters if i sit here and think about winning another major ill be thinking about it for the rest of my life
2391636 i know i can win another one its just a matter of taking care of the opportunities that im given there are weeks that you can play your best and not win and there are weeks where you can kind of just stumble your way in and win so you cant think about it i dont have to prove anything to anybody but myself i dont think that if i cant win another major that my career is not fulfilled because it is
2391637 it popped in my head to lay it down in the fairway and hit a shot down there
2391638 if the pin was easier you might have saw a bit more of that but where they put the pin its pretty much impossible you have to try to get up where you can chip on
2391639 just because its a shorter hole doesnt make it a great hole
2391640 when i hit my driver like i did this is an easy sport
2391641 its the kind of round ive been looking for to get myself back on the leader board and feeling the good vibes
2391642 when i got here on tuesday i called home and i said this is the hardest golf course ive ever played
2391643 if i were to play here every day i dont know if i would enjoy it its a very difficult golf course
2391644 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good
2391645 if im hitting bad shots with it you dont hit it as much you hit it right where youve looked whale away

2391675 cristiano has four years left on his contract and at some point hopefully he will extend it
2391676 he is happy at manchester united and hopefully as he gets older he will appreciate being here more and more
2391677 it does happen to players at this club they end up never wanting to leave
2391678 look at rio ferdinand he joined us as a young man from leeds united now he is a real manchester united person he loves the club
2391679 it is no different leaving london for manchester than portugal you come north you come to a colder climate you come to a wetter climate
2391680 but you also come to a real football city there are very few cities like that
2391681 his interview was very good and from my perspective he has explained himself perfectly
2391682 he is happy to be a manchester united player he always has been it is just the unfortunate participation of real madrid in the boys life has made it difficult for him however the matter is now closed
2391683 i think real madrid know they are dealing with a different animal now
2391684 i cant deny it was important for us as a club to keep him
2391685 there are very few players who have left me against my will
2391686 it is unusual for anyone to really want to leave manchester united and i think cristiano understands that too
2391687 we had a good meeting in portugal this summer we clarified a lot of things and i was pleased with the way it went that is why i was confident everything would be okay
2391688 i was nervous in the first three overs when i got hit for a bit but i was confident i would be able to get virender sehwag i had got him in the practice match and i knew i could get him again
2391689 i kept thinking that i want his wicket and worked towards it and i got it i bowled well and i got my reward
2391690 they india have a very good batting line up actually one of the greatest batsmen is tendulkar it was really big moment for me when i got that wicket i am really happy
2391691 he was outstanding once he got the first wicket he was on fire
2391692 prasad is a strong boy and he troubled dravid with his pace he was hitting dravids bat hard and you could see the great man was clearly rattled by the pace
2391693 prasad did a brilliant job he got three crucial wickets on day one on a good batting surface after india decided to bat first
2391694 all she has to do is stand still and look stupid
2391695 im not as strong at math but this may be because my teachers were insensitive and ignorant and they screwed up big time when they were teaching me

2391719 in addition to internet usage growing much faster outside the u s countries that have the strongest purchasing power are also outside the u s like those in the european union
2391720 international purchasers are able to pay a higher price point these days merchants have the ability to reach the basis of consumers in the world where internet usage is growing and the ability to reach a customer base able to spend more for each product than a u s consumer
2391721 u s consumers going through one merchant are being charged 34 99 for that book u k customers going through the same merchant are being charged 25 99 pounds equivalent to 49 29 to the merchant
2391722 want to expand their base outside the u s can turn u k buyers for example into browsers just by showing them what theyll pay in sterling pounds
2391723 by doing that alone our merchants have seen a 2 to 25 percent increase in their international sales by simply adding foreign currency pricing theyre effectively converting more browsers into buyers because it either looks like its in their country or at least its intended for people in that country
2391724 if the merchant already has international customers on its website and its charging them in u s dollars its effectively giving them a discount those international customers often are willing to pay different price points then on u s currency
2391725 with us everything is u s based and consolidated on the u s site the reconciliation is very simple and there are no foreign banks involved
2391726 the protocol for figuring out multi currency conversion is not easy
2391727 so if you find a shopping cart platform that can do this its a big deal
2391728 we now can work with nearly any currency and pretty much any shipping company
2391729 so the merchants we work with are starting to sell in russia israel norway branching out into other countries now that weve got this ironed out
2391730 the international site can have a different set of graphics templates language settings and currency conversions
2391731 whatever you have in english you press a button and create a whole new set of templates which are then translated by the merchant into the new language the currency is dynamic so thats done automatically
2391732 the best way weve seen is driving traffic by using geo ip
2391733 based on the internet protocol address the system populates the currency based on the shoppers geographical location

2391745 first well need some background concepts the critical ones as i see them are the unconscious and archetypes
2391746 for the production of those contents of the unconscious which lie as it were immediately below the threshold of consciousness and when intensified are the most likely to erupt spontaneously into the conscious mind
2391747 a method of assimilating unconscious contents dreams fantasies etc through some form of self expression the object is to give a voice to sides of the personality particularly the anima animus and the shadow that are normally not heard thereby establishing a line of communication between consciousness and the unconscious

2391764 if something happens with the dolphins it will be because of how i feel about the situation and opportunity it wont have anything to do with the new york jets and me trying to prove something
2391765 the most difficult part of the last 24 hours is coming to the realization that youre no longer wanted by the organization
2391766 you spend eight years there and in the blink of an eye youre no longer wanted there thats the crude part of this business thats hard to accept emotionally
2391767 its clear the organization feels i wasnt the quarterback to lead them where they wanted to go i think thats extremely clear otherwise the decision wouldnt have been made and thats fine thats part of being in this business

2391774 there are certain things that i just didnt feel comfortable with on film and anal sex was one of them its just too intimate to this day i equate doing it with only someone that i 100 percent trust its very private for me
2391775 i would never cheat on the person i am with
2391776 put the currently planned field testing at several sporting and entertainment venues into appropriate context
2391777 regardless of how these tests validate certain technical parameters of spectrum sensing those venues would be fully protected anyway under
2391778 in particular standalone use of a geolocation database with a look up function would offer complete protection to digital tv and wireless microphone signals at major venues
2391779 identified the tv stations in the area and ranked available channels based on environment it was very reliable
2391780 not perfect but it reflected issues the fcc had found in the lab if the fcc decides to use and include sensing in devices that eventually go to market at least it gives them a good feel for what they can do to develop certification tests
2391781 we remain confident that the technical concepts behind spectrum sensing ultimately are sound so that fcc certified white spaces devices can operate safely and efficiently using this particular protection capability

2391789 were pleased with some of the progress weve seen on churn
2391790 we still have a ton of work to do there
2391791 of course we had the few people who did the toss off that its all about revenue
2391792 but the important thing is that about 85 percent of the accidents that happen at these intersections are not roselle residents yet their taxes have to pay for the police officers time to deal with these accidents so why not use technology to prevent this
2391793 we only have so much money and we need to make sure we are using police officers in a way to be most beneficial to our residents
2391794 so if this can have them on the streets patrolling neighborhoods this makes all the sense in the world to us

2391832 i grew up in a small town in wisconsin named pewaukee and actually john is from genesee depot but we went to the same high school kettle moraine you want a spelling on that or are you up on your glacial terms
2391833 and then we also went to the university of wisconsin together for a year and thats probably where we became better friends
2391834 but then koepp transferred to ucla for film school but we kept in touch you know showed different pieces of work to each other and after i graduated college he said why dont you come out to l a and try screenwriting and that sounded a little more fun than law school so i came out and never left
2391835 but after we did those initial jobs we didnt write together for a long time
2391836 but i just really like kamps writing hes got a gift for character and anytime i feel like a script calls for funny you know how people say that funny is really hard funny is actually easy all you have to do is call kamps
2391837 hes just one of the funniest people i know and he manages to have humor that grows out of character which is really really the whole ball game theyre not just jokes theyre jokes because of who the people are
2391838 usually i write and i enjoy the writers lifestyle i like the isolation of writing so when i direct its kind of shocking because there are so many people to deal with and writers are writers because we kind of like the quiet
2391839 and so i was at the very end of this long shoot and everybody was driving me crazy so i went for a walk over lunch on a shooting day and i was walking around in the village and i saw a big tooth shaped sign hanging outside somebodys dental office and i thought what a great profession that must be because the people you work with have cotton shoved in their mouth and they cant talk to you it was a bad day
2391840 so that character just sort of leapt to mind and i thought what would be the worst thing that could happen to that guy if everyone had unfettered access to him and so the ghost premise came in
2391841 and we sat down roughed out an outline and sold it as a treatment to dreamworks
2391842 it was just a dream experience for me because dave kept me involved every step of the way
2391843 i live in california and dave lives in new york and i have two small children so i couldnt be on the set the whole time but i came out for the read through at the beginning of shooting we did a small rewrite at the beginning but when it went into production there werent a lot radical changes they would call occasionally for a line or because something had changed because the location didnt suit the scene but really the script we finished right before they started shooting is what appeared on screen except for editing of course
2391844 and a guy like ricky not only knows how to write well for others and hes won lots of awards for it and done brilliant work but he also knows how to write well for himself
2391845 the character of bertram pincus was very specific on the page he was one of the stronger characters i think john and i have ever written and certainly compared to the ones ive written on my own
2391846 but then whats funny is once ricky was cast it was impossible to imagine anyone else playing him i really think it is a uniquely good meeting of performer and material
2391847 i creci para arriba en una ciudad peque a en
2391848 the government is committed to a more disciplined approach to managing spending
2391849 certainly we felt some of the groups were not necessarily ones we thought canadians would agree were the best choices to be representing them internationally
2391850 i dont even want to say it their name on the phone
2391851 some of the groups we felt had little to do with our foreign policy or how canadians would want us to be perceived abroad
2391852 abolishing this program is the equivalent of killing the entire culture market abroad
2391853 these all seem to indicate concerns that are based in personal taste and conservative ideology rather than in how to best reflect the diversity of culture in canada and how best to represent canadian cultural expression
2391854 it really does seem to play to the most right wing part of the conservative party
2391855 it doesnt strike me as a strong political strategy for a government that is facing re election and byelections
2391856 we are still supporting arts funding including international arts promotion
2391857 thats fertile ground so to speak so were gonna plant its gonna be in the orchards and its gonna bear some wonderful fruit
2391858 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river
2391859 it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength this tree was just growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature around it it was gorgeous
2391860 hes langdon f king awesome but at this point id have to say no on him becoming the new singer
2391861 we just have to make sure its the right guy karmically we deserve the right guy its a tough thing man we make a pretty big noise
2391862 we had to ride out the storms on our tourbus because we were told that iggy pop trashed the dressing room which was then meant to be ours the night before when he discovered his equipment went missing
2391863 weve been robbed once before in belgium and it sucks so i can totally understand how he must have felt
2391864 i had kate winslet right up to the last week in pre production
2391865 i forgave her and understood that completely but i didnt know scarlett from a hole in the wall i thought she was too young she was only 19 years old at the time
2391866 but i was in a hole and had to get someone fairly quickly i knew scarlett was a great actress and a beauty but i didnt know if she was really what i had written i hired her and became totally captivated by her
2391867 i would always call her as i did with diane and mia for years mia was a wonderful actress and she never let me down the same would be true with scarlett
2391868 you are my drug more deadly than afghan heroin more dangerous than colombian white
2391869 its a song about love addiction when people just go crazy you know i know it can be taken in other ways but in the end all the songs can speak for themselves
2391870 dont you see it is the wrong shape dont you see that it has no hearty and plain purpose
2391871 the colours are very beautiful but its the wrong shape
2391872 for anything its the wrong shape in the abstract dont you ever feel that about eastern art the colours are intoxicatingly lovely but the shapes are mean and bad deliberately mean and bad i have seen wicked things in a turkey carpet
2391873 when first he said i want nothing it meant only that he was impenetrable that asia does not give itself away
2391874 he dealt much in eastern heavens rather worse than most western hells
2391875 thats the kind of woman that does her duty for twenty years and then does something dreadful
2391876 best buy looks at my receipt police state the constitution is being burned help
2391877 once the three men were in the water there was very little chance they could get back on the boat as it was blown before a 15 knot wind and they struggled in lumpy seas
2391878 from that point the end would have been swift none of them was a good swimmer the seas were choppy the men would quickly have become exhausted and sunk beneath the waves
2391879 our special thanks go to the water police and the police for their effective operation and their care and compassion towards our families during this very difficult time especially since we were so far away from where it happened
2391880 i have not the slightest doubt that each of the men would contact their wives and families were they alive
2391881 i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates
2391882 and he played it from the bottom of the deck
2391883 you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
2391884 i had an improv class in high school and i came stoned one time i was so paranoid that i never tried to f k with it again
2391885 i marvel at some peoples ability to party and then act im not built that way
2391886 i dont know where this all came from its hilarious its like somebody says something and they run like wildfire with this stuff
2391887 he is at his best shia is doing just fine hes doing great
2391888 until dogs and cats can go on the pill or wear condoms we need to help them practice safe sex by spaying and neutering
2391889 millions of homeless animals are turned in to shelters every year because there simply arent enough good homes for them all the answer is as easy as abc animal birth control which means get fido and fluffy fixed
2391890 i never talk about harry potter because i think that would rob children of something thats private to them
2391891 i think too many things get explained so i hate talking about it
2391892 so pardon me if i dont talk about it until its potter film franchise over it should be left uncommented
2391893 well well probably read about this rescue on the front page of the seattle times tomorrow

2391901 han resaltado en todos los mbitos la necesidad de concretar un proceso que asegure la participaci n de todos los actores involucrados y hemos advertido que de no hacerlo corren el riesgo de recibir impugnaciones legales al ordenamiento que aprueben lo cual redundar en largas demoras paralizando toda la actividad en el territorio provincial
2391902 compartir la preocupaci n por la lentitud con la que se desarrolla la presente etapa
2391903 de nada sirve darle vueltas al asunto esta reuni n se ha derrumbado los miembros no han podido salvar sus diferencias
2391904 consideramos que eso sin duda afecta esas celebraciones pero fundamentalmente afecta a sucre que se merec a una celebraci n y una sesi n de honor del congreso nacional
2391905 lamentablemente sus autoridades de sucre no han contribuido a ello han promovido actos de violencia y han puesto en riesgo la integridad f sica de los congresistas y del cuerpo diplom tico

2391910 abbie and eddie are great ambassadors for prince edward island and the 2009 canada games and we are thrilled to introduce them to children of all ages today
2391911 i must commend our volunteer mascot committee who helped plan for their creation as these characters will be able to tell a unique story about the games and appeal to children across our island and our country
2391912 he was immensely talented when he came into the weavers to replace pete seeger he brought so much of his own talents to bear that it was overwhelming
2391913 there doesnt seem to be any heartbeat you can try to wait and check again in a few days time but i dont think it makes a difference
2391914 we regret to announce that due to illness the worcester show originally scheduled for friday at the dcu center has been rescheduled for november 9th
2391915 the band is sincerely sorry for the last minute announcement but unfortunately trents recurring throat ailment has left him unable to perform
2391916 i just want to personally say how sorry i am to have to do this i never take postponing a show lightly and if there were any possible way i could pull this off i would
2391917 this is a very frustrating and maddening situation for me and i appreciate your understanding ill make it up to you
2391918 i gave a 3 hour heart felt interview and what became of it was quotes that were usually about something else entirely in the conversation grossly simplified and taken way out of context and sprinkled randomly and erroneously throughout the 2 pages sic
2391919 if you want it magazine for the photos then great but i am not behind the article at all
2391920 they really could have ran with it baby news but they said they would not they actually kept their word which i found so refreshing i couldnt believe it
2391921 i really want to thank them for that they are one of the last remaining entertainment news shows that has kept its dignity and high standards in the current morally degraded climate we are now in
2391922 a thinking mans zombie novel paffenroth has looked beyond the initial bloodshed to what happens after the end of the world he explores deep philosophical issues while never letting the horror fan go hungry for gore

2391924 type jokes lets hear your best you can come up with amp ill take a vote later for the winner it doesnt have to be a man amp a bar just a something walking into a something else dont be shy now just give it your best shot 1 a mushroom walked into a bar amp ordered a drink we dont serve your kind
2391925 i feel great a few aches and pains that im taking care of the training is going really well im the fittest ive ever been
2391926 i didnt have the same kind of pressure for qualifying i felt that i was more established as an athlete and more of a consistent performer this time around so going into the games have a little bit different feel i think im at the peak of my abilities
2391927 theres really only one answer to that is there not
2391928 two time olympian gary reed the canadian 800 metre champion and i were talking last night and its one of those events like no other you go into the event knowing exactly whos going to be there theres no questioning whether or not its going to be a fast meet its the olympics you know
2391929 often i think sometimes at a lower calibre meet you start getting into thinking strategic sort of tactical things throughout the rounds but olympics its just live in the moment and really sort of warmup call room track race and in that order and if you keep it like that you dont overthink and i think overthinking really causes nervousness
2391930 there are more athletes capable of medalling this time around last time there might have been a couple of favourites i probably could have named you the people who won the actual medals before the event but this time theres probably at least half of the field thats capable of medalling
2391931 its sort of a grand scheme of warmups waking up eating going to the track going through security settling down warming up going to the call room going to the track getting in the blocks racing you dont get too far ahead
2391932 youre not in the blocks thinking oh oh if i run poorly the media is going to be mad at me
2391933 if you kind of ball all those 20 different steps up into this one looming craziness it can get overwhelming so i really try not to focus too much on any of them you know quick on my feet during interviews and things like that im prepared for it but i really dont know yet well have to wait and see
2391934 the location has not been decided tourism minister valerie docherty said at a press conference in charlottetown friday to make the announcement
2391935 we have four provincial golf courses and were working on trying to decide what will actually be the spot it might not be mill river
2391936 they might do some filming at another course but none of that has been worked out or finalized at this point and time
2391937 we dont have a presence in the golf market in the united states she said emphatically

2391942 one of the biggest challenges that heritage has had to face in recent years is there has not been enough resources financial and human
2391943 thats been really important theres been a lot of people who care
2391944 the province has a good collection it just needs a better facility to house them
2391945 there needs to be a central facility that will house the provincial museum and archives
2391946 it gives us a chance to see if theres something we missed
2391947 we have come up with an area of origin and we believe we know the cause so in a case like this when we believe the fire was set the investigation is turned over to the police
2391948 total loss with a replacement cost estimated at around 100 000
2391949 its 106 miles to chicago we have 1 2 a tank of gas half a pack of cigarettes its dark and were wearing sunglasses hit it
2391950 apparently china must improve its human rights record but it should do so on its own terms
2391951 we know we are more than just neurons firing or at least we think we are while the neurons are firing
2391952 this is what will happen you want to go to school you will not get no loans because all college loans are federal and government loans so youll be black marked from that as soon as you get pulled over for a speeding ticket or anything with the law theyre gonna see that youre a deserter then theyre going to apprehend you take you to jail you will do your time as you deserve all that lovey dovey i want to go to college and all this guess what you just threw it out the window because you just screwed your life
2391953 in this case we assumed the worst and it came out better than we anticipated
2391954 the total extent of the damage was a two foot wide by about a five foot wide area of one of the girders
2391955 were looking into it and we might get highway safety involved but well see

2391964 a dutch primary school teacher has accidentally discovered what some are calling a cosmic space ghost a strange greenish gaseous object with a hole in the middle that may represent a new type of astronomical phenomena
2391965 he says astronomers think it may be light from a quasar the bright stormy center of a distant galaxy powered by a supermassive black hole
2391966 we know we are more than just neurons firing or at least we think we are while the neurons are firing
2391967 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen

2391977 your one stop shopping for climate change news and views and overall round up of politics and the environment this site serves as my primary climate change information portal
2391978 ove new blog climate shifts is a welcome addition to the online coverage of climate change and coral reefs ove is one of the worlds top experts on the subject his 1999 paper on climate change and coral bleaching helped bring the problem to the attention of the public and other scientists myself included
2391979 sea surface temperatures are significantly warming along the northwest and northeast coasts of australia regions containing well protected and internationally significant tropical marine ecosystems
2391980 average climate zones have also shifted more than 200km south along the northeast coast and about half that distance along the northwest coast
2391981 this paper was to show that this is happening now and has already happened
2391982 this is down to global warming due to human activities
2391983 a rise of 0 1c every 10 years might not seem like a lot but in scientific terms it is significant
2391984 over 50 or 100 years you are completely changing the climate region
2391985 more acidic ocean could spell trouble for marine lifes earliest stages

2391988 the 12 hottest years in history have all been in the last 13 years
2391989 its not a question of debate what about the medieval warming period the historical record shows they were growing wine in england for goodness sake come on it is not disputed by anyone that the vikings arrived in greenland in ad900 and it was warmer than greenland is now what penny wong is doing is being selective and saying that is a long time ago
2391990 land based temperature readings are corrupted by the urban heat island effect
2391991 urban areas encroaching on thermometer stations warm the micro climate around the thermometer due to vegetation changes concrete cars and houses
2391992 that doesnt mean you give up on the science and that you cant draw valid conclusions about the nature of earths temperature change
2391993 create a brouhaha and muddy the waters in the climate change story
2391994 all official measures of global temperature show that it peaked in 1998 and has been declining since at least 2002
2391995 and this is in the face of an almost 5 per cent increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide since 1998 spot the problem
2391996 the changes in temperature over the past 10 years have basically plateaued
2391997 but scientists did not anticipate a gradual year by year warming in temperature what matters is the long term trend this outcome does not change any of the science but it does change the spin climate deniers can put on it
2391998 in the last 10 years we have seen an increase in carbon dioxide levels yet temperatures are coming down that if anyone looks at the actual data is not disputable carbon dioxide is not driving temperatures because there are other important climatic factors at play
2391999 from a climate standpoint it is far too short a period to have any significance
2392000 what we are seeing now is consistent with our understanding of variability between decades if we hung about for another 30 years and it kept going down then you might start to think there is something we dont understand but the evidence at this point suggests this is not something we should hang around and wait for
2392001 in the last 10 years there has been a catastrophic and massive arctic sea ice retreat weve seen glacial retreat permafrost thaw and ocean thermal expansion so temperature is not the whole story
2392002 it is widely alleged that the science of global warming is settled
2392003 this implies that all the major scientific aspects of climate change are well understood and uncontroversial the allegation is profoundly untrue even the most widely held opinions should never be regarded as an ultimate truth
2392004 here take back the stuff that i am nature knead it back into the dough of being make of me a bush a cloud whatever you will even a man only no longer make me me

2392007 is there something i can visualize that would help me feel a little more relaxed
2392008 there is a natural tendency for most people to do some mental imaging some will see only pictures others will see pictures hear sounds feel movements of the body some people will actually move through the skills
2392009 make that picture of yourself running and see what you would like to change
2392010 then float back into the body and make the correction and then float out of your body and see if you made the correction
2392011 then go out to compete and play and forget about it the fastest way to mess something up is to think about it in detail while you are doing it
2392012 i would like to offer my greetings to the peoples republic of china the organizers and the athletes participating in the forthcoming olympic games in beijing
2392013 get your motor running head out on the highway looking for adventure and whatever comes my way
2392014 the point is to become yourself to use yourself completely all your skills gifts and energies in order to make your vision manifest
2392015 this is a safe place no imminent threats its just yoga
2392016 we are all neurotic how great it is if we can bow to that part of ourselves
2392017 stress i see you again and i am going to try this other thing that feels better
2392018 my ideas usually come not at my desk writing but in the midst of living
2392019 in 1996 terry hitchcock ran from minneapolis to atlanta in 75 consecutive days covering the equivalent of a marathon or more each day because he wanted to make towns and cities and even the whole country aware that 35 million people are part of a single parent family

2392021 junior guard patrick beverley will not compete for the razorbacks in the 2008 09 basketball season
2392022 if this guy will work for free ive simply got to convince him work at my organization is fun and greatly benefits society and then maybe i can low ball him into working 60 hours a week for 40k a year
2392023 requires 1 or more years of experience in this field
2392024 we have russian tanks moving in we have continuous russian bombardment since yesterday specifically targeting the civilian population russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2392025 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2392026 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2392027 we urge an immediate ceasefire in fighting in south ossetia and a resumption of direct dialogue between the parties
2392028 the so called frozen conflict is now really hotting up
2392029 the georgian president has tried to push the matter into a military solution of eliminating the biggest stumbling block to nato membership
2392030 world attention is focused elsewhere with world leaders either in beijing watching the opening ceremony of the games or on holiday
2392031 the georgina gamble was to overrun south ossetia quickly so they could establish forces on the ground
2392032 georgia fired the first shot but will claim that they were driven to it by the skirmishes that have been taking place on a daily basis over the past few weeks
2392033 and russian aircraft and armoured vehicles have violated georgian airspace for months what happens next will depend on whether a ceasefire can be agreed between the two sides over the next 24 hours

2392099 how a little known tax loophole can let you double your retirement income
2392100 may suggest that soa isnt viewed as strategically within it as many have been led to believe
2392101 suggests that achieving soas goal of improving its alignment with the business may be difficult as the individual most responsible for this activity the cio is not actively involved with their enterprises soa initiatives
2392102 most users view soa governance as important and acknowledge their need for improvement meeting business objectives is seen as a key driver for adoption they are also emphasizing the need for a holistic lifecycle approach to soa governance from the start
2392103 finally only a small percentage of users are able so far to effectively chargeback for soa related development costs
2392104 business units dont necessarily want to own business services they certainly dont want to work for another business unit so who pays for changes does a business unit own a service what benefit would it be for them to share it
2392105 it is almost always easier to crank out new lines of code than to
2392106 the only group that responds positively to the word is the finance function they are excited about it because of the cost model the concept of turning a recurring cost it into a reusable asset is very appealing to them and they dont have the cynical experiences of the past they just think hmm this is obvious lets do it
2392107 a lot of people are saying im tired because i pitched in winter ball but i only pitched eight innings in winter ball so how can i get tired with eight innings
2392108 i pitched more innings in spring training than winter ball
2392109 probably the most difficult part of this sport is coming to the park every day knowing you are in last place and have to work your way up every day thats the challenge we have what we have to overcome
2392110 i spent the first third of the season just taking it all in what a big league season is all about
2392111 im at the tail end of the second third of the season and im trying to establish myself as a player
2392112 now i feel like i have to stay upbeat and concentrate my efforts on helping the team not that i wasnt before but whatever i can do to help the team win in any way shape or form being a younger player im trying to learn that
2392113 this is his first year and he is 7 11
2392114 i started my career 1 11 0 6 my first year and started 1 5 my second year
2392115 i had a lot of old guys next to me like vicente padilla and francisco cordero in texas
2392116 they kept telling me you know you can pitch in the big leagues just keep working thats what i kept in my mind even when i was 1 11 keep confident i knew i could sometime have a year like this year
2392117 it is of the utmost importance that we have a place thats ours
2392118 its important to have a place thats dedicated only to soccer a place where we can schedule everything
2392119 we had to rent fields and that was very expensive
2392120 it took a long time to find the right place the right location

2392122 competing in the olympic games has always been one of my dreams and i wish i would have been able to represent my country alongside my teammates
2392123 his is why i dont go anymore its not cool at all and its just a bunch of stuffy masturbating monkeys aka one big money pit self loving joke

2392125 ive learned a lot become a better professional and a better man because of my experience and my time in new york i dont regret or feel ashamed about anything that happened to me in my time in new york
2392126 the most difficult part is just the realization that the organization no longer wants you
2392127 you spend eight years there and in the blink of an eye youre no longer wanted there
2392128 russia has already begun consultations with the ambassadors of the nato countries and consultations with nato military representatives will be held tomorrow
2392129 we will caution them against continuing to further support of saakashvili
2392130 it is an undisguised aggression accompanied by a mass propaganda war
2392131 it all confirms our numerous warnings addressed to the international community that it is necessary to pay attention to massive arms purchasing by georgia during several years now we see how these arms and georgian special troops who had been trained by foreign specialists are used
2392132 it concerns not only georgia it concerns the u s and its values we are a freedom loving country which is being attacked
2392133 we ask our friends including the u s to be mediators and try persuading russia to stop this military aggression and incursion into georgia
2392134 it is the third genocide of the ossetian people from the side of georgia and saakashvili is the main murderer
2392135 irrespective of the development of situation in south ossetia we wont stop moving to the border with georgia today they launch a military aggression against south ossetia and tomorrow it could be abkhazia it cannot go on like that
2392136 we are extremely concerned with the latest developments and we think that it is very regrettable that there has been loss of lives the most urgent thing at the moment is to calm the situation down
2392137 were urging moscow to press south ossetias de facto leaders to stop firing
2392138 despite our call for peace and a unilateral ceasefire separatists continued the shelling of georgian villages
2392139 we are forced to restore constitutional order in the whole region
2392140 the fighting is more serious than weve seen for some time
2392141 how serious its going to get is unclear while there are hundreds of breaches of the ceasefire every year whats happened over the past few days is of a completely different order
2392142 the military assistance rendered to the separatists criminal regime by the russian federation in violation of all agreements cannot be assessed in any other way than as another act of aggression against georgia
2392143 jesse benton a spokesman for ron paul said that his boss does not plan to recommend supporters to champion barr
2392144 bob and ron are former colleagues and theyre friends but thats where the relationship ends
2392145 an orchestrated dance of carefully worded statements heaps of innuendo and a staggering lack of real evidence all contorted to create the illusion of guilt by dr ivins
2392146 the situation is so catastrophic that the international committee of the red cross has asked for a humanitarian corridor
2392147 we can go into a company if they need help with a security awareness program
2392148 there are an amazing amount of things that we could see by watching the traffic go by
2392149 we were saying there are so many of them they are everywhere
2392150 according to the south ossetian information and press committee the number of fatalities is estimated according to preliminary information at over 1 000
2392151 weve missed a little bit on qualifying hopefully it looks like the car is pretty strong this week
2392152 the way to love anything is to realize that it might be lost
2392153 said watern a centerville resident who works at wright patterson air force base
2392154 its a myth that people over 40 are washed up i feel better in my 40s than i did in my 30s
2392155 she weight trains has a chiropractor does yoga has a dietician and has the natural talent so its not too surprising
2392156 its a genetic component that lets her be able to maintain the physique that 99 9 percent of people dont have
2392157 as you age you lose muscle mass but if they have maintained their training they can slow that loss
2392158 in college i couldnt tell you where the rec center was now its a big thing for colleges to build bigger and better rec centers its whats important now
2392159 i think well see more older elite athletes but i wouldnt expect to see a 40 year old gymnast anytime soon
2392160 many swimmers improve after high school and college because of a more mature body better discipline and increased desire
2392161 what dara has done doesnt come as a surprise to me
2392162 the understanding of the physiology of the swimming stroke and the body in the water has increased and improved training methods have followed
2392163 thats why you see the times drop swimmers are using their whole body now their torsos not just arms and legs
2392164 before my injury a year and a half ago i could sprint with most young guys
2392165 i have a friend whos 55 and still out sprinting the young riders
2392166 i was swimming my 50 meter breaststroke in 35 seconds for years
2392167 now its at 40 seconds no matter what i do you just naturally lose bone and muscle mass
2392168 at a race in santa rosa california i got into a breakaway and wasnt hydrating
2392169 within the last few miles dehydration hit me the pack caught up and i ended up finishing 36th
2392170 the sense of thirst doesnt really hit you when you get older when i finally realized i wasnt hydrating it was too late
2392171 when you finish after all your hard work theres a feeling of satisfaction i love just knowing ive done well

2392173 a phalanx of young men with cropped hair who followed me wherever i went

2392178 the tragedy in darfur could not continue without the ongoing support of
2392179 shame on the olympic committee for choosing beijing and putting athletes in this untenable position
2392180 in the last year china has really done an about face on darfur at least in word if not yet in deed
2392181 china sent engineers to the region china criticised sudan publicly
2392182 now that a threshold has been set for advocacy that makes china move we think the momentum is just going to build
2392183 akin to getting invited to a party where all the cool kids are going then showing up and finding out theres no food no drinks no band no games no pool nothing just a bunch of painful small talk and leering grins the people watching can hold your interest for only so long
2392184 i understand how you feel but i know they dont maybe sometimes its good to accept that we have some weaknesses no matter how strong we are
2392185 nuestra idea se apoya en un album digital desarrollado para celulares con un video juego como parte total del mismo que vincula el jugar con la serie de laminas virtuales en este sentido el video juego puede ser mario bros de deporte o de cualquier genero que se pueda portar al celular manteniendose la posibilidad de cambiar el juego para hacer nuevos albumes asi existira una interfaz web opciones de compra de sobres virtuales intercambio de laminas con otros usuarios de la plataforma y la aplicacion del movil contara con informacion que no requiere conexion a internet para ser accedida en otro lado del video juego
2392186 estabamos decididos en desarrollar para celular y teniamos algunas ideas de aplicaciones que aprovecharan la conexion a internet de esta forma nuestro cliente mobilemate nos ofrecio diversas alternativas entre las cuales se encontraba un album para celular con el grupo tomamos la idea y la desarrollamos para hacerla mas atractiva agregandole un video juego y enfocandolo a celulares de gama media
2392187 al enfocarse en celulares de gama media se espera tener la capacidad de aprovechar la tecnologia que recientemente parece darse por obsoleta pero sigue siendo fuertemente usada en el pais dandole a los usuarios una nueva forma de aprovechar su movil
2392188 esperamos crear una aplicacion entretenida e interactiva que sin grandes recursos en el celular permita al usuario jugar coleccionar e interactuare con otras personas pero mas que una aplicacion de celular nosotros apuntamos a un sistema compuesto de la aplicacion en el celular y una plataforma web que permitira interactividad mas avanzada entre los usuarios

2392215 the market is simple reflecting the fundamentals of supply and demand markets participants are considering the world slowdown the deterioration in expectations for the growth worldwide
2392216 when investors realised how much demand was increasing they bid up prices and when they realised how much inflation was increasing they bid up prices further
2392217 now growth rates are declining throughout the world the market overreacts to that too

2392228 in the u s box office driven industry if you want to do a smaller personal film you have to find your own financing
2392229 with 250 passenger cars on the road this equates to 125 billion fewer miles driven
2392230 at an average 20 miles per gallon this will result in a reduction in gasoline consumption of 6 billion gallons equivalent to 307 million barrels of crude oil
2392231 our conclusion is that as for the first time in more than 20 years annual mileage driven on american roads is declining and the rate of that decline is accelerating the many factors causing this decline make for a very complex pattern

2392242 when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 percent honest is no longer enough
2392243 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help i have given a complete interview on this matter and having done so will have nothing more to say

2392277 todays gospel has taken an amazing twist there is little or no more preaching about sin and its consequences but rather what somebody can do to be rich healthy or retain a blessing in uganda some churches discourage tithing coins and in such churches is where you will find believers standing in queues according to how much they are tithing which determines the amount of blessing they will get

2392309 there remains still another condition that arose during the process of going to bed on a crowded canal boat when the floor and tables were all occupied as well as the shelves it became necessary to erect a zigzag series of clotheslines back and forth across the cabin on which the discarded garments of the passengers might be hung the scenic effect produced in the sleeping room when this process had been completed somewhat resembled that displayed by the back yard of a modern tenement house on washday finally after all the travelers were spread out upon their berths and on the tables and floor and the light had been put out the unhappy assemblage subsided into a restless but unseen throng in which the stillness was only broken by faint moaning the creaking of the boat and an occasional stentorian snore after suffering for several hours amid the conditions here outlined it was a common occurrence that some passenger abandoned his endeavor to obtain rest in an upper berth and decided to quit it for the better air and greater comfort to be found on the roof he therefore cautiously lowered his feet in the direction of some table whose position as it stood when he went to bed was remembered by him he would try to perform this operation of getting a foothold with utmost quietude in order that he might not disturb his fellow travelers hanging from his shelf by his elbows and feeling in the darkness with his foot for the table he was seeking he might at last find it only to step on the prostrate form of some belated passenger to whom it had been allotted then the mischance occurred and being anxious to comply with the sudden protest which it evoked he would hastily try to shift the position of his feet only to discover that he was astraddle of one of the clotheslines he then abandoned further hope of a peaceful solution of his difficulties and let go without caring where he alighted or how

2392387 i didnt even tell my mum until after the fight
2392388 the people i told all kind of reacted like you fighting chop chop he went twelve with floyd mayweather and rocked him and he shock up miguel cotto but i believe in me and i know who i can beat a lot of them top boys i spar with wbc number four ajose olusegun all the time so i know how to fight southpaws so i was very confident
2392389 i basically saw that demarcus corley was fighting in 10 days on the internet so i got my adviser stacy warren from hoodstripes entertainment to contact them i was weighing 151lbs but got my weight down just in time
2392390 boxing trainer john tandy who i was working with in camp knew i wanted the fight when he saw me using my right hand on pads on our last day working together
2392391 i was training for three weeks in newark new jersey and couldnt use my right hand as it was hurting too much
2392392 if corley wasnt a southpaw it wouldnt have bothered me but i knew i could hit him all day long with my right hand southpaws dont bother me
2392393 thats a call out right there to them top southpaws hoodstars coming for you baby
2392394 i 100 believed in myself i was at his last fight in madison square garden against wbc number one devon alexander and i knew i had what he takes to beat both of them i did a better job than alexander if i had 12 rounds chop chop would have been chopped down and stopped this is why i got involved in boxing to fight the big names
2392395 chop chop had don turner as his coach and they where saying they going to whoop my ass they where asking the waitress at the hotel what i was eating i didnt care what they where eating cause i knew i eat real good
2392396 he didnt say much his whole team thought i was his way back into the big time but i knew he was my ticket he was stronger than i thought he would be
2392397 people look at my record and think i dont want to fight no one or think i have been carried but they dont know that i have been self managed for four years three years officially so i have never had a promoter or manager really i have financed myself to where i am now
2392398 i aint supposed to be here in this position many people would have given up i could be dead or in jail or even on the block but i chose this path and this is what i am focusing on
2392399 i think it did help the first fight i did in germany i was more nervous than this i enjoyed the whole build up to this fight people thinking chop chop was going to knock me out i even enjoyed chop chops ring entrance the crowd was chanting his name and the first three rounds chanting usa usa but i made them go quiet as round by round i broke him down i was smiling to myself
2392400 i think my defence which is normally my strength wasnt too much there but i wasnt fighting the typical hoodstar way
2392401 i thanked him and told him i had watched all his big fights and it was an honour to share a ring with him i want the big fights he has had and i am very sure they will come
2392402 its funny im born and bred in london but the only promoters who have shown an interest in signing me are jonathan feld wso and frank maloney so i have to say they know talent but the others i wont mention names dont want a lawsuit jh neither does bbn thanks
2392403 they sign people like barry morrison colin lynes gavin rees david barnes and lenny daws but they wouldnt sign me how funny is that
2392404 there are some offers on the table still early stages but some us promoters are interested in working with me
2392405 ali oubaali what can i say the us boxing press liked me but people in the us who seen me sparring these world ranked fighters knew that wasnt me that turned up i fought the wrong fight the first few rounds and played catch up some journalists still gave me the fight
2392406 it happens the best in the world have lost roy jones jr marvin hagler pernell whitaker but its how they come back so it happens but i came back and came back big
2392407 i was supposed to go camp with dmitriy salita but corley burst my ear drum so just ticking over doing some yoga and pilates i am in the us for another month maybe tying up a promotional deal there maybe some big news real soon
2392408 the reason i came to the us is because i was supposed to sign a management deal with a company but we saw my future differently thats why i left camp and fought corley its funny how things work out
2392409 bridge academy amp fox primary school are two schools i work regularly with but its also nice sometimes to work with the youth when i can especially youth that come from my background
2392410 last year i spent four months abroad this year out of the eight months i have been abroad for four months and i could be coming back again this year it makes me appreciate the people in my life more and i love travelling life is too short to be bored i try to make the most out of life happiness is important to me and i love my job i have met so many cool people and been all over the world through boxing
2392411 i have never been a fan of amateur boxing but always followed the americans and cubans i like stylish boxing
2392412 ill be watching the olympics and one thing i want to say to the british fighters you dont need luck just go do what you do bang bang
2392413 thanks bbn for making me fighter of the week i have waited a long time for that

2392418 i dont want to say anything bad about them ingles as i had great times with them but i needed to move on im only 26 and im ready to shine i can fight and i can box ive got the talent the ability and the charisma ive got the full package and i want my name in bright lights
2392419 i spoke to tommy and it felt right he has plenty of experience and taken numerous fighters to world championship level if he cant take me to the top no one can i should have been top man in scotland a long time ago
2392420 if i was able to beat the grim reaper i dont think anyone has got much chance against me in the ring i want to be kept busy and any fighter will tell you you improve by fighting regularly
2392421 any one who can put 2 000 bums on seats on a non televised show deserves to be in a bigger movie

2392423 i gave a 3 hour heart felt interview and what became of it was quotes that were usually about something else entirely in the conversation grossly simplified and taken way out of context and sprinkled randomly and erroneously throughout the 2 pages sic
2392424 if you want it magazine for the photos then great but i am not behind the article at all
2392425 they really could have ran with it baby news but they said they would not they actually kept their word which i found so refreshing i couldnt believe it
2392426 i really want to thank them for that they are one of the last remaining entertainment news shows that has kept its dignity and high standards in the current morally degraded climate we are now in
2392427 its a very big blow the amount of money that has been spent on amateur boxing someone has a lot of answering to do these have been training like professionals and i think thats wrong your body will change and the weight difference will happen but it seems no one has taken this into account
2392428 someones heads got to roll because of the amount of money that has been put into this fighter there have been rumours going round for weeks that this fighter was not going to make the weight the overall responsibility has to go down to the head coach who is the overall chief the man at the top has to pay the price i know him personally so its very hard for me but the man at the top should go they have a lot of questions to answer
2392429 theres that many people who are involved these days and its just been a total let down
2392430 i guarantee that i would have got frankie gavin to make the weight
2392431 im the guy who starts working with ricky hatton when he rolls into the gym weighing 185 pounds and i get him to shift 45 pounds in time to make the weight every time before every fight
2392432 its simply criminal that hes not going to the olympics i can only guess that some real errors have been made and that frankie has been let down
2392433 making the weight is not an issue you just make the weight
2392434 im ahead of where i want to be with my weight and i cant see how my preparation could have gone any better
2392435 we will review the sport post games as a matter of course and not about just one individual
2392436 clearly this will be an issue for the boxing review we do think he has trained incredibly hard and always had the right support but ultimately only he has responsibility for the weight that he is
2392437 he gavin obviously has to take a lot of responsibility if he knew he wasnt going to make the weight he should have said so ages ago and not gone there and wasted the taxpayers money his value has been cut considerably a lot of people will be asking can he be trusted has he got self discipline it an individual sport and the responsibility lies with you one has to ask about his commitment to the sport this kid had a golden opportunity to write his own cheque out and hes just blown it over weight
2392438 abae will launch an internal investigation into the circumstances leading up to gavins withdrawal which is a massive blow to our gold medal hopes and to our essential uk sport and lottery funding
2392439 but youre convinced that to put it crudely when you die thats it
2392440 hes langdon f king awesome but at this point id have to say no on him becoming the new singer

2392445 most of my work is photographed at night night photography is slow and calm but at the same time the very precise process that suits my way of working i like the way i can focus at night since there is less distraction both visually and acoustically than during the day the artificial light and color atmosphere that can be found at night appeals to me and matches my understanding of beauty
2392446 my photography is about what people dont see even when its right in front of them making the mundane sublime having empathy with others and the environment i am fascinated by the pursuit of happiness and how people live their lives i believe happiness in life is about balance moderation and living in harmony with the environment
2392447 close to photojournalism with a strong graphic design background i started using photography to capture and remember what i found interesting though my eyes people places details i use photography to share my view of the world to express myself
2392448 since 2005 i have photographed the sex workers and their families in pakistan being the first photographer to document this shunned community this body of work examines the uneasy peace between islamic fundamentalism and profanity in the brothels repressive fundamentalist muslim laws not only shun these womens existence but in some areas make their actions punishable by death however in their brothels the women are the breadwinners this underlying dualism surfaces in portraits of the women sitting proudly on the same beds where they not only service their customers but share with their husbands and children
2392449 i began this project looking at fake nature wondering what substitutions for nature can satisfy in people looking deeper i began photographing live animals and how they can be a link for us to a world far from the reality and pace of contemporary life as well as provide an intangible link to a deeper world of instinct and rawness with this series i hope to incite contemplation about the lives of animals and generate a dialog about resource usage

2392453 so pardon me if i dont talk about it until its potter film franchise over it should be left uncommented

2392508 we regret to announce that due to illness the worcester show originally scheduled for friday at the dcu center has been rescheduled for november 9th
2392509 the band is sincerely sorry for the last minute announcement but unfortunately trents recurring throat ailment has left him unable to perform
2392510 i just want to personally say how sorry i am to have to do this i never take postponing a show lightly and if there were any possible way i could pull this off i would
2392511 this is a very frustrating and maddening situation for me and i appreciate your understanding ill make it up to you
2392512 this scene went on for a long time like half the day and its getting old and i go over to sean and i guess he didnt know that i was wearing a prosthetic
2392513 i go sean youre such a great actor but you wouldnt do a scene like this if they asked you you wouldnt dive into a pool naked
2392514 and he said well james if i was built like you i would
2392515 a couple of weeks later we did this scene where were both dancing and were naked and we both have prosthetic penises he finally put it together that im wearing like the boogie nights prosthetic
2392516 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2392517 although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 percent honest is no longer enough
2392518 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly but that misconduct took place for a short period in 2006 it ended then
2392519 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2392520 i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2392521 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2392522 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2392523 i have given a complete interview on this matter and having done so will have nothing more to say

2392564 im deeply disappointed that congressman broun chose to put party above principle with his vote last night im not a doctor like my opponent is but i do know the hippocratic oath and its charge to protect patients from harm
2392565 with his vote against childrens health care congressman broun has broken that promise and if he had his way hundreds of thousands of georgia children and their families would be harmed
2392566 im going to fight to keep our promise to our children because this is about more than just a health care bill healthy children do better in school they learn more and they succeed thats good not just for the children and their families but for the future of americas workforce and economy when i am elected to congress i will always put the interests of our families and children first

2392572 we disagree in the strongest possible terms with the courts decision and maintain that georgias voter id law continues to represent a burden to the public and to the right to vote the law especially places an additional burden on elderly and low income voters
2392573 over the next few months we will be ramping up our voter education programs to ensure that every voter is prepared to vote with one of the proper forms of identification to that end well be working closely with our county parties to help them educate voters at the grassroots level well also be focusing closely on our election protection program to prevent inaccuracies and inequalities at the voting booths
2392574 let that fill in the blank from augusta tell us what to do here in athens
2392575 broun taking a cc 5 122 601 is just staggering
2392576 imagine if speaker richardson was in control of this community
2392577 how much money do you think athens would get from state coffers
2392578 we are going to have to beg for money in atlanta
2392579 we would lose all local autonomy its the end of home rule in georgia its the end of local control unless you happen to be a community thats very closely aligned with whatever power structure is in atlanta at the time
2392580 i just cant imagine having state taxes funding the local school system
2392581 when you look at it realistically youre taking local control away from the school system
2392582 it was very clear that no one seemed to like this plan and i would say i was in the minority as far as party affiliation
2392583 ive got several questions to be answered local control questions
2392584 if you are going to overhaul the tax system i would like to see the regressive nature of the taxes that are being suggested eliminated

2392588 for more than 130 years democrats like dubose porter and his pessimistic friends presided over an educational system
2392589 representative porters comments yesterday were disrespectful and insulting to georgia teachers administrators parents and most of all our high school students who have worked hard to improve their sat scores over the last four years
2392590 his comment im not surprised this is exactly the result i was expecting is indicative of his bigotry of low expectations
2392591 his reference to a massive public relations campaign minimizes the hours weeks and months of hard work and effort that georgia teachers students and parents have put forth to result in closing the gap with the national average
2392592 today four and a half years after i was elected georgia is steadily closing the gap on the sat national average since 2003 the gap between georgia and the national average has shrunk by one third from a 42 point gap to only 28 points
2392593 georgias minority students are even outpacing their counterparts around the nation with higher scores in most areas of the test
2392594 in terms of participation rates georgia public schools beat the national average by 20 percentage points approximately 66 percent of public school students in georgia take the sat while an average of only 42 percent of public school students nationwide take the sat
2392595 georgia teachers continue to be the highest paid in the southeast
2392596 thanks to our high school and middle school graduation coaches our graduation rates have increased by almost eight points
2392597 as i said yesterday despite all our gains i will not be satisfied with georgias sat scores or ranking until these indicators become a true reflection of the quality of education that is being provided to students in our state every day
2392598 u s rep paul broun offered democrats a peace pipe and sent republican leaders hopes that hed toe the party line up in smoke this week by voting to ease federal restrictions on medical marijuana laws
2392599 the republican congressman from athens was sworn in wednesday and cast his first vote in the house of representatives late that night in support of an amendment to stop the u s justice department from prosecuting people who distribute medical marijuana in states where it is legal
2392600 the measure failed 262 165 but broun said he fulfilled his campaign promises to respect states rights and be independent by bucking gop leadership and joining just 14 other republicans who voted for the amendment proposed by reps maurice hinchey d n y and dana rohrabacher r calif
2392601 rep john barrow d savannah a former athens clarke commissioner voted against the amendment as did georgias six other house republicans besides broun
2392602 we are celebrating our 41st anniversary today on aug 4 we were married at ages 19 and 20 the keys to our and all in my opinion marriage first is our faith in jesus christ we were not believers until many years into our marriage but god had a plan for us that we didnt even know about

2392618 for fuel prices to rival repaying a home loan as a major financial consideration shows just how much the cost of petrol has factored into australian household budgets
2392619 thankfully prices have come down with the global price of oil dropping in recent weeks but the steep cost of petrol is now firmly in the australian financial psyche
2392620 the australian economy has certainly slowed down and the pressure will be on the rba and the banks to reduce rates in the next few months

2392690 you might say i am already an expert when it comes to trying out different slimming products in the market from diet pills to imported slimming teas none of them worked and all had side effects that induced drowsiness lbm vomiting and irregular heartbeat
2392691 when i included hydrotrim as part of my diet regime i began to feel more energetic i also noticed that i began to lose weight gradually
2392692 my craving for rice during meals diminished and i was encouraged to exercise a bit more frequently as i noticed my waistline becoming smaller and smaller plus i never experienced any of the side effects that i experienced in other products
2392693 when i was invited by hydrotrim to be part of the free slimming trial program i was hesitant at first i was afraid of experiencing side effects and i didnt want to risk my health
2392694 but when they explained to me that hydrotrim helps burn fat naturally because of its citric acid content i was convinced plus the orange flavoring of hydrotrim makes me feel like im drinking my regular orange drink during my meals

2392700 he treated me like a son i worked with him day in and day out for 13 years and never once did he call himself the owner he was more like a co worker and a friend
2392701 a lot of people never saw his sense of humor but i did we used to laugh daily

2392717 we expect big things to happen here at congo grille trinoma mainly because we have more to offer to mall shoppers we even have a happy hour promo that gives free pulutan of choice for office workers who want to unwind
2392718 we are continuing the noble mission that we started last year with gawad kalinga we are also hopeful that this effort which brings about a positive perspective in life through decent and livable housing for our less fortunate brothers will soon gain nationwide support and recognition from fellow institutions
2392719 our company has been adamant in instilling to our employees the importance of voluntary work through self less acts of community service we believe that people to be fully aware and sensitive towards the needs of others have to show their compassion by actively fulfilling their moral obligation to those who have few in life
2392720 we at gk village pinagsama are very happy and thankful that a big company like 7 eleven and its people are committed to this cause knowing that there are still individuals and establishments that care for our well being is a very inspirational thought for us we hope that this kind of partnership becomes permanent so that goodwill to those of us in need will be fostered for a long time
2392721 philippine seven corp and the 7 eleven chain of convenience stores will be their first customers they can even use us as their reference when selling their products to other customers
2392722 maybe some will ask why train them instead of giving them the money needed to start a business of their own we at philippine seven corp believe in the old adage that if we give them fish theyll eat only for a day but if we teach them how to fish theyll eat for the rest of their lives so instead of just doling out handouts we help them gain the knowledge and skill to become self reliant in business

2392728 its in everybodys best interests to try to have the commission respond to us so we can answer these questions and really put it behind us and continue to do the work of the ura and the citizens
2392729 the mayor is not going to get word from the commission
2392730 if he does they will be violating mr fords right to confidentiality
2392731 your failure thus far when you have granted such expediency in the past and possess said authority violates my clients rights
2392732 only the commission may act upon the closing of a preliminary inquiry to date the commission has not acted upon the matter involving your client
2392733 if a formal investigation had been launched pat wouldve been notified and he hasnt been notified
2392734 as a matter of law there cant be an investigation
2392735 leads me to believe that mr contino is operating on a political level which is disturbing
2392736 if in fact mr fishers statements are accurate and correct
2392737 lets let them conclude their investigation and once we do that well make our decisions here on the ura level
2392738 been informed that as the person who provided the initial referral i would be included on any correspondence relating to the closing of a matter
2392739 i dont think youll find a single city taxpayer who wants pat ford to continue to get paid to stay at home
2392740 we wanted antel spa residences to be viewed as truly different from other traditional residential condos because the concept behind the project inspired by a lifestyle devoted to wellness is a truly unique and fresh new take on condominium living
2392741 antel spa was envisioned to fully complement the two other projects of antel land holdings inc allowing us to offer the countrys first self contained lifestyle city
2392742 imagine a home where facilities devoted towards improving and enhancing ones sense of wellness is just a short walk away this is what we are offering to the buyers and future residents of antel spa residences
2392743 our units are priced affordably with the studio set at p2 million 1 bedroom for p2 4 million 2 bedroom for p4 5 million and 3 bedroom from 6 million there are also 8 penthouse units which have areas between of 60 sqm and 100 sqm available
2392744 my feeling is that on one hand company operated salons can be a distraction but on the other hand it keeps you understanding the business company operated stores enable us to try out new ideas before releasing them to the network
2392745 one of the main advantages of having company owned outlets is to enable us to trial new procedures and systems which we are always working on to improve the way we do things trialing them in our own clubs allows us to make sure that all of the problems are ironed out before we roll it out to the franchisees
2392746 the company salons also provide us with a great source of income further to franchise fees alone
2392747 while our company owned clubs are generating healthy profits generally franchised clubs are far more profitable than company owned clubs this has been proven to be the case where we have sold a company owned club to the existing manager and without any change of management staff or location we have seen an immediate increase in both the turnover and profitability
2392748 the franchise model is far more profitable for an owner operator than a corporate store is for the franchisor
2392749 we have also found that if a corporate store is in any way non compliant with the system franchisees use this to justify an endless array of excuses as to why they may do things differently or work outside the system ultimately to its detriment
2392750 company stores allow a franchisor the ability to control and profit from a successful concept they can provide cash flow and a training facility to showcase the business for both the market and other franchisees
2392751 staff cause us the majority of our problems on a day to day basis however i think this again is a burden we need to feel because it is a real problem that faces our franchisees every day how can we give our franchisees advice if we are not gaining any experience in running a salon
2392752 a combination having both management resources and capital tied up can often lead to a poor return on investment most particularly in difficult trading times further challenges exist in ensuring staff perform as well as an invested driven franchisee
2392753 it is fine to have one or maybe two corporate stores to operate as a model and or training store and these can generally be accommodated within the existing infrastructure with little cost impost to the franchise model but if numbers increase over and above these a strict corporate model with specialist infrastructure is required
2392754 hes under a confidentiality agreement with me not to talk to the media about this case
2392755 excited delirium is a convenient fallback for medical examiners coroners and their forensic pathologists around the country

2392757 if someone was down he would bring him up i never saw him depressed

2392760 the congress and bjp are the dominant political parties in the country it has become essential for them to draw some common minimum plan with regard to economic reforms disregarding this need would only increase the problems that the nation is already facing
2392761 when our government presented the relevant bill in parliament the bjp did not oppose it
2392762 the congress and bjp need to have a dialogue in this direction

2392766 it is simply the nature of the beast taxpayer funding puts a budget ceiling on healthcare and with rising life expectancy technological advance and no constraint on demand that budget ceiling is never going to be high enough as a result a tax funded system like the nhs inevitably and unavoidably rations care either through waiting lists or through not offering particular services

2392896 se ha dicho de sir isaac newton que frente al gran oc ano inexplorado de la verdad se sent a como un ni o que recogiera peque as conchas en la playa aquellos de sus sucesores que se enfrascaron en las diversas ramas de la filosof a natural y que yo hab a le do aparec an a mis ojos infantiles como dedicados a una tarea semejante
2392897 liberar al organismo humano de la enfermedad y hacer del hombre un ser invulnerable a todo menos a la muerte violenta fue as como por un tiempo me entregu a los sistemas alquimistas mezclando como un no iniciado multitud de datos contradictorios pataleando desesperadamente en un aut ntico marem gnum de disparatados conocimientos acicateado por una imaginaci n desenfrenada y un razonamiento infantil
2392898 lo que nos explic tuvo la virtud de relegar considerablemente a cornelius agrippa alberto el grande y paracelso los antiguos maestros de mi imaginaci n la desmitificaci n de mis dolos arrebat todo inter s a mis habituales experimentos me parec a que ya nada pod a ser descubierto por uno de estos caprichos del esp ritu a los que sin duda somos m s vulnerables en la juventud abandon todas mis antiguas actividades consideraba que la filosof a natural y cuanto la rodeaba no era m s que una deforme creaci n un aborto esta pretendida ciencia pensaba yo jam s podr superar el nivel m s bajo del aut ntico conocimiento y movido por este estado de nimo me lanc hacia las matem ticas y las ciencias que se relacionaban con ella pues era evidente aquellas materias estaban basadas en fundamentos ciertos y eran por lo tanto dignas de consideraci n
2392899 realmente ha dedicado su tiempo a semejantes estupideces jam s hubiera podido creer que descubrir a en nuestro cient fico siglo a un anacr nico disc pulo de alberto el grande y de paracelso amigo m o no queda otra soluci n que comenzar por el principio
2392900 los antiguos maestros de esta ciencia promet an lo imposible sin conseguir nada los cient ficos modernos prometen poco saben que los metales no pueden ser transmutados y que el elixir de la vida es una quimera sin embargo estos fil sofos cuyas manos parecen servir tan s lo para hurgar en la suciedad y manejar el microscopio o el crisol han conseguido aut nticos prodigios se introducen en las profundidades de la naturaleza y averiguan sus secretos motores han descubierto el firmamento el principio de la circulaci n sangu nea y la composici n del aire que respiramos han logrado poderes nuevos casi ilimitados dominan el rayo determinan los terremotos y descubren algunas veces aspectos del mundo invisible
2392901 la pol tica est llamada a convertirse en una ciencia positiva
2392902 la primera teol gica alcanza su meta cuando se sustituye la acci n providencial del ser nico a las numerosas divinidades que antes hab a imaginado es decir con el monote smo cristiano de igual suerte la filosof a metaf sica obtuvo su t rmino al concebir en lugar de diversas entidades particulares una gran entidad general o sea la naturaleza considerada como la fuente nica de los fen menos su apogeo ser a pues el pante smo materialista as tambi n la filosof a positiva llegar a su perfecci n al poder representar todos los fen menos bajo un solo hecho general por ejemplo la gravitaci n ejemplo admirable de explicaci n positivista es la ley de newton sobre la atracci n universal que permite unificar todos los fen menos astron micos bajo esa ley
2392903 uno de los resultados principales de la forma como se ha desarrollado la historia de la ciencia en el presente siglo siglo xx ha sido la introducci n de una barrera entre las culturas de paracelso y newton nuestra imagen de newton est firmemente asociada con los valores de la ilustraci n y del mundo moderno mientras que el nombre del enigm tico e inaccesible paracelso conlleva la extra a asociaci n de una mente torturada que lucha de manera infructuosa por escapar de los laberintos de los siglos oscuros existe la tendencia a generalizar las diferencias entre la oscura poca del precopernicanismo y la ilustraci n del newtonismo
2392904 porque contemplaba al universo y todo lo que en l se contiene como un enigma como un secreto que pod a leerse aplicando el pensamiento puro a cierta evidencia a ciertos indicios m sticos que dios hab a diseminado por el mundo para permitir una especie de b squeda del tesoro filos fico a la hermandad esot rica cre a que una parte de dichos indicios deb a encontrarse en la evidencia de los cielos y en la constituci n de los elementos y la otra en ciertos escritos y tradiciones transmitidos por los miembros de una hermandad en una cadena ininterrumpida desde la original revelaci n cr ptica en babilonia consideraba al universo como un criptograma trazado por el todopoderoso
2392905 cuanto m s se examinan las obras teol gicas cronol gicas y mitol gicas de newton como un todo puestas a la par de su ciencia m s claro se observa que en sus momentos de grandeza se vio a s mismo como el ltimo de los int rpretes de la voluntad de dios en acci n viviendo en la v spera de la consumaci n de los tiempos
2392906 si esas creencias anticuadas deben denominarse mitos entonces stos se pueden producir por medio de los mismos tipos de razones que conducen en la actualidad al conocimiento cient fico por otra parte si debemos considerarlos como ciencia entonces sta habr incluido conjuntos de creencias absolutamente incompatibles con las que tenemos en la actualidad
2392907 a trazar l neas diferentes de desarrollo para las ciencias que frecuentemente nada tienen de acumulativas
2392908 su esquema formal es sencillo y f cil de captar en sus l neas generales su adopci n su adaptaci n y manejo tampoco resultan complicados su estructura l gica es cautivadora para cualquier mente filos fica l gica o cient fica ya que nos es familiar en sus postulados y en sus conclusiones sin embargo dif cilmente resiste a la cr tica cuando se ha analizado un per odo determinado de la historia de la ciencia o cuando se ha abordado el estudio de un tema cualquiera la realidad del pasado cient fico de la humanidad parece ser m s compleja por estar m s sujeta a cierto tipo de variables hasta hace poco descartadas de los esquemas de la historiograf a positiva aunque contemplamos en conjunto toda esa trayectoria cient fica del ser humano es obvio que los patrones positivistas se muestran inconsistentes al intentar definiciones generales a todos los per odos y a todos los lugares en estos ltimos a os dentro de las diversas corrientes de la historiograf a de las ciencias han comenzado a percibirse otras tendencias que no consideran a la ciencia como un saber puramente acumulativo y a su historia como el relato de ese proceso de acumulaci n
2392909 representan evidentemente esquemas simplificados ya que desde el siglo xvi hasta mediados del xviii la simple confrontaci n de unos con otros produjo m ltiples variantes e interrelaciones as como diversos subgrupos y distintas escuelas de pensamiento en realidad la divisi n convencional en tres tradiciones exclusivamente s lo intenta se alar que la revoluci n cient fica se dio en el contexto no de una sino de varias estructuras de pensamiento cada una de stas tuvo su peculiar m todo de experimentaci n as como su propio lenguaje
2392910 muchas veces sobre todo dentro de la corriente herm tica los t rminos utilizados parecen estar cargados de magia superstici n y fantas a pero un an lisis m s detallado y circunspecto puede revelar toda una interpretaci n de la naturaleza no carente de precisi n y objetividad
2392911 en esta labor hab a que buscar los enlaces ocultos las tramas invisibles de los fen menos las relaciones num ricas y matem ticas que explicaban la armon a del cosmos ya que los secretos del universo hab an sido escritos por dios en lenguaje matem tico y m stico toda esta concepci n del mundo f sico tuvo imponderables consecuencias en el campo de las ciencias figuras como cop rnico tycho brahe y kepler en astronom a paracelso glauber y van helmont en qu mica y medicina y gilbert en f sica no son sino unos cuantos nombres de relieve dentro de la gran cantidad de cient ficos que se sintieron atra dos por esta corriente la cual a simple vista parec a ser la menos racional y l gica de las tres pero que a la luz de sus contribuciones a la revoluci n cient fica del siglo xvii bien pudiera ser que comparta junto con las doctrinas mecanicistas un lugar preeminente todav a quedan por evaluar las aportaciones de lo que podr amos denominar corriente herm tico mecanicista a la eclosi n cient fica de ese siglo
2392912 sus demostraciones eran claras y matem ticamente impecables e inteligibles a ella se adscribieron figuras como galileo mersenne descartes y newton aunque cabe se alar que a veces en la obra de estos sabios apuntan destellos herm ticos que resultan interesantes el rigor y claridad de sus trabajos hizo que los paradigmas mecanicistas triunfaran definitivamente hacia mediados del siglo xviii desde entonces las ciencias se rigen en base a sus hip tesis y teor as
2392913 es m s realista aceptar la duraci n de la influencia de figuras como paracelso y reconocer que los cient ficos de generaciones posteriores no consideraban por fuerza las ideas de la tradici n no mecanicista como reliquias de una edad oscura fuera de moda y cient ficamente improductiva s lo hasta hace poco los historiadores de la ciencia debido en gran medida a est mulos externos han comenzado a darse cuenta de las desventajas que significa para su profesi n eliminar de la historia a figuras como paracelso

2392945 the side effects that have been reported are real and they cannot be brushed aside
2392946 physicians have a responsibility to communicate risks to patients and if patients and families are concerned it is reasonable to hold off on vaccinating
2392947 the scientific work to date seems to suggest that aluminum salts in vaccines are safe
2392948 merck has analyzed the adverse events reported for gardasil relating to the recent reports of death and paralysis and based on the data available to merck believes that no safety issue related to the vaccine has been identified these types of events are events that could also be seen in the general population

2392950 i worry about the kids who may be having problems are perhaps struggling with immune damage and are feeling generally achy and unwell but are probably going unreported and undiagnosed
2392951 pasteur was widely supported but on his death bed conceded that beauchamp was right
2392952 even if everyone was vaccinated we would still have cervical cancer
2392953 i dont want people to be lulled into thinking this will prevent cancer if pap screening rates decline cervical cancer rates will rise
2392954 these types of pictures will soon disappear in clinical oncology
2392955 no one would want to wait to see cervical cancer develop in participants
2392956 but the general failure to mention that the precancerous lesions chosen for study are not only potentially removable most those that are cin 2 would probably have resolved on their own without any intervention is arguable
2392957 while vaccine proponents emphasize the many thousands of women who participated in clinical trials of the product they gloss over how few young girls in the 9 to 13 year age range targeted specifically for school based immunizations were included
2392958 we are simply still in the early stages of investigation
2392959 there is no question that early detection will continue to be a key element
2392960 yo why do alot of people tend to be tentative about giving they numbers out on the space when they give it to people in a public setting
2392961 what exactly are the winning parameters for a war against terrorism terror or muslim terrorists
2392962 for over seven years the united states has been occupying the lands of islam in the holiest of places the arabian peninsula plundering its riches dictating to its rulers humiliating its people terrorizing its neighbors and turning its bases in the peninsula into a spearhead through which to fight the neighboring muslim peoples
2392963 despite the great devastation inflicted on the iraqi people by the crusader zionist alliance and despite the huge number of those killed which has exceeded 1 million despite all this the americans are once again trying to repeat the horrific massacres as though they are not content with the protracted blockade imposed after the ferocious war or the fragmentation and devastation
2392964 if the americans aims behind these wars are religious and economic the aim is also to serve the jews petty state and divert attention from its occupation of jerusalem and murder of muslims there the best proof of this is their eagerness to destroy iraq the strongest neighboring arab state and their endeavor to fragment all the states of the region such as iraq saudi arabia egypt and sudan into paper statelets and through their disunion and weakness to guarantee israels survival and the continuation of the brutal crusade occupation of the peninsula
2392965 all these crimes and sins committed by the americans are a clear declaration of war on god his messenger and muslims and ulema have throughout islamic history unanimously agreed that the jihad is an individual duty if the enemy destroys the muslim countries on that basis and in compliance with gods order we issue the following fatwa to all muslims the ruling to kill the americans and their allies civilians and military is an individual duty for every muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it in order to liberate the al aqsa mosque and the holy mosque mecca from their grip and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of islam defeated and unable to threaten any muslim
2392966 the greatest rule of safety is justice and stopping injustice and aggression what happened on 11 september and 11 march the madrid train bombings is your commodity that was returned to you we would like to inform you that labeling us and our acts as terrorism is also a description of you and of your acts our acts are reaction to your own acts which are represented by the destruction and killing of our kinfolk in afghanistan iraq and palestine which religion considers your killed ones innocent and our killed ones worthless and which principle considers your blood real blood and our blood water reciprocal treatment is fair and the one who starts injustice bears greater blame the killing of russians was after their invasion of afghanistan and chechnya the killing of europeans was after their invasion of iraq and afghanistan and the killing of americans on the day of new york was after their support of the jews in palestine and their invasion of the arabian peninsula

2392970 money enters the system of values and then displaces all other values like a cuckoo in a nest
2392971 for that is the end of economics the world reduced to a scorching slum its women to whores its men to murderers
2392972 the romantics reminded us of the evil of money how the habit of calculating and making comparisons in money diminishes much that is strange and precious in creation indeed abolishes quality itself as a mental category by which to understand reality displaces trust in people by trust in money and thus poisons the relations between human beings and atomises society and submerges being in possessing
2392973 these contradictions lie at the heart of the great sadness of our civilisation that by using money we convert our world into it humanity is estranged by money from its natural habitat without any hope of appeal we are also estranged by money from one another it is this sense of a community of people atomised by money where all human relations are disrupted by money that is the second great romantic legacy to our age
2392974 a social system that evaluated men and women in terms of money and made morality a function of credit was unworthy of the human being

2393010 these treatments are cheap but common if you total all the money time and effort spent on them its considerable
2393011 it is very important that we have a strong evidence base to support the treatments that are offered to infertile couples and as such this study is very valuable
2393012 intrauterine insemination has been offered to couples with unexplained infertility for many years but if there is no benefit in doing so then we should re evaluate the clinical guidelines so that nhs money is used wisely

2393093 the concept had been on the table for some years now all countries have finally agreed on the formation and implementation of the saarc food bank
2393094 properly realised it would serve as a milestone in strengthening the existing cooperation among the nations of south asia
2393095 this involves the construction of new food warehouses in member countries local procurement and the international purchase of extra food grains and developing an administrative system and a distribution network so it is likely that it will take some time before operationalising the saarc food bank

2393100 but it is critical that we maintain these access levels to keep supplies moving the situation in the areas is very fluid and un supplies to these people are vital
2393101 over the past week wfp transported 130mt of dhal and 10mt of vegetable oil from vavuniya for its ongoing dry ration distribution in kilinochchi and mullaitivu districts under tiger control
2393102 the general security situation in kilinochchi and mullaitivu districts remains tense and unpredictable due to ongoing military operations and exchange of mortar artillery shelling around the northern and southern forward defence line areas claymore mine attacks and air attacks deep inside the vanni area
2393103 because of the security situation it is sometimes difficult for government agencies to maintain supplies and they need all the assistance they can get
2393104 we dont have access to these people still in the areas of the fighting and we dont have exact figures
2393105 if we can provide a corridor for these people to move back into their villages or to areas south of the fighting it would make supplying them with aid easier the rains will also come in the next two months and the situation could get bad

2393147 john mccain was 42 she cindy was 24 during the next nine months he would fly to arizona or she would come to the washington area where mccain and carol had a home
2393148 mccain did not sue his wife for divorce until feb
2393149 mccain obtained an arizona marriage license on march 6 1980 while still legally married to his first wife
2393150 so youre saying mccain didnt really cheat on his wife and his wife was ok with it
2393151 these three have been usage items for many years all are standard and have long been so different to is limited to british english however but only different from seems never to meet objections she is different from her mother in many ways he feels different from the way he did yesterday you look different from him different than has been much criticized by commentators but is nonetheless standard at most levels except for some edited english consider she looks different than she did yesterday hes different than me some additional purist discomfort may arise here you look different than he him the problem lies in the assumption that than should be only a subordinating conjunction requiring the pronouns that follow to be the nominative case subjects of their clauses and not a preposition requiring the pronouns that follow to be the objective case objects of the preposition but standard english does use than as both preposition and conjunction she looks different than me is standard and so is she looks different than i do and with comparative forms of adjectives than occurs with great frequency she looks taller older better thinner etc than me than i do still best advice for formal and oratorical levels stick with different from
2393152 now sure just about all of our politicians lie and cheat even if they arent having affairs but once there is proof of an affair then there can be no pretense of honesty
2393153 john edwards cheats on his wife then lies about it

2393158 i am a bus driver with the state transit authority of nsw and want to commend all the pilgrims who are in our state for world youth day celebrations on friday night i together with other drivers were called to attend moore park to assist in the conveyance of pilgrims back to central railway station upon completing this task we were directed by radio control to return back to our respective bus depots but near central i observed a large number of pilgrims nuns literally shivering in the cold waiting for their designated bus i motioned for the sisters to jump on as i was willing to take them much to their relief
2393159 they all thought they had won the lottery and jumped up and down with delight when i told them that i would take them home during my travel along elizabeth st in surry hills i picked up more pilgrims waiting for buses then all along cleveland st i stopped and picked up more pilgrims on reaching anzac parade at moore park there was an extremely large number of pilgrims waiting in the cold for a bus given the sheer number of pilgrims i had on my bus it was completely full i asked who was getting off where so i could form a travel plan there were the original sisters getting off at kensington then some for kingsford maroubra the spot randwick junction and clovelly during the trip one young lady approached me and said for your kind generosity of getting us out of the cold and making sure we get home all of us would like to present you with a little gift to show our appreciation we have all chipped in
2393160 at this point i almost broke down in tears after returning to my depot i had a look inside and what i saw is indicative of what these pilgrims are really about inside were chocolate bars a bottle of water scarfs and bandannas from texas wydo8 scarfs an apple an orange a banana australian souvenirs a packet of chips a souvenir key ring from texas and various other nice things but the one thing that really struck me was that i found a mcdonalds food voucher

2393164 we wanted to produce a large number of disease models for ourselves our collaborators and the stem cell research community to accelerate research
2393165 the original embryonic stem cell lines are generic and allow you to ask only basic questions but these new lines are valuable tools for attacking the root causes of disease our work is just the beginning for studying thousands of diseases in a petri dish
2393166 the core will also function as a technical laboratory to produce these disease specific lines for use by scientists around the world
2393167 the suite of ips cell lines reported by the daley group marks an important achievement and a very significant advance for patients suffering from degenerative diseases these disease specific ips cells are invaluable tools that will allow researchers to watch the development diseases in petri dishes outside of the patients and we have good reason to believe that this will make it possible to find new treatments and eventually drugs to slow or even stop the course of a number of diseases in years ahead
2393168 this report will be seen as opening the door to a new approach to develop therapies
2393169 one of our goals in creating the nih directors pioneer award programs was to enable exceptionally creative scientists to move quickly in promising new directions thereby speeding the intellectual and technical breakthroughs needed to address major challenges in biomedical or behavioral research
2393170 this is certainly the case for drs daley and hochedlinger who deployed their directors award resources to advance our ability to use induced pluripotent stem cells for disease specific studies and drug development
2393171 the cell lines available from the ips core will allow stem cell researchers around the world to explore possible gene therapies for some conditions and will aid in the development of drugs for others
2393172 the output is a very clear understanding of what the system should look like the project has developed an entire system concept and a related reference design for a future air interface this can be used as input for the standardisation process that is now starting
2393173 no one had anything to lose and therefore we could start a joint development of a new system where everyone could bring in their ideas
2393174 we started more or less from zero so everyone could gain something
2393175 our industry partners went to the lte standardisation and many organisations have taken winner results because we already achieved some consensus there these kinds of projects are supporting consensus building
2393176 basically youll get in a wireless system a similar experience as in your office or your home
2393177 in europe this may not happen before 2015 though in some countries it could be earlier
2393178 it really depends on conditions in different countries and also on market needs of course
2393179 asia is still growing fast but in ten years they will also have a saturated market the need then will be to improve the capabilities of systems from an industry perspective we have to offer innovative solutions in order to stay competitive in the global market
2393180 i think we have to work hard of course but there is a good chance because we have the people the know how and the means for this kind of co operation
2393181 what industry has to do is invest in research and development in order to stay inventive
2393182 technology is always moving its always improving we can decide either to be in the group which is improving and innovating or we are not in that group i think its better to be in the group thats improving
2393183 this research can benefit parents teachers and other individuals working with children as it can allow them to set realistic expectations for and better interpret childrens everyday behavior

2393187 developing an accurate model of ice would help architects civil engineers and environmental engineers understand what happens to structures and systems exposed to freezing conditions
2393188 it could also help us understand and better predict the movement of glaciers
2393189 but they just stop where they happen to lie in different configurations throughout the crystal with no correlation between them and no single one lowers the energy enough to take over and reduce the entropy to zero
2393190 the original spin ice research went from one part of the periodic table to a more flexible one
2393191 but artificial spin ice goes off the periodic table altogether
2393192 it mimics the behavior of real ice but is completely designable with specific properties
2393193 we can change the strength of the spin or reformulate the alloy to change the magnetic properties which creates new bulk properties that we either couldnt get from normal materials or couldnt control at the atomic level
2393194 this is the first time the rules of ice behavior have ever been rigorously confirmed by directly counting pseudo hydrogen atoms
2393195 we can track the position and movement of each pseudo atom in our model see where defects occur in the lattice and simulate what happens over much longer periods of time
2393196 our meta material is very similar to patterned hard disk media magnetic bits used in hard drives are usually placed at random but memory density could be increased if they were in a tight regular pattern instead
2393197 weve found that both hydrogen in ice and the pseudo hydrogen in our artificial spin ice also behave as bits can carry information and interact with each other perhaps in the future engineers will be inspired by this in their hard drive designs the formal patterning and bit interactions may actually help to stabilize information ultimately leading to drives with much higher capacities

2393226 its all about allocating working memory to the things that are most important
2393227 when something grabs our attention we automatically divert some of our working memory to it in case it turns out to be important in other words it gets the lions share of memory resources
2393228 when we look at a scene we dont remember every detail only the broad gist and one or two specific details
2393229 we allocate very small portions of our memory to the background and far more to the important details if you test people you find that they have very little knowledge of the details of what they just saw because their visual memory is so limited
2393230 limited memory puts clear limitations on what we actually see rather than what we think we see seeing involves looking at objects and storing them briefly in our working memory but that memory is incredibly small so what we actually see is extremely restricted our vision is determined not just by what we look at but by our memory of the scene
2393231 when we decide to look at an object we clearly perceive it as being significant and reallocate our memory to it
2393232 so even though we havent looked at it yet we still remember more about it than the object weve just looked at
2393233 part of the reason these patients may not be aware of objects is because they have very severe limitations in their visual working memory capacity
2393234 without memory devoted to some parts of the visual field patients dont see objects there

2393264 the global burden of climate change attributable diarrhea and malnutrition are already the largest in the world in southeastern asian countries including bangladesh bhutan india maldives myanmar and nepal
2393265 illness and death are expected to increase from diarrheal diseases due to drought and flooding and are also expected from increased amounts of cholera bacteria in coastal waters
2393266 rather than slowing down the problem is accelerating there is a crisis of inaction in addressing and preparing for climate change

2393269 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2393270 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2393271 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2393272 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

2393318 the precedent that this creates for isps in other areas and also the fact that disconnecting people from the internet is not in our view a proportionate response to copyright infringement

2393320 but for someone to simply compile lists of ip addresses fire them off to isps on a weekly basis and expect action to be taken on that basis is really going beyond what even the copyright law in australia would require

2393333 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
2393334 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank
2393335 i think some people would contend that because we have continued to make a sizable investment there hasnt been a proper incentive until now for the iraqi government to make its own investment

2393374 first parrhesia occurs as an activity in the framework of small groups of people or in the context of community life secondly parrhesia can be seen in human relationships occurring in the framework of public life and finally parrhesia occurs in the context of individual personal relationships
2393375 parrhesia is thus not a characteristic competency strategy of a single person but rather a concatenation of positions within the framework of the relationship between the parrhesiastes criticism and the self criticism evoked by here parrhesia is not the competency of a subject but rather a movement my emphasize between the position that queries the concordance of logos and bios and the position that exercises self criticism in light of this query parrhesia as a double strategy is needed as an attempt of involvement and engagement in a process of hazardous refutation and as self questioning

2393394 said this morning before the game that schmidt is probably done for 2008
2393395 as it is im not convinced that they wont shoot themselves in the foot joe torre loves him some juan pierre and pierre has enough superficially impressive statistics that torre may have a hard time letting go throw in that pierre has led off 55 of the 56 dodger games for which hes been active since rafael furcal was injured and i am in no way convinced that ramirezs playing time will come at the expense of slappy im not sure torre can conceive of a lineup with the eight guys hell have if he doesnt play pierre because theres not a leadoff hitter in the bunch for each game andre ethier or matt kemp sits in favor of pierre the dodgers give back a little bit of the value of what they traded for it wouldnt take much of that to make even a great putt lip out at the end leaving the dodgers sitting seven or perhaps seven games back and wondering what happened
2393396 lets start with something simple and easy andre ethier is a much better baseball player than juan pierre is juan pierre steals bases better than ethier does and the two players defense is about a wash ethier gets on base more and hits for so much more power that the difference dwarfs everything else about the two hence the 26 point edge in eqa ethier was also better last year and has been the better player than pierre from the moment he stepped into the league this isnt a debatable point andre ethier is a better baseball player than juan pierre hes also a better player than andruw jones a point that seems obvious enough that ill spare you a chart ilustrating the concept even in the face of that kind of obvious info pierre starts over ethier because torre likes veterans and torre likes speed
2393397 torre genuinely thinks the dodgers are a better team with pierre batting leadoff than they are in other configurations lets disabuse him of that notion pierre led off every single dodger game from may 6 through june 29 when he hurt his knee he batted 261 299 296 a truly awful line that included just 10 walks in 215 plate appearances remember though hes willing to take pitches its almost impossible to bat 261 and not have an obp or slg above 300 but pierre did it for nearly two months he gives a professional at bat on a regular basis thats also how he led off every day playing complete games in 46 of 49 contests and scored 20 runs in that time two zero as bil burke reports no team in the national league got worse run production from its leadoff spot during that time the argument that pierres poor rate stats dont accurately capture his skills is false he isnt a good leadoff hitter who generates runs via his speed hes not on base enough and because hes not on base enough both he and his team are poor at scoring runs when he bats leadoff batting juan pierre leadoff is to bring back a term baseball malpractice
2393398 while pierre was on the disabled list the dodgers primarily used matt kemp in the leadoff spot they scored 95 runs in the 20 games pierre missed 4 5 per game which is in line with the expectations for this team nevertheless when pierre returned torre installed him as the leadoff man in five straight games they scored 19 runs and eight of 10 scoring 33 runs including the two in which he played instead of andre ethier as manny ramirez added to the outfield logjam conclusions how about three andre ethier is better than juan pierre juan pierre has a case for being the worst leadoff hitter in the game the dodger offense grinds to a halt when juan pierre bats leadoff if the dodgers fail to reach the postseason it will be in part because furcal got hurt you cant just ignore that part of the equation but it will be just as much because joe torre elected to kneecap his offense by putting a bad baseball player in a critical role and stubbornly sticking with that decision despite what it was doing to his offense no amount of geniality experience speed or hustle can counter the statistics above when anybody but juan pierre leads off the dodgers score 50 percent more runs than they do when pierre leads off consistently

2393426 they removed some of the requirements for xbla games but there are still a lot of requirements
2393427 and i believe that at least for a single player game like my game the vast majority of these requirements are unnecessary
2393428 i put in a tremendous amount of work meeting all these requirements when i could have put that work into the actual game and made it even a little more polished little bit better
2393429 i definitely had a couple of unpleasant business interactions with microsoft
2393430 nothing horrible well nothing quite bad enough to cause me to cancel releasing the game on arcade but what would keep me from putting another game on arcade again is just that theyve changed the business deal at least as ive heard
2393431 they didnt try to dictate the game design as many publishers might they were very hands off there and what is in the final game is exactly what i wanted to put there
2393432 they also bent a lot of xbla rules in order to help me make the game the way i wanted which was pretty cool of them for the most part working with microsoft has been great

2393437 to take a break from the tour it was a reward for them to get away and his way of saying thanks for all their hard work
2393438 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2393439 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2393440 why would someone take me less seriously as a performer when they find out i crochet
2393441 when i wake up in the morning and look in the mirror this is my challenge
2393442 i want to win on a road course and its the last chance i have this year to do it thats what it really boils down to
2393443 i just want more laps to get in the rhythm of road course racing i seem to have the pace for a handful of laps doing the right thing
2393444 im not sure if its being overaggressive what that really is i keep searching for it i cant find that half a tenth i just need more seat time
2393445 we qualified well at sonoma and we led at the beginning but we didnt race in traffic like we wanted to
2393446 this race here is very important for the points but its more of a personal challenge for myself and crew chief chad knaus its a race that were looking at to help us down the road we want to get out of here with a decent finish
2393447 every great driver wants to feel like they can win at every track they go to
2393448 jimmie is an awesome driver he proves it every weekend hes in the same equipment that im in so i can appreciate it more so than a lot of people can
2393449 road courses are not easy to win on i feel like theyve had some opportunities to win and they havent worked out hes been getting better and better when we go test hes usually faster than me i feel like its just a matter of time more than anything
2393450 the crazy thing is i do better in these other vehicles than i do in the cup car i just have to figure out how
2393451 it just shows how hard it is to stay on top weve put a lot of hard work in and have established ourselves as a contender
2393452 i never thought i would win at richmond and finally conquered that track it would be extremely satisfying to win at watkins glen
2393453 as much as we can talk about what our cars are doing and what were looking for in setups we do all that we can there
2393454 but when you get in the car and youre looking for a half a tenth of a second per corner and it totals up to a three or four tenths advantage from start to finish of a lap its really tough to communicate those things
2393455 its such a small difference its just a little everywhere i just need to do it more
2393456 query is not the most obvious name for this variable
2393457 here unless i know smalltalk i may wonder how come
2393458 hm i had to think about this a bit how and why it works

2393464 i believe in renewable fuels i dont believe in ethanol subsidies but i believe in renewable fuels
2393465 im not hitting the ball as good as i was last year but ive learned a lot
2393466 the game is simpler and even though i still make mistakes all the time i know what they are now and its much easier to fix them than it was before its a slow process but i feel like im learning and thats what being in the minors is all about
2393467 my swing is not the same as it was last year at all
2393468 the coaches here edgar alfonzo and guadalupe jabalera know me better than anyone the coaches in st lucie are just starting to know what to expect from me over the past week ive worked really hard and i feel a lot better about my game and im looking forward to going back to work

2393485 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2393486 i took responsibility for my actions back then i take full responsibility now publicly
2393487 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2393488 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2393489 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2393490 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2393491 thats the game of the year im not going to lie even though were going to take it one by one georgia is the game of the year

2393517 what am i gonna do no wife no work no reason to live
2393518 oh hey is your store hiring i want to work at best buy
2393519 no you dont want to work at best buy because you will eventually lose your mind from pressure selling stupid fucking catch phrases like
2393520 hey lp yeah its me in home life hey i am taking out a blue 8 gig ipod nano maybe after i walk this product up to the front lanes for the customer you and the manager standing next to me could walk me into the bathroom and assist me with wiping my ass that would be fantastic thanks
2393521 did you offer the complete solution did you offer the extended warranty did you get to know your customer their name address social security number their pant size do they have children a dog did you please them orally anything to get a sale
2393522 what you only sold a 52 inch sony xbr 120 ghz 1080p flat panel what about a calibration what about the extended warranty did you offer a best buy branded payment what about the bluray player that they dont even want why didnt you make them want that what a shitty sale youre fired
2393523 our current use it or lose it system for fers employees hurts productivity and increases training costs
2393524 we need to be incentivizing the accrual of sick leave not encouraging people to call in sick in the weeks leading up to retirement
2393525 this is a very welcome and important step toward correcting some of the disparity in treatment of employees who often work side by side
2393526 this speaks to the federal workforce and the level of maturity
2393527 the roth is something that created some significant concerns for us because it is expensive but we also recognize that there are members of the tsp who would benefit from it
2393528 i know there are some folks on capitol hill who would like us to move faster but we need to do our homework before we move
2393529 and i feel very good about the way tsp assets are managed based on the information we have today
2393530 there is a role for these exceptions but their extensive use may have implications for the future and agencies need to be aware of this when they create their recruitment strategies
2393531 a product of convenience or coincidence rather than the result of a thoughtful or deliberate choice to effectively use the most appropriate hiring authority
2393532 we have a different standard than the average private sector company
2393533 if the public thinks were targeting specific groups or hiring someones cousin that undermines our credibility and the perception of the work we perform
2393534 extensive use of any authority that results in a disproportionate workforce should be balanced with other authorities to ensure that a pattern does not develop of hiring from only select groups
2393535 the federal government is supposed to be a model employer with hiring practices that focus solely on merit principles
2393536 but this report demonstrates that the foundation of the merit principles established more than 125 years ago that ended the patronage system is under siege
2393537 its hard to tell young people the skys the limit when they look up and dont see anyone
2393538 kids ive spoken to who choose to do supply who choose to do lawyer who choose to do admin have the impression that if i go to army and become an infantry person that is not a skill that i can carry to the civilian work force
2393539 they want to prepare for a future outside of the military and they believe that being in communications being in logistics will provide them a better opportunity to succeed
2393540 that tells me honestly over the years the pipeline for those blacks going to general officer is not going to be markedly improved above what it is now
2393541 im joining this rotc thing so that when i get out in four years or eight years whatever time frame it is i want a skill i can use
2393542 its all about how many people you put in the front end of the pipe
2393543 its very difficult for anybody to get to be a colonel or general in any branch of the service if you dont have enough young officers coming in
2393544 we treasure diversity because it brings in a lot of different viewpoints and blends in a lot of cultures
2393545 talk about the opportunities that are offered and how those opportunities can help them in their quest to be successful people
2393546 he insisted i take my command qualifications test and when i didnt do good he had me take it again
2393547 you cant get lazy in this man and this womans navy
2393548 the federal government has begun an important cultural transformation in how it manages its most important asset its people
2393549 such transformation does take time understanding and accepting the systems being implemented takes a shift we owe the american taxpayer something to show they are getting value for their hard earned dollar
2393550 employee buy in is essential to the governments effectiveness and efficiency
2393551 if employees are not involved and their concerns are not addressed morale will drop and hinder agency mission
2393552 successful implementation of performance based pay has come only after substantial effort but has resulted in transformed performance cultures that are much more results oriented than previously
2393553 employees are not necessarily satisfied with their pay they do not understand the basis for decisions and many do not see meaningful distinctions in their evaluations
2393554 you say pay for performance programs are a success our reading is not along those lines
2393555 what we find in the surveys is most of our respondents do believe that performance should be a factor in determining pay
2393556 in the areas where the implementation has not been at the level that we would expect that doesnt negate the premise that people believe their performance should be recognized
2393557 about 50 percent of the intelligence community has five years or less of service to be quite blunt theyre not going to have the patience to stay with us for a system that has a 10 year timeline
2393558 i dont know of a single so called pay for performance system that is getting good reviews from the employees who are working under it
2393559 im going to get the transcripts of what mr gage and ms kelley had to say today and get them over to the departments and get to the bottom of this
2393560 this has been a labor of love for nteu its been in progress for well over a year
2393561 the announcements were designed with the effort to get the attention in a very short time frame of those who may never think once much less twice about the valuable work done by federal employees
2393562 incorporate it into what they are doing to build and support the federal workforce
2393563 americans should be proud of the caliber of the people in this country who are called to public service
2393564 they make up the most diverse best educated workforce in america and they do it all for us every day
2393565 while we applaud the plans of dod to expand leadership opportunities for career senior executives the move illustrates the problems inherent in the ses pay system
2393566 congress and the next administration will ultimately have to address the need to raise the ses pay cap if we are to continue to attract and retain the caliber of career leadership the federal government needs
2393567 at worst threaten to create pay compression anew as executives reach the caps for their tiers and at best require clarity and transparency with regard to the criteria for placement within a tier and for promotion to the next tier
2393568 with the higher costs of gas i am pleased that gsa was able to move swiftly on increasing mileage reimbursements on the heels of the internal revenue service announcement
2393569 federal employees should not have to pay out of pocket to do their jobs the reimbursement rate should adequately reflect workers costs so they do not have to subsidize the federal government
2393570 to automatically match irs rate changes and reduce redundancy and expedite the process
2393571 theres a lot that needs to be done to achieve that enviable goal of being seen by the overall organization as adding significant value the overwhelming majority of hr organizations dont have a strategic plan of any sort how do you get strategic if you dont have a strategic plan
2393572 youre losing skill sets as people retire who are operating legacy systems
2393573 human resources leaders are at least now beginning to look at what their options are
2393574 opm should be just a wonderful resource that you can tap to determine best practices best policies best use of technology
2393575 as opposed to necessarily serving as the hr cops just enforcing certain policies and practices
2393576 public sector agencies lag seriously behind in recruiting and retaining people with disabilities
2393577 to call this result perplexing is at the least an understatement research has demonstrated that the typical individual with a disability is a more engaged more loyal and more technologically adept employee than the average worker in the general population
2393578 the impending retirement crisis certainly supplies the strategic justification for engaging this population more proactively let alone assessing its potential more fairly and objectively
2393579 these veiled prejudices are confidence drainers for the disabled candidate too they know better than anyone how the snap judgments of hiring managers can shatter their chance to win a job
2393580 weve found that candidates and particularly candidates with disabilities feel empowered by this prejudice free zone if you will and tend to present their true potential more confidently
2393581 were all so accustomed to making ourselves clear in purely textual modes that we forget how effective the use of other communications styles can be
2393582 broadening your agencys communication bandwidth to include what has come to be known as rich media can enrich your interaction not with generation y a no brainer but with team members with certain disabilities as well
2393583 the chief financial officer legislation was passed many years ago because someone said money was important and the chief information officer passed because it was important
2393584 well the passing of the chco legislation showed that human capital the people of an organization is important
2393585 the truth is not having enough people or resources forces us to rethink how we get our work done
2393586 it forces us to think about new technology solutions and it forces us to think about not trying to do the work the way weve always done it
2393587 were down to 61 000 employees down from 85 000 at one point
2393588 i dont think anyone would say that either of these presidential candidates would turn their back on people
2393589 in january the new political leadership coming in will have the benefit of fresh data from the federal workforce
2393590 the 2008 survey data of the federal workforce will be able to create a basis on which not only the chcos but all agency leaders will know where to focus
2393591 who can argue against paying our employees for the performance they bring to the organization every day
2393592 we are watching and learning from other agencies to see how we can best bring pay for performance into our organization but performance management is our key and thats where we are now
2393593 we believe that the continual loss of agents will negatively affect the divisions productivity in the near future
2393594 there are laws and regulations on the need to go out and hire and recruit people with disabilities
2393595 we have more of a hook frankly our hook is that we actually have laws and regulations that say to the federal government you need to do a good job in this area and frankly despite these laws were doing a terrible job
2393596 why is it that i have all these great programs im very accountable and we havent reached that 2 percent
2393597 how many have you ever watched the show the biggest loser thats how i feel sometimes i do all this work and i dont see the change in the numbers
2393598 its a brilliant way to fill those needs because everyones retiring
2393599 you bring them in as a summer hire or a temp but the manager gets used to them the workforce gets used to them and they break down barriers youve been working with them for two years so hire them
2393600 hi she enjoys entertaining people at target and any other store with her newfound verbal abilities everyone is charmed by it
2393601 when i was growing up class was clearly defined you knew where you were in the pecking order you knew your place mine was lowly now we have a disparity between people and no social movement footballers and pop stars have got rich through talent and energy and bravado but havent taken the working class with them people do feel they are at the bottom of the pile
2393602 its always been the same those who do the work versus those who own the wealth the slave owners had their land and the slaves tilled it in the end i think marx had it right
2393603 does money now mean more than class ask yourself what is the first thing new money does it puts its sons down for eton and buys a stately home money has not killed off the old class system it is fuelling its survival into a new century
2393604 class has always been about money breeding has now been exposed it is now just a commodity itself where i live even the middle class is a redundant term whether you can afford access to leisure activities or pay your bills defines your class
2393605 its rather discouraging that people give a degree of respect for grand fortunes and not grand titles people like roman abramovich get enormous amounts of respect and dukes dont
2393606 im truly one of few and fortunate to have that kind of demographic three generations in the audience happens whenever i play except the casinos its one of the perks of four decades in the business
2393607 they hired us as actors and after the network picked up the pilot i grabbed my guitar and went to the producers and said look ive been in bands all my life i play and i sing i think i should do it in the show they bought it
2393608 there are the partridge hits of course and an acoustic set with just me and a guitar but i like to keep everything spontaneous its not so much a performance i hate those scripted things as it is about the beauty and magic of interacting the set list changes with every show more rock less rock more soulful its all about spontaneity and passion
2393609 hanging out with the hard boots those are the guys from kentucky who take care of things ive been in the business for 30 years but under a fake name its only recently that i started using my real name with the business

2393613 the canadian government and michael wernick the top ranking indian affairs civil servant needs to reign in their indian affairs bureaucrats who are out of control threatening to flagrantly violate our constitutionally protected rights to customary governance
2393614 i dont think its right for any government to interfere this way
2393615 the government should respect our traditions and customs and continue with the negotiation and implementation of the signed agreements
2393616 the canadian government and michael wernick the top ranking indian affairs civil servant needs to reign in their indian affairs bureaucrats who are out of control threatening to flagrantly violate our constitutionally protected rights to customary governance
2393617 i dont think its right for any government to interfere this way

2393619 the canadian government and michael wernick the top ranking indian affairs civil servant needs to reign in their indian affairs bureaucrats who are out of control threatening to flagrantly violate our constitutionally protected rights to customary governance
2393620 i dont think its right for any government to interfere this way
2393621 the government should respect our traditions and customs and continue with the negotiation and implementation of the signed agreements
2393622 we strongly believe societies which allow free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2393623 we firmly oppose any words or acts which interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
2393624 when he scored 25 goals the season before no one thought he could do better than that but i felt he could
2393625 i expected him to improve just as i expect him to improve next season
2393626 of course we are at a different level twenty five goals against 42 is totally different
2393627 he alonso was playing well that was positive for us
2393628 wildly popular iron man trailer to be adapted into full length film
2393629 i think it was a very good game against a good team
2393630 you could see they were pretty sharp comfortable on the ball and played well on the counter attack we had two or three really good chances to score and win the game so overall it was very positive particularly as we had a lot of young players in the side

2393634 we need at least 50 years of observation to make such claim
2393635 ma questo che il mondo di oggi si aspetta da una coppia che crei vite al solo scopo di far vivere loro una vita triste infelicit anche allinterno del matrimonio dileggio e scherno da parte di chiunque dotato di un po di razionalit mista a tentativi di approfittare della donna da parte di chi di razionalit ne ha poca
2393636 no io non faro mai quella fine la mia famiglia sara solida al riparo da questo orrore
2393637 now that was a real nail biter the court designed by the white house and its congressional enablers to guarantee convictions of high profile detainees in guant namo bay cuba using evidence obtained by torture and secret evidence as desired has held its first trial it produced a guilty verdict
2393638 ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country
2393639 opm can run all the advertisements in the world but if your family or neighbor knows youre doing public service and youre not proud of it then why should they care
2393640 we have these four year cycles in government and you could very easily take things back to the ground level again
2393641 instead of going back build on that and keep going we have great career people at every agency and thats the real heartbeat of public service
2393642 although ive often said we need to do more with less there comes a time when our priorities must be reset
2393643 we should consider ourselves lucky that the men and women of the state department have answered the call to serve these dedicated public servants must no longer be taken for granted
2393644 weve had to open missions in asia in central europe in newly independent states the fact that india china mexico are becoming economic success stories and their people want to travel is putting increased burdens on our consular staff we have terrible challenges with narcotics terrible challenges with security we think this 1 500 is just an initial step in what we will need to have a more robust state department and usaid u s agency for international development
2393645 imagine if only 20 percent of army officers had been trained to fire a weapon
2393646 the world is changing rapidly and i fear that todays foreign service does not have to a sufficient degree the knowledge skills abilities and outlooks that taken together as a package should make career diplomats uniquely able to conduct 21st century diplomacy
2393647 support the recruiting assessing hiring paying and promoting of all tsa employees
2393648 at present i fail to understand how this contract will benefit the transportation security officer workforce and what the contract will actually require the vendor to do to alleviate the known problems at tsa
2393649 another step down the wrong path by a troubled agency
2393650 the profit lockheed martin will make from a 1 2 billion deal could be used to increase staffing and reduce congestion at our nations airports
2393651 is that not a much better use of taxpayers money
2393652 allow the tsa to have the right staff at the right time and at the right place to support its critical mission of keeping our nation safe and secure
2393653 we had an idea tonight of what we can get at twente
2393654 in a weeks time we play a big part of the season which is the champions league
2393655 we want to be there so we know we have to be ready and opponents like this ajax are the sort of opponents we will face
2393656 on the left side you can expect mannini who is crucial to our project
2393657 even though there are plenty of rumours we are looking to complete the squad in that department
2393658 we have a loyalty and duty to our players to enhance their values but we must also stay loyal to what society expects in the transfer market and that should be clear to all our players
2393659 i must be touching you at all times and i am not to speak to any other person for any reason unless you introduce me directly
2393660 it is going to be awesome to go out and just focus only on you and i love you
2393661 it isnt easy to play a team that will begin their championship on saturday they were ahead in their preparation
2393662 i was curious to see how my team would react physically and mentally i saw the right spirit i am sorry for the result but it was right to play our younger players who have been working very well
2393663 maybe we will try to sign one more player if we can i dont know when
2393664 depois do twitter baleiar segui um perfil e come ei e estou adorando twittar j que agora eu sou um tweets
2393665 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views respected and i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified because i know from just what im hearing that there is just this incredible pent up desire
2393666 and i think people want to feel like okay its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind senator obama no decisions have been made
2393667 i could be wrong but the best way i think is to have a strategy where my delegates feel that they have a role and that their legitimacy has been validated
2393668 i have an incredible amount of vintage that ive collected over the years my style is very americana i gravitate to pieces that are american by nature either western or depression era i do almost everything in jeans except sleep denim has become so high priced as of late my friends back home dont want to spend 250 for a pair of jeans i want them to be able to walk into a medium priced store and be able to afford a cool pair of jeans for less than 100 bucks
2393669 i hope at least a small part of columbia now knows that nordic men can also dance salsa
2393670 overall we played really well we had some execution problems but theyre pitching well so its not easy wasnt easy for them either
2393671 i had too much pine tar i didnt even realize it happened
2393672 lilly has kind of a pause and i turned when he got to the top of his leg kick
2393673 i didnt realize he had such a long pause when i turned he threw it right at my knees there was nothing i could do i probably could have waited a little longer but normally when a guys knee is all the way up usually hes coming home
2393674 but he kept coming in and coming in so i knew it would probably be a close play it took a good throw to get me out a lot of times you go in there hoping theres part of the plate open soto did a good job of blocking the plate it was just a good play by them
2393675 i wish i could have made one more pitch to jimmy that last at bat
2393676 it kind of leaves a sour taste in my mouth
2393677 runs are hard to come by it was an aggressive play if the guy had gone the same time as his first two pitches he would have stolen it without a throw
2393678 it is because of the faggots that this generation is so screwed up all these people decide they are gay and wind up leading our youths in churches and turn out to be pedophiles
2393679 it is better that you have a millstone tied around your neck and you be cast into the ocean than for you to hurt one of my children

2393682 meeting john edwards was interesting he was very real and authentic he was inspirational to me one of the great things about john edwards is that he is so open and willing to try new things and do things in new ways
2393683 thats crazy talk no one can know that no one
2393684 one thing about paris hilton and her energy policy is that she brings energy to about whatever she does and she said that she was hot that
2393685 i guarantee old or not with paris hilton talking about energy them fellas will be listening probably watching too
2393686 we d bypass them evan williams fellas who tried to insert themselves into the political process and influence the voters of kentucky that re doing here we re trying to get the energy right view story
2393687 i said i want you to take me on a date
2393688 well here let me give you my number and if you still want to go on a date tomorrow give me a call
2393689 no i dont get boys numbers you can take my number and when you are ready to take me out give me a call
2393690 i was actually wondering if i could ask you a question
2393691 actually i was wondering if you would have a threesome with me and my husband hes right over there hes really cute if you want to take a look and we are really interested in you coming home with us
2393692 well we are just really attracted to you and so we were hoping
2393693 honey why would you ever want to share your husband with another girl
2393694 well i am very flattered but im not really into things like that thank you so much though
2393695 i said i want you to take me on a date
2393696 well here let me give you my number and if you still want to go on a date tomorrow give me a call
2393697 no i dont get boys numbers you can take my number and when you are ready to take me out give me a call
2393698 i was actually wondering if i could ask you a question
2393699 actually i was wondering if you would have a threesome with me and my husband hes right over there hes really cute if you want to take a look and we are really interested in you coming home with us
2393700 well we are just really attracted to you and so we were hoping
2393701 honey why would you ever want to share your husband with another girl
2393702 well i am very flattered but im not really into things like that thank you so much though
2393703 you know what i was an asshole when i was using and i am really sorry for the things i did
2393704 he who forgiveth and is reconciled unto his enemy shall receive his reward from god for he loveth not the unjust doers
2393705 sincere forgiveness isnt colored with expectation that the other person apologize or change dont worry whether or not they finally understand you love them and release them life feeds back truth to people in its own way and time
2393706 the past our cradle not our prison there is danger as well as appeal in its glamour the past is for inspiration not imitation for continuation not repetition
2393707 i can forgive but i cannot forget is only another way of saying i will not forgive forgiveness ought to be like a cancelled note torn in two and burned up so that it never can be shown against one
2393708 the remarkable thing is that we really love our neighbor as ourselves we do unto others as we do unto ourselves we hate others when we hate ourselves we are tolerant toward others when we tolerate ourselves we forgive others when we forgive ourselves we are prone to sacrifice others when we are ready to sacrifice ourselves
2393709 when you forgive you in no way change the past but you sure do change the future
2393710 forgiveness is the fragrance the violet sheds on the heel that has crushed it
2393711 anger makes you smaller while forgiveness forces you to grow beyond what you were
2393712 if you havent forgiven yourself something how can you forgive others
2393713 no i was kind of in the hospital all last night
2393714 im fine it was my friend he was having seizures
2393715 im glad to see we are inching our way forward for our veterans from rural areas
2393716 our executive council weighed in pretty strongly against the idea of life cycle funds as the default option
2393717 they thought it was an important step to authorize the government to lower an employees salary by deducting contributions and to go further and expose them to the stock market
2393718 contrary to what you might think lets grab some power here we think its a big mistake
2393719 i think the way it was set up was to make this thing apolitical
2393720 all due respect to the board members were dead set against this
2393721 we think this could create a situation where this plan could spin off in a direction that no one intended theres a theory to this plan that its broad based low cost index funds it does open up the idea that every single industry in the country that has an index fund could add it to the tsp
2393722 during the three year tenure of linda springer as director of the office of personnel management there were a number of issues on which we disagreed but we were always able to maintain a professional working relationship
2393723 nteu will make every effort to work cooperatively with the acting director in the coming months
2393724 i sound more like a union leader than i do management on this issue
2393725 when director springer took the job at opm she was unfortunately thrust into the middle of bush administration policy objectives that were openly hostile toward our nations civil servants
2393726 while ifpte continues to respect and thank director springer for her service to the country we will nonetheless continue to bring transparency to capitol hill with respect to opm policies such as nsps
2393727 with the departure of the current chair an opportunity now exists at the flra to put in place new leadership that is experienced in labor relations understands and respects the roles and contributions of federal employees and is willing to deal fairly with federal employee issues
2393728 as i bless the world around me i am blessed in return
2393729 the easiest way to bless something is to simply give god thanks

2393738 in juan lunas revolver luisa igloria establishes herself as a singular and revelatory voice in american poetry here she explores the dichotomy of filipino interwoven yet hermetically singular acquisitive yet inventive docile yet amok her engrossing poems hide behind their gorgeous scrims a bristling wall of spears
2393739 when i read a luisa igloria poem a bright enchanted light falls over my being juan lunas revolver is iglorias best work to date these poems never let us forget they are wrought from an immigrants love for family country and the history of the reinvented self
2393740 what a world to have lived in to have arrived in luisa igloria writes early on in this brilliant collection that explores colonization and cultural displacement and how the artist must live in the aftermath of both even when she writes about places many miles away igloria constructs a luminous portrait of what is utterly human and ultimately familiar these poems reveal a poet devoted to the truth of her craft
2393741 in sure and compelling measures with richly textured turns and attending to the mystery of matter luisa iglorias poems offer a powerfully tangible world and a world within and a world beyond

2393744 we are very disappointed that iran has yet again failed to give javier solana a clear answer to the generous incentives package
2393745 we agreed that we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran
2393746 we have some negotiating opportunities and rather than focus almost entirely on sanctions we should focus on what those opportunities should be
2393747 the us government unwarrantedly insists on its unacceptable behaviour in scapegoating others including iran for its own wrong policies in iraq in order to distract attention from the sources of us failures in that country

2393751 i cant believe they based a two level store on a candy
2393752 its not a two level store based on a candy its a three level store based on a candy
2393753 i spent a lot of time in the studio i spent a lot of time coming up with how to sing the songs basically the studio is like my second home ive spent a lot of time in the studio trying to get this album done i didnt want to rush things i wanted things to be perfect
2393754 also ive been trying to come up with the steps for the dance tracks were doing and the image its all part of it
2393755 the first and second albums were more tailored to the hong kong masses
2393756 but now the songs on my latest album are more in a direction i want
2393757 one of the reasons is i now have more artistic input and i get to give my opinions and ideas to my producers and my boss leon lai the legendary cantopop singer the second reason is that leon has been away he had to do three films he usually makes the decisions and decides the direction for my albums so he has to be here so we can have the meetings and discuss the album
2393758 were both such different people and we both have different talents she is just amazing at singing ballads and singing slow love songs thats why the masses are in favour of her they can sing along to her songs
2393759 i really wish that hong kong music would just change that everyone would just take a chance and buy an album that is different from what theyre used to i really hope more people would have an open mind
2393760 i hope that i can be able to change their minds when they hear a song from my latest album on the radio or somewhere
2393761 the weird thing is when growing up we liked the same music we have a lot of music at home and have everything from ska punk to black metal to acid jazz music that i would not be able to make right now my sister and i have the same music tastes because were very open to everything
2393762 when we first started it was really bad we played the seediest clubs and we got the lowest pay cheques
2393763 slowly we started getting invited to play at some really cool jazzy places and the pay actually got better
2393764 the thing i liked about it was working with a lot of musicians being able to perform so freely and being able to do all the music that we liked no rules we could sing whatever we wanted
2393765 the bad side of it was having to take requests they would ask for the cheesiest songs
2393766 it really helped me to gain a lot of experience for when i had to come out in front of large audiences of people who actually like my music it taught me not to have stage fright when i saw other newcomers they looked so nervous and scared me i was just excited to get out there
2393767 it wasnt for two year after that that i got signed
2393768 my sister got signed while i was backpacking with 12 friends around asia
2393769 i told my sister about this and she told her manager amusic thought that if i signed to a rival company then there would be too much comparison and rivalry so amusic asked to see me and thats when i got signed
2393770 janice had already cornered the pop market but anyway i wanted to do funkier stuff they knew that that was what i wanted to do right off the bat
2393771 i really like the korean singer se7en hes my inspiration ever since i was 17 years old ive liked him i first noticed him when he first came out with his first album one look at him and i knew he was going to be big his singing and dancing skills are just amazing and hes made it in the states he even made it there before rain
2393772 there was talk in the press about making us a band but there was never talk of that in our company they always thought that to have solo careers for us was the right way to go because theres already a group named twins its been done before and theres also 2r
2393773 i was thinking more ashlee and jessica simpson with me being ashlee and janice being jessica because jessica sings more ballady songs and ashlee is more pop rock and dance
2393774 i am a very social and active person i think my sister is more of a homebody id rather be out bungee jumping or sky diving

2393803 videogames must be capable of rethinking their narration formats and genres they have to be capable of offering alternatives to established genres in the same way as american tv series have done by asserting themselves as an efficient counterweight to the movie industry by taking the economic model of the series with short formats and attractive subjects available at definite dates and times we are aiming at all those who have turned their backs on playing videogames due to lack of time or boredom

2393807 when one day cricket became big in india i had said it was like fast food buying a burger from outside when no one is prepared to cook at home the staple home food will remain as the most important meal but occasionally one would go out to buy a burger and that is the difference between test and one day cricket

2393861 keprihatinan itu kita tuangkan dalam bentuk pelatihan kepada sejumlah anak jalanan pelatihan lebih ditekankan kepada pengembangan diri dan mengubah perilaku mereka
2393862 kita juga mengajarkan mereka untuk berjiwa entrepreneur kita ajarkan kepada mereka cara berdagang yang benar kita peduli dengan keberadaan mereka
2393863 kekerasan terhadap mereka harus kita cegah dan harus ditindak pelakunya

2393917 proclaimed that only the toiling masses of a nation could legitimately exercise the right to self determination the claims of the national bourgeoisie must be disregarded
2393918 the soviet bureaucracy in the ukraine chiefly composed of russians was openly hostile to ukrainian culture and ideas

2393954 the tour of india is certainly the most important assignment for our team and is perhaps even more important than the world cup
2393955 i expect that all the players including shoaib akhtar would be at their best behaviour and give their hundred percent on the tour because we have to deliver good results against india
2393956 i hope that shoaib will be a changed man on the tour of india
2393957 it is his last chance and we all hope that this time he would not waste it
2393958 he also has a point to prove and should give his best to silence his critics who believe he is spent force
2393959 im sure shoaib and all the other experienced boys will fulfill their responsibility as senior players and act as a positive force to lift the morale of the national team
2393960 our team will play positive and attacking cricket in india and we will win

2393972 children do not learn by themselves how to distinguish right from wrong
2393973 parents also should teach their children early in life the glorious concept and fact that they are spirit children of god and choosing to follow the teachings of jesus christ is the only way to enjoy success and happiness here and eternal life hereafter they must be taught that satan is real and that he will use all agencies at his disposal to tempt them to do wrong to lead them astray make them his captives and keep them from the supreme happiness and exaltation they could otherwise enjoy
2393974 for the first part of childhood the most important task for children is obedience learning to follow parental advice very strictly however as children grow older they gradually must pay more attention to the task of learning to act independently in the beginning parents personally show three year old children exactly when and where to cross the street such guidance at age fourteen is seldom appropriate in fact if adolescents do not eventually pay more attention to this second task they become in a real sense crippled continually dependent on parents to make their decisions
2393975 we try to guide our children toward self respect and mostly leave it up to them to judge themselves
2393976 i remember once how we asked our son after a transgression to set his own punishment he decided that he should not be allowed to watch television for one month that seemed to us to be considerably too severe but how happy we were to hear from his grandmother that while visiting her he had insisted she was wrong to encourage him to watch a certain television program even though his parents would never know i dont think there can be a greater joy for parents than to see a child handle himself well in a difficult situation

2393994 the all absorbing topic of daily conversation at the present time is of course the
2393995 i have several distinct ideas regarding the subjugation of the submarine
2393996 many years ago while serving in the capacity of chief electrician for an electric plant situated on the river seine in france i had occasion to require for certain testing purposes an extremely sensitive galvanometer
2393997 it became a fact that the small iron hull steam mail packets ships plying up and down the river seine at a distance of 3 miles would distinctly affect the galvanometer
2393998 i believe the magnetic method of locating or indicating the presence of an iron or steel mass might prove very practical in locating a hidden submarine
2393999 however a means would soon be found of nullifying this magnetic detector of the submerged undersea war craft they might make the u boat hulls of some non magnetic metal such as copper brass or aluminum it is a good rule to always keep in mind that for practically every good invention of such a kind as this there has always been invented an opposite and equally efficient counteracting invention
2394000 how about this new electric ray method of locating submarines
2394001 now suppose that we erect on a vessel a large rectangular helice or inductance coil of insulated wire actual experiments in my laboratory at houston street new york city have proven that the presence of a local iron mass such as the ships hull would not interfere with the action of this device to this coil of wire measuring perhaps 400 feet in length by 70 feet in width the breadth of the ship we connect a source of extremely high frequency and very powerful oscillating current by this means there are radiated powerful oscillating electro static currents which as i have found by actual experiment in my colorado tests some years ago will first affect a metallic body such as a submarine hull even though made of brass or any other metal and in turn cause that mass to react inductively on the exciting coil on the ship to locate an iron mass it is not necessary to excite the coil with a high frequency current the critical balance of the coil will be affected simply by the presence of the magnetic body to be able to accurately determine the direction and range of the enemy submarine four exciting inductances should be used with a single inductance however it would be possible to determine the location of a submarine by running the ship first in one direction and then in another and noting whether the reactance effect caused by the presence of the submarine hull increased or decreased the radiating inductance must be very sharply attuned to the measuring apparatus installed on the ship when no trouble will be found in detecting the presence of such a large metallic mass as a submarine even at a distance of 5 to 6 miles of this i feel confident from my past experiments in the realm of ultra high frequency currents and potentials
2394002 what particular experiments do you have in mind dr tesla
2394003 the ulivi ray really was transplanted from this country to italy
2394004 it was simply an adaptation of my ultra powerful high frequency phenomena as carried out in colorado and cited previously

2394009 he needs nine wickets to pass warneys world record and i want to make it pretty clear that it would be nice if he left australia not getting those nine wickets
2394010 if thats the case then weve done a pretty good job hes also made it pretty clear over the years that he feels australian batsmen play him better than any other team in the world in saying that and in our conditions hopefully we can keep him under wraps
2394011 it never occurred to us that the doors would be locked at midnight the late night festival was a first for perth and it was fabulous
2394012 i realise now that theres a notice stating the opening hours so it was our fault but maybe if this is to be repeated and i certainly hope it is there should be a special and bigger notice warning of the midnight curfew
2394013 we werent the only ones caught out there were a few people at the car park when it opened again at 7am i just hope they werent from much further afield
2394014 the southern fried brochure and our main brochure has the kinnoull street opening hours and clearly states the car park closes at midnight
2394015 we were delighted that so many people came from far and wide to attend a weekend of music the like of which perth has never seen before
2394016 we have had a wonderful response from those who attended the southern fried festival and hope the pa reader who had a problem with the car park was still able to enjoy the weekend
2394017 i have spoken with our team at the multi storey car park in kinnoull street the horsecross did not request any extension to the parking arrangements and hours so our operating hours were as normal
2394018 we do have signage throughout the premises including signs which display our operating hours at either side of each exit

2394028 small business owners in the elder care and senior service market need an affordable way to promote themselves through video we have created an opportunity for anyone in this market to have their own customized 30 second tv spot to use as television advertising and on their websites blogs and video podcasts
2394029 many small business owners prefer to use these spots for websites and video blogs they can use the broadcast ready commercial on television but we do not require them to purchase media time through us that is an additional expense that many cant afford right now especially in an election year

2394040 if congress determines that additional resources above the presidents request are needed congress must provide reductions in other appropriations bills to offset this increase and meet the presidents topline discretionary spending cap of 991 6 billion
2394041 if congress does not offset this increase with spending reductions in other bills the president will veto any of the other bills that exceed his request until congress demonstrates a path to reach the presidents top line

2394061 we have been on this vibe for quite i while i must confess after a careful review of 2006 we knew it had become imperative to downsize but these are briefs in which time effort and resources have been invested so its never really that easy to discontinue our response was to put a cap to the number of artistes on the line up so we didnt more like couldnt sign on anybody else it was tough considering that it kept out solid new prospects we admired but we stuck to it now its january 2008 and we have achieved a massive scale down from 16 to 8 acts our ideal number is actually 6 so well still be on the look out to see if there could be a possibility of further to re arrange the set up
2394062 in 2007 we reconnected with t w o and took on the briefs of paul play and ill bliss these moves werent so scary for two reasons
2394063 people find it hard to believe it when we announce we have parted ways without rancour and it is typical of human beings
2394064 were too classy for this hustle even if i say so myself
2394065 music is an emotional hustle and a lot of artistes are not as enlightened as they ought to be add a sprinkling of the high of sudden success or frustration of persistent failure to hit the mark and you have a super volatile mix management and label personnel arent always angels either so from way back when these disagreements have been an integral part of the business the jackson 5 left motown after earning success under its wings michael jackson even later fired his dad as manager these things always happen i dont want to hold brief for other management personnel or labels but i think the average nigerian artiste needs to be better enlightened more professional and more realistic a little gratitude and sense of loyalty wouldnt hurt either when people put their time and hard earned money into helping you build or sustain a career a little consideration for someone other than you is not a sign of weakness or stupidity time however is the ultimate judge and the results are always glaring we have our challenges but we do our thing effective now muzik style and when all is said and done the results show how well weve performed or otherwise from management perspective take a critical look at the careers of most of our former clients post now muzik and youll be able to do a proper appraisal of our contribution 2face 2 shotz dlyte eedris abdulkareem african china rocsyde etc their time at now muzik has certainly not been the lowest of their careers in about a year we would be able to assess the situation with rugged free fd niyola and the others who we recently released the guys who are still around obviously recognize that recording and performing though vital arent all there is to the business we are making progress because they do their job and someone now muzik does its our job is not as glamourous as theirs but believe me its just as tricky strenuous and important to the bottom line thats why we always choose to see it as a partnership
2394066 hopefully not strictly it should be a guy we havent been that lucky with females even when we obviously commit more effort time and money we still come out disappointed funke niyola dlyte muma gee maideena this brand has not been lucky with female acts and its quite a pity because personally ive always had a better relationship with females a greater percentage of my most reliable loyal steadfast and supportive friends and favourite people are females isnt it ironic
2394067 its going to be more intense and considerably more broad based now muzik management will receive a shot in the arm now muzik events and promotions will be consolidating on the achievements of last year and this is the year i get my media hustle on in full blast
2394068 intended no just to give modern english equivalents but to gloss the components of words and to indicate etymological connections in compounded words for example very often an effort is made first to gloss the elements literally or to point to a modern reflex and only after to suggest a more precise semantic equivalent
2394069 deseamos que den la imagen de espa a que todos queremos que den
2394070 i havent arranged it yet but obviously i want to sit down with marian while im over there
2394071 i just want to make sure were on the same page
2394072 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2394073 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2394074 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2394075 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2394076 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2394077 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2394078 used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it
2394079 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2394080 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2394081 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen

2394090 we are very grateful to the campbell family at weem farm who have offered this space and we are looking forward to the challenge of setting up the show and games in this spectacular setting
2394091 we are indebted to willie grieve and his team for the work they are doing we are also very appreciative of the continuing support of barhaul dewars world of whisky and a new sponsor this year laing orourke the company involved in the construction of the new school campus
2394092 the society was very saddened by the recent and untimely death of brian smith our immediate past chairman who for many years had convened the horse and pony section with great efficiency and humour
2394093 brian will be sadly missed by us all and the show wont be the same
2394094 hrmm that ponzi scheme thing they have going on over there seems to be working pretty well how can i do that for my campaign and not break the law
2394095 if you dont find god in the next person you meet it is a waste of time looking for him further
2394096 it is our duty as men and women to behave as though limits to our ability do not exist we are co creators of the universe
2394097 whatever you can do or dream you can begin it boldness has genius power and magic in it begin it now
2394098 the only people who get anywhere interesting are the people who get lost
2394099 and the day came when it was more painful to remain tight in a bud than the risk it took to blossom
2394100 education is a better safeguard of liberty than a standing army
2394101 watch your thoughts they become words watch your words they become actions watch your actions they become habits watch your habits they become character watch your character it becomes your destiny
2394102 we all know that a rocket burns most of its fuel during the first few moments of flight as it overcomes inertia and the gravitational pull of the earth thats what its like for us as we launch our dreams into physical reality
2394103 at the critical juncture in all human relationships there is only one question what would love do now
2394104 success in life is a matter not so much of talent or opportunity as of concentration and perseverance
2394105 the road to success is not to be run upon by seven leagued boots step by step little by little bit by bit that is the way to wealth that is the way to wisdom that is the way to glory pounds are the sons not of pounds but of pence
2394106 in the private sanctuary of ones own conscience lies that spirit that determination to cast off the old person and to measure up to the stature of true potential
2394107 it is never too late to be what you might have been
2394108 you are here to enrich the world and you impoverish yourself if you forget that errand
2394109 it had long since come to my attention that people of accomplishment rarely sat back and let things happen to them they went out and happened to things
2394110 wherever you are is always the right place there is never a need to fix anything to hitch up the bootstraps of the soul and start at some higher place start right where you are
2394111 everything you need you already have you are complete right now you are a whole total person not an apprentice person on the way to someplace else
2394112 who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented and fabulous
2394113 in my experience it is the biggest piece of congestion in the stewartry
2394114 the council have expressed a willingness within the confines of the budget to look at the issue and the first stage is assessing the traffic volumes
2394115 i said to them there was no point in it being done during the summer so it will take place once school resumes
2394116 we are currently investigating traffic issues relating to this junction a survey of traffic movements at this junction will be carried out during the school term when is when peaks of traffic occur
2394117 i have had complaints from so many people some spending 15 minutes every day waiting to clear the junction traffic problems in the area escalate during the school term and the congestion puts drivers and schoolchildren at risk
2394118 blessed are the poor in spirit because theirs is the reign of the heavens ts
2394119 blessed are those who mourn because they shall be comforted ts
2394120 blessed are the meek because they shall inherit the earth ts
2394121 blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness because they shall be filled ts
2394122 blessed are the compassionate because they shall obtain compassion ts
2394123 blessed are the clean in heart because they shall see elohim ts
2394124 blessed are the peacemakers because they shall be called sons of elohim ts
2394125 blessed are those persecuted for righteousness sake because theirs is the reign of the heavens ts
2394126 blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you and falsely say every wicked word against you for my sake ts
2394127 rejoice and be glad because your reward in the heavens is great for in this way they persecuted the prophets who were before you ts
2394128 you are the salt of the earth but if the salt becomes tasteless how shall it be seasoned for it is no longer of any use but to be thrown out and to be trodden down by men ts
2394129 you are the light of the world it is impossible for a city to be hidden on a mountain ts
2394130 nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket but on a lampstand and it shines to all those in the house ts
2394131 let your light so shine before men so that they see your good works and praise your father who is in the heavens ts
2394132 do not think that i came to destroy the torah or the prophets i did not come to destroy but to complete ts
2394133 for truly i say to you till the heaven and the earth pass away one jot or one tittle shall by no means pass from the torah till all be done ts
2394134 whoever then breaks one of the least of these commands and teaches men so shall be called least in the reign of the heavens but whoever does and teaches them he shall be called great in the reign of the heavens ts
2394135 for i say to you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and pharisees you shall by no means enter in to the reign of the heavens ts
2394136 you heard that it was said to those of old you shall not murder and whoever murders shall be liable to judgment ts
2394137 but i say to you that whoever is wroth with his brother without a cause shall be liable to judgment and whoever says to his brother raka shall be liable to the sanhedrin but whoever says you fool shall be liable to fire of gehenna ts
2394138 if then you bring your gift to the altar and there remember that your brother holds whatever against you ts
2394139 be well minded with your opponent promptly while you are on the way with him lest your opponent deliver you to the judge and the judge to the officer and you be thrown into prison ts
2394140 truly i say to you you shall by no means get out of there till you have paid the last penny ts
2394141 you heard that it was said to those of old you shall not commit adultery ts
2394142 but i say to you that everyone looking at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart ts
2394143 and if your right eye causes you to stumble pluck it out and throw it away from you for it is better for you that one of your members perish than for your entire body to be thrown into gehenna ts
2394144 and if your right hand causes you to stumble cut it off and throw it away from you for it is better for you that one of your members perish than for your entire body to be thrown into gehenna ts
2394145 and it has been said whoever puts away his wife let him give her a certificate of divorce ts
2394146 but i say to you that whoever puts away his wife except for the matter of whoring makes her commit adultery and whoever marries a woman who has been put away commits adultery ts
2394147 again you heard that it was said to those of old you shall not swear falsely but shall perform your oaths to this translation uses the four hebrew letters that represent the name of jehovah ts
2394148 but i say to you do not swear at all neither by the heaven because it is elohims throne ts
2394149 but let your word yea be yea and your no be no and what goes beyond these is from the wicked one ts
2394150 you heard that it was said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth ts
2394151 and he who wishes to sue you and take away your inner garment let him have your outer garment as well ts
2394152 and whoever compels you to go one mile go with him two ts
2394153 give to him who asks of you and from him who wishes to borrow from you do not turn away ts
2394154 you heard that it was said you shall love your neighbour and hate your enemy ts
2394155 but i say to you love your enemies bless those cursing you do good to those hating you and pray for those insulting you and persecuting you ts
2394156 for if you love those loving you what reward have you are the tax collectors not doing the same too ts
2394157 and if you greet your brothers only what do you do more
2394158 therefore be perfect as your father in the heavens is perfect ts
2394159 that is it wrong for anyone to concentrate his attention on the speck in his brothers eye and while thus occupied to ignore the beam in his own eye
2394160 the lord is here condemning the spirit of censoriousness judging harshly self righteously without mercy without love as also the parallel passage lk 6 36 37 clearly indicates
2394161 for with what judgment you judge you will be judged
2394162 with the same measure you use it will be measured back to you
2394163 self righteous hypocritical judging which is false and calls down gods judgment on itself
2394164 he who has displayed so great goodness as to form the body and breathe into it the breath of life will surely follow up the blessing and confer the smaller favor of providing that the body be clothed and that life 2 look at the birds of the air are you not more valuable than behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them are ye not much better than they
2394165 little wherefore if god so clothe the grass of the field which to day is and to morrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you o ye of little faith
2394166 dont worry seek gods will first and you will be happy
2394167 we had the marquees up by tuesday and all the organising has been going very well
2394168 there are good entries for the competitions numbers are a little up in both horses and sheep cattle are down a little this is a general phenomenon at a number of shows this year but not a significant drop weve strong classes in the holstein and dairy sections
2394169 the food town initiative has a marquee and tom kirkpatrick of kirkpatricks in kirkcudbright will be doing cookery demonstrations
2394170 there are lots of food stalls the majority of which are selling local produce
2394171 dont worry they are only passing clouds it wont rain everything will be perfect
2394172 were helpless now the fire is all around us just sit down where you are and chant sai ram
2394173 give russia the message that invading the territory of a sovereign state and bombing its territory is unacceptable in the 21st century
2394174 the latest tragic developments should become the last step toward the recognition of south ossetias independence
2394175 i am sure that the independence of south ossetia will be recognized in the near future
2394176 its a massive loss to us but these things happen in football sometimes youve got a good player and when he thinks he can go to a higher level its not very nice if you dont let him go
2394177 well be looking to get someone in now and were back to looking in the transfer market to see whose available ive made a few calls but ive had no luck yet
2394178 he says hes finding the travelling a problem so well see if anybody enquires about him
2394179 he scored 37 goals for us last year so id imagine therell be a couple of teams interested in him
2394180 well maybe be able to do a player swap players like that give you a bit of bargaining power when you approach other clubs about players
2394181 we didnt have a great end to last season but he still scored 37 goals and im quite sure he could score a few goals for any other team
2394182 anything we get out of the game will be a major bonus theres going to be at least six sfl boys in the team but its the same for every team now itll be the case throughout the season and if everybodys experiencing the same thing its not so unfair
2394183 the boysll be looking forward to the challenge and i think the team annan are putting together must be title favourites along with stranraer
2394184 some of the players annan have got are sfl quality its no different to stranraer last year or queen of the south a couple of years ago itll be a strong test for the boys but well give it our best shot
2394185 it was a good first half performance but it was terrible in the second half we played some good football in the first half but the second half was very flat
2394186 over the piece it was a good three points the first game of the season was a nightmare but on saturday we won quite easily
2394187 missy you are better than this what are you doing
2394188 missy someday you will meet someone and realize why this heartache was worth it
2394189 missy you are better than this what are you doing
2394190 missy someday you will meet someone and realize why this heartache was worth it
2394191 moveon org announced thursday it was launching radio ads targeting republicans for organizing
2394192 the united states urged russia on friday to halt aircraft and missile attacks in georgias breakaway region of south ossetia and withdraw its combat forces from georgian territory as the situation in the former soviet state verged on full scale war secretary of state
2394193 corp said friday that global sales at restaurants open at least 13 months rose 8 percent in july as the key u s market posted its largest gain
2394194 this is an ideal opportunity for residents to come along and put their questions to a top table of representatives from perth and kinross council and tayside police
2394195 this council is committed to building safe and secure communities community wardens play an important role in this as they are already demonstrating in letham and hillyland
2394196 we want to build on this success so i am delighted that the scheme is being expanded into rattray
2394197 this is another important step in the work we are undertaking with our partners to promote community safety in perth and kinross
2394198 any offences committed on the vessel will be thoroughly investigated and anyone convicted can expect to be severely dealt with by the courts
2394199 mention the special relationship to americans and they say yes its a really special relationship
2394200 if we go up with the 11 weve got fit ill be quite happy as i believe thats the strongest were going to get now
2394201 theres not a lot of strength in depth and we need to add to it somewhere along the line if ross kerrs fit well take 12 up and ive no doubt they can compete quite comfortably
2394202 weve got a couple of lads from the south that could come in and boost us up and weve still got martin cunliffe on the books were still looking to sign a couple of targets and im still hoping to bring one or two in
2394203 i was disappointed with the start we made on saturday i think everything was too easy for us in the first five or ten minutes possession wise and the players got a bit complacent and lost two stupid goals from the only two balls into our box
2394204 for some strange reason they got a bit anxious in the final third they settled in the second half and it was a good response from them
2394205 were looking to build on last year youre always looking to progress and if theres no progression its time for me to move aside
2394206 id like to finish higher up the table and hopefully achieve the same run in the scottish cup as we did last year the key to thatll be keeping everybody fit when everybodys fit well be as good as there is
2394207 i still believe spartans will be that bit ahead of everybody with the signings theyve made
2394208 i think theyll be a team looking to compete in the top half of the league it turned into two leagues last year from annan up with ourselves in that
2394209 the top half teams did stretch away from the bottom half i think thatll happen again this year and i think heriot watt will be in that group
2394210 at the bottom of each page to access them all
2394211 and if he were those people would be voting for someone else now
2394212 how wonderful it would be if thousands of such booklets could be made available
2394213 well maybe youd like to go to san francisco about 40 miles
2394214 were creating chances and were good going forward its just the defensive side of things we need to sort out
2394215 were just conceding silly goals which we dont normally do but were going to try to get that sorted out its been a wee bit of a concern
2394216 attackings not a problem the strikers are getting the goals theyre all trying to stake a claim in the team
2394217 it makes it harder for decisions when it comes to the lineup on a saturday but thats what you want
2394218 shaun played at the back alongside jimmy fingland and did well keiran came on in the second half and did well on the right hand side
2394219 there are certain games where we can play them and that was the ideal game
2394220 the boys will get games now and again and well play them when we can its a big step from lochar youths to the south
2394221 unfortunately i got some traffic before my last stop which allowed nick heidfeld to pass me otherwise i couldnt do anymore today the car has a lot of oversteer and rear sliding now well just focus on the next race and see that we can do there
2394222 mas mbok ditulis itu kasus istri dokter yang sudah membunuh pembantunya sebanyak dua kali lalu beritanya menghilang begitu saja nanti kalau dia membunuh pembantu yang ketiga keempat apa akan kita biarkan begitu saja
2394223 yang saya takutkan sekarang kan media gencar mengekspos soal pembunuhan yang dilakukan riyan jangan jangan dengan kekuatan uang diam diam sang pembunuh lolos lagi lalu membunuh lagi beberapa tahun kemudian

2394225 you must be a faerie man if you live with gerry
2394226 earlier in the day a number of pros offered up their opinions on what they hoped to draft for the final four rounds of day 1 play and the verdict seemed unanimous monocolor strategies preferably white ones were in
2394227 die meisten hier im sch nen bayern denken aber automatisch an meine liste wenn sie survival h ren weil andere piloten meistens lieber in der anonymen masse untergehen anstatt zu zeigen was das deck wirklich kann
2394228 wenn man sich richtig entscheidet gewinnt man mit aktiven survival fast immer kommen wir zu dem unsch nen teil man hat kein survival das deckprinzip ist dann solange zu berleben to survive bis man das survival hat oder ber witness und therapy soviel kartenvorteil erzeugt hat dass man auch ohne gewinnt das klingt einfacher als es in wirklichkeit ist
2394229 3 eternal witness kein kommentar f r die vier ist kein platz und man braucht sie selten viermal
2394230 enlightened tutor ich war noch nie ein freund von carddisadvantage man kann die karte schon spielen wenn dann allerdings euer enchantment gecountert wird und ihr mit leerer hand dasitzt m sst ihr nicht das whinen anfangen dass ihr so schlecht zieht
2394231 when you are drafting shadowmoor shadowmoor eventide there are significantly more incentives to be mono colored going into the third pack than there are to be enemy colored
2394232 my point is if you have a very good definite reason to be playing something then that will often be better than a potential reason to be doing something
2394233 klammert euch beim draften nicht krampfhaft an irgendwelche archetypen sondern macht das beste aus dem was ihr in den boostern tats chlich vorfindet
2394234 if you only have an ok reason to be limiting your options then you are likely dooming your deck to mediocrity
2394235 just after the draw was made it was pandemonium my phone never stopped ringing
2394236 i notice nordsjalland are playing on sunday wednesday and sunday so ill be doing my utmost to get out there to denmark and see them for myself as i say it wont be easy but were confident and well be give it our best shot
2394237 given the huge success of the governments hm armed forces veterans bevin boys and womens land army badges i think it is time to turn attention to war time munitions workers who played an equally important role in the war effort
2394238 many people including vast numbers of women worked in munitions factories in dumfries and galloway during the war in towns like dumfries dalbeattie powfoot and carsegowan near wigtown
2394239 and understandably ive been approached by many local former munitions workers wondering when itll be their turn for some well deserved recognition
2394240 1 what can be said at all can be said clearly 2 and whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent
2394241 there was an incident involving angie everhart and her boyfriend
2394242 he was gone from the location of the incident before deputies arrived
2394243 there were minor injuries but they did not require medical attention he was subsequently booked for misdemeanor spousal battery
2394244 i lived in new york a long time i love your paper
2394245 ground for praise rather than just an injunction to praise
2394246 when we begin to glimpse the reality of god the natural reaction is to worship him
2394247 the results have been very good weve seen very steady performances with no major surprises the pupils have worked hard which is what we expect at this school
2394248 its too early to have done an in depth analysis but on first impression we are satisfied with the results in the standard grades in particular there has been an improvement from last year and were fairly satisfied overall
2394249 were really pleased with the results across the board from third year up to sixth year
2394250 not an image must be one of the following types

2394253 i was very careful and paranoid because i didnt want my wife cyn to know that there was something going on
2394254 the extent to which they must have known in their souls that they had an especially fine hook going for them in this song is likely borne out by the way in which it is used repeatedly throughout to almost hypnotic effect
2394255 im amazed at whats happening people are coming and were not getting any lower in attendance its like more people are coming we always have visitors
2394256 we all tighten our belts here and there and weve not sensed that people are tightening their belts in what they are willing to give for the lord and for his work
2394257 people really gave sacrificially for this to happen and theyre continuing to do so because they believe in what were trying to do here
2394258 lots of times faith gets bigger and people pull together and i think thats happening at other churches around too
2394259 we have some families where they just dont have the gas money if you hear that you see someone going right over and saying well help what do you need this content requires the latest adobe flash player and a browser with javascript enabled

2394493 but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord
2394494 but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him
2394495 whoever will call on the name of the lord will be saved
2394496 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2394497 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2394498 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2394499 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2394500 when i arrived early and pouring a cup of coffee i noticed the coffee pot had a service sticker on the side yet only 5 personnel work in this department paying a vendor a monthly fee to service a coffee machine that only 5 people use is the most inefficient thing i have ever seen

2394504 obama said the brouhaha over whether clintons delegates would be able to vote for her at the democratic convention was a media creation
2394505 there hasnt been controversy other than what you guys are projecting right now
2394506 those memos wont make obama more electable but if they expose something the media hasnt much mentioned they might just make him less electable
2394507 now that things are coming back to normal were back to talking about the elections in the u
2394508 he told me standing in a stone courtyard outside the university as we talked we were joined by other students eager to share their views on elections here in kenya and in the u s
2394509 truth be told its either you have the traditional mccain who is like the rest of the presidents that the u s has had or you have a black man who has african roots or you have a woman i dont think americans have been faced with such a decision before and thats part of the excitement
2394510 people are more caught up with the image of who he is than really with his policies
2394511 most people are proud that obama has a kenyan father
2394512 most people especially right now did not believe in the american dream in a way but if the son of an immigrant can become president then anything is possible just the chance is good enough for us
2394513 obama has a piece of kenya he has a piece of the luo ethnic group he has a piece of islam

2394528 although the residential financing market space in india is about rs 1 lakh crore and the market in kolkata is around rs 2 000 crore it is expected to grow at a much faster rate compared to the other metros in the next 2 3 years
2394529 slowly but steadily the other markets are getting saturated and the kolkata market being relatively cheaper provides a better alternative
2394530 the west bengal government is looking for inclusive growth and by providing incentives by encouraging public private partnerships not only in the higher end segment like commercial buildings but also in the middle and lower segments as well which consist of mostly small housing projects
2394531 there is a huge demand in kolkata for affordable housing flats which range between rs 15 lakh and rs 25 lakh but the developers are most active in the premium range flats between rs 25 lakh and rs 50 lakh hence with the state government providing incentives affordable housing space looks most attractive in kolkata

2394573 from credible and unrelated sources cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment

2394583 of the different malicious attacks outlined in this document conventional attacks on transport systems are judged to be some of the more likely to occur
2394584 this assessment is supported by the many examples of this type of attack perpetrated by different groups across the globe
2394585 the use of some cbrn materials has the potential to have very serious and widespread consequences
2394586 an example would be the use if a nuclear device there is no historical precedent for this type of terrorist attack
2394587 this new government seems to be totally ignoring the legal rights of italian citizens repatriated from libya in 1970
2394588 mr president we are referring to todays meeting with the libyan prime minister in order to remind you as on various occasions in the past weeks that the accord with libya ever more necessary for the illegal immigrants emergency cannot leave out of consideration an internal collateral provision on the final compensation of the repatriated for their goods confiscated by gaddafi in 1970

2394596 the actions of the georgian side led to deaths among them are ten russian peacekeepers 30 wounded the situation reached the point that georgian peacekeepers have been shooting at russian peacekeepers i as the president of the russian federation must protect lives and the dignity of russian citizens wherever they are

2394664 ive got the joy joy joy joy down in my heart
2394665 these are troubling statistics that warrant more aggressive education prevention and testing initiatives
2394666 at each of our testing sites we are seeing an increasing number of young gay men particularly african american men coming to us newly infected
2394667 these are young men who dont remember the first wave of the hiv aids epidemic and came of age when effective treatments were available as a result they have never seen hiv as a major problem
2394668 one surprising theme emerged even though everyone recognized hiv was a serious issue every group identified hiv as really being a problem for another demographic group
2394669 this is of great concern because the highest risk groups do not identify themselves as being high risk and thus increase their susceptibility to hiv through unsafe behavior and a lack of knowledge
2394670 it was very shocking to me to watch it come in
2394671 the night i took the vote in june i was told i would never be elected again im running unopposed
2394672 if i were to have a major challenger that money could have played an important role in being able to get out the message
2394673 i think people who do the right thing should remain in office
2394674 its a strong belief among many republicans that its not the way to go its a core belief that we have we stick with our core beliefs
2394675 many of them are a bunch of fossils from a bygone day
2394676 constituents have changed more of us represent a district in which theres a lot more people of diverse views
2394677 thats why these donations come in they want to send a message that you can be a republican you can vote for gay marriage and you can be re elected
2394678 im very appreciative of it it makes it easier for other legislators in other states to stand up and do whats right
2394679 this is money i would never have been able to raise
2394680 i wanted it recognized that my vote counted i told them i was prepared to leave the conference
2394681 in reflection of how critical it has become for the us military to retain native language and cultural know how in its ranks
2394682 the militarys conventional language training program the defense language institute in monterey calif could not churn out enough american soldiers proficient in arabic kurdish dari pashtu and farsi and the military quickly turned to private contractors to fill the gap
2394683 numerous programs have sprouted up including one at fort lewis wash where soldiers are given a 10 month immersion program in language and culture
2394684 can we marry up those two or maybe thats the wrong word can we have some kind of union of those two issues
2394685 well it seems that the military has gone around and fired a whole bunch of people who speak foreign languages farsi and arabic etc
2394686 for some reason the military seems more afraid of gay people than they are against terrorists but theyre very brave with the terrorists if the terrorists ever got a hold of this information theyd get a platoon of lesbians to chase us out of baghdad
2394687 the dont ask dont tell policy is not only wasteful and inefficient its unfair and un american in the middle of a war we are throwing out good people who have volunteered to put their lives on the line for their country
2394688 recognize respect protect and celebrate all of the loving families they seek to represent
2394689 but we also have to do more to support and strengthen lgbt families because equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle its about whether millions of lgbt americans can finally live lives marked by dignity and freedom thats why we have to repeal laws like the defense of marriage act thats why we have to eliminate discrimination against lgbt families and thats why we have to extend equal treatment in our family and adoption laws
2394690 ill be a president that stands up for american families all of them
2394691 regardless of their sexual orientations and gender identities regardless of how many parents or caregivers are present in a family all parents begin each day with their children at the forefront of their thoughts on behalf of diverse families it is critical to know how the platforms of our candidates will address lgbt and other diverse family needs
2394692 recognize respect protect and celebrate all of the loving families they seek to represent
2394693 but we also have to do more to support and strengthen lgbt families because equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle its about whether millions of lgbt americans can finally live lives marked by dignity and freedom thats why we have to repeal laws like the defense of marriage act thats why we have to eliminate discrimination against lgbt families and thats why we have to extend equal treatment in our family and adoption laws

2394700 part of the queensland curriculum for mathematics for all students who are doing pre voc pre vocational maths which is the group of students to whom you are referring or indeed students who are doing the numeracy course is to equip them with information about the dangers of gambling
2394701 how the odds are stacked in favour of the gambling institutions and how easy it is for them to lose money
2394702 i cant comment on that im not sure but if that had been done then that would be a very sensible way for them to get an idea of how quickly money can be lost
2394703 we do other things as well for example we get them to look at the probabilities of the various poker hands of course working out the probabilities of getting various poker hands is quite complex
2394704 for many years now there has been in existence such things as the stockmarket game where kids are able to pit themselves against the market against other participants in the market and thereby gain understanding of the risks relevant to return opportunities
2394705 but of course there are people who make a living out of betting on the horses
2394706 games of chance card games etc or wagers are not in themselves contrary to justice they become morally unacceptable when they deprive someone of what is necessary to provide for his needs and those of others the passion for gambling risks becoming an enslavement unfair wagers and cheating at games constitute grave matter unless the damage inflicted is so slight that the one who suffers it cannot reasonably consider it significant

2394711 for his age to be taken into consideration he didnt take my sons age into consideration
2394712 this is not a complicated case who did it and the manner of death
2394713 the issue is brandons age and what was going on at e o green school

2394715 its hard for anyone to contemplate that much less a 14 year old

2394759 we hebben inderdaad van 90 000 deelnemers indertijd teennagels opgestuurd gekregen door analyse van het seleniumgehalte in de nagels hebben we de relatie tussen selenium en borstkanker longkanker maagkanker dikke darmkanker en prostaatkanker bekeken bij long en prostaatkanker was het duidelijk dat een hoger seleniumgehalte in het lichaam gerelateerd is aan een lager risico selenium is nu n van de weinige stoffen die uit de eerste generatie gerandomiseerde trials naar nutri nten en kanker is overgebleven waar vervolgonderzoek naar gebeurt
2394760 ja het idee uit oudere onderzoeken was bijvoorbeeld dat b ta caroteen rokers bescherming tegen longkanker zou bieden maar in een trial onder 29 000 finse rokers deed het niets er bleek zelfs iets m r longkanker te ontstaan onder de mensen die b ta caroteen hadden geslikt een tweede amerikaanse trial bevestigde dit en sindsdien is het idee verlaten dat de anti oxydantwerking van b ta caroteen beschermt tegen kanker
2394761 de aanwijzingen voor b ta caroteen kwamen uit bevolkingsonderzoek waarin mensen wordt gevraagd welke voedingsmiddelen ze eten onderzoekers gaan dan met voedingsmiddelentabellen aan de slag en berekenen welke nutri nten die mensen in welke hoeveelheden binnen krijgen de belangstelling voor b ta caroteen was er omdat die stof in dierproeven beschermend werkte omdat in bevolkingsonderzoeken mensen met lagere b ta caroteengehalten in hun bloed een hoger kankerrisico hadden en omdat b ta caroteen als een component in de voedingsmiddelentabellen stond maar er zijn veel m r caroteno den het kan dus zijn dat er andere stoffen mogelijk een ander caroteno de achter zitten die wel een beschermende werking hebben dat is het gevaar van denken in het stramien van n nutri nt
2394762 nee ik geloof absoluut niet in n magic bullet tegen kanker in onze voeding in de eerste plaats omdat er heel veel verschillende soorten kanker zijn mensen verwachten dat een stof eenzelfde effect zal hebben op al die tumoren dat is helemaal niet het geval bij borstkanker is de relatie met voeding berhaupt veel zwakker gebleken dan eerst werd verwacht er is lang gedacht dat vet eten het risico op borstkanker verhoogt wij vonden in de nlcs echter geen verband en dat is later alleen maar bevestigd begin dit jaar nog in een amerikaanse trial borstkanker is veel meer een hormonaal bepaalde tumor bij maag darmtumoren ligt dit weer heel anders
2394763 jazeker we zeiden toen ook al met roken kun je stoppen maar met voeding niet het is dus zaak dat je mensen aan de gezonde voeding krijgt
2394764 de hoeveelheid voedsel die mensen eten blijkt een belangrijke oorzaak van kanker mensen met overgewicht hebben bijvoorbeeld een grotere kans op dikke darmkanker baarmoederkanker en slokdarmkanker een bepaald type carcinomen van de slokdarm adenocarcinomen komt steeds meer voor in de westerse wereld wat mogelijk komt door de epidemie van overgewicht een relatie met prostaatkanker zien we niet en het verband met borstkanker is ingewikkeld bij vrouwen n de menopauze is er een stijgende lijn van het risico op borstkanker vanaf een bmi van 21 tot een bmi van 28 29 daarboven vlakt het af maar op borstkanker v r de menopauze heeft een zeer hoge bmi van 31 of meer juist een beschermend effect deze uitkomsten zijn inmiddels geaccepteerd in de medisch wetenschappelijke wereld
2394765 nee ten eerste is een bmi van 31 niet een beetje dik dit betreft echt obesitas de epidemiologische adder onder het gras is dat borstkanker n de menopauze een stuk vaker voorkomt dan voor de menopauze de beste manier om je risico op borstkanker laag te houden is dus om slank te blijven dat helpt trouwens ook tegen veel andere ziekten wat ook borstkanker voorkomt is niet te veel alcohol drinken hooguit twee glazen per dag voor een vrouw het is lang omstreden geweest maar uit grote meta analyses is nu wel duidelijk dat er voor borstkanker een risicoverhoging van 7 8 procent is voor elk glas alcohol dat per dag wordt gedronken lineair van het begin af aan
2394766 nou bijvoorbeeld vis eten en groenten en fruit hoewel de effecten van groenten en fruit wat kleiner zijn dan eerst gedacht de bescherming door groenten en fruit is in de jaren zeventig voor het eerst gevonden in pati nt controle onderzoeken dat zijn dus onderzoeken waarbij je bij een groep pati nten die een tumor hebben vergelijkbare personen zonder tumor zoekt en dan gaat vragen naar hun voedingspatronen uit het verre verleden dat is dus iets anders dan bij een grote groep gezonde mensen de huidige voeding te meten en die mensen vervolgens jaren lang te volgen wat in onze cohortstudies gebeurt die worden als betrouwbaarder gezien beide soorten onderzoeken hebben overigens methodologische valkuilen het is bijvoorbeeld mogelijk dat iemand andere antwoorden over zijn consumptiepatroon geeft als hij pati nt is dat effect zie je vooral bij pati nt controle onderzoeken waarbij mensen achteraf vragenlijsten invullen cohortstudies kunnen we gebruiken om deze methodologische valkuilen te onderzoeken
2394767 in de pati nt controle onderzoeken werd steeds een verhoogd maagkankerrisico gevonden bij mensen die weinig groenten en fruit aten in onze cohortstudie was het effect bij maagkanker echter veel lager naar de oorzaak van dat verschil hebben we lang gezocht kijk kanker is voor onderzoekers een gruwelijk gecompliceerde ziekte een kanker die aan het licht komt is vaak al tien tot twintig jaar eerder ontstaan in n enkele cel die sindsdien onopgemerkt is blijven groeien een methodologische kwestie in cohortonderzoek is dan of de meting van de voedselconsumptie bij het begin van het onderzoek wel iets zegt over een tumor die een of twee jaar later wordt gevonden wij hebben daarom bij maagkanker een onderscheid gemaakt tussen de vroege en late maagkankergevallen voor de maagkankers die direct na de voedselconsumptiemeting van 1987 en 1988 aan het licht kwamen zagen we een sterk verband die pati nten hadden in 1986 een veel lagere inname van groente en fruit de mensen bij wie de maagkanker later aan het licht kwam hadden nauwelijks een lagere inname in 1986 onze verklaring daarvoor is dat mensen waarbij nog geen maagkanker is gediagnosticeerd langzamerhand wel last krijgen van die groeiende tumor en kennelijk minder groenten en fruit gaan eten
2394768 verrassend genoeg niet met de opkomst van de moleculaire epidemiologie vroegen wij ons af of er uit die nagels dna was te halen samen met leo schouten janneke hogervorst en genetisch toxicologen in maastricht hebben we daar veel werk in gestoken en het blijkt goed te gaan je kunt genotypes bepalen een grote vraag in het kankeronderzoek is op het ogenblik hoe het zit met genetische aanleg bijvoorbeeld het vermogen om voedingsstoffen te metaboliseren in combinatie met voedselconsumptie daar zouden wij nu onderzoek naar kunnen gaan doen we moeten echter eerst kijken hoe dit medisch ethisch ligt zoals we voor eerder genetisch onderzoek aan tumorweefsel van onze deelnemers ook toestemming vroegen die kregen we

2394797 in september 2003 cia officials at the direct command of then cia director george tenet and at the behest of the white house deliberately forged a backdated letter from iraqi security chief tahir jalil habbush to saddam hussein the phony letter claimed that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had trained for his mission in iraq and that al qaida had facilitated mysterious shipments from niger to iraq
2394798 an extremely reliable and well placed source in the intelligence community has informed me that ron suskinds revelation that the white house ordered the preparation of a forged letter linking saddam hussein to al qaeda and also to attempts made to obtain yellowcake uranium is correct but that a number of details are wrong the suskind account states that two senior cia officers robert richer and john maguire supervised the preparation of the document under direct orders coming from director george tenet not so says my source tenet is for once telling the truth when he states that he would not have undermined himself by preparing such a document while at the same time insisting publicly that there was no connection between saddam and al qaeda richer and maguire have both denied that they were involved with the forgery and it should also be noted that preparation of such a document to mislead the media is illegal and they could have wound up in jail

2394887 the diversity of perspectives of the early followers of jesus christ was later replaced by the monolithic homogeneity imposed by emperors to make christianity a uniform religion throughout their empires as the pauline gentile faction grew in numbers and power and the catholic church of rome assumed orthodox authority over christianity it absorbed and codified mystical christianity in much the same way that rabbinical judaism assimilated and obscurated the mystical qabalah the essential jewishness of early christianity was virtually wiped out by the massive revisionism of the pauline gentiles

2394903 it was arid us but from henceforth it will be thespesius that is sent by the gods for indeed thou art not dead but by the will of the gods thou art come hither with thy reason about thee whilst thou hast left the rest of thy soul as it were an anchor in the body and this thou mayest now and hereafter prove to thyself by the fact that the souls of the dead cast no shadow and never close their eyelids
2394904 that which is effected by punishment while a man is still alive resembles a method of chastisement in vogue with the persians among others when they strip the clothes and headresses off the culprits and scourge the former while the latter entreat them with tears to stop
2394905 accordingly whenever a man leaves that world for this unpunished and impure justice grips him by the soul just as he is naked unable to put anything on and so hide and cloak his villainy but every bit of him in full view of every one on all sides
2394906 and first of all he is shown to his good parents if such they are or to his ancestors as an object of loathing and a disgrace to the family whereas if his forebears are bad he has to look on their punishments and they on his and this continues for a long time until he has exhausted every one of his evil tendencies in pain and toil which in extent and intensity as much exceed all suffering in the body as waking consciousness is more vivid than a dream
2394907 the colours of the souls of every shade and sort that greasy brown grey is the pigment of sordidness and selfishnes that blood red inflamed shade is a sign of a savage and venomous nature wherever blue gray is from such a nature incontinence in pleasure is not easily eradicated innate malignity with envy causes that livid discoloration in the same way as cuttle fish eject their sepia
2394908 now it is in earth life that the vice of the soul being acted upon by the passions and reacting upon the body produces these discolorations while the purification and correction here have for their object the removal of these blemishes so that the soul may become entirely ray like
2394909 as long as these colours are present there are relapses into the passions accompanied with pulsings and throbbings with some souls faint and soon suppressed but with others vigorously intensified
2394910 of these some by dint of repeated correction at length recover their proper disposition and condition others again by the strength of their intractability and their being nailed down to the love of pleasure are carried down to the bodies of beasts
2394911 the former through weakness of reason and inertia of the contemplative principle are carried down by the practical element to birth as men while the latter lacking an instrument for their unbridled lust long to unite desires to enjoyment and bring these together by means of any body for out of body there is only an imperfect shadow and dream of pleasure without fulfilment
2394912 you have not seen it nor will you be able to do so for the stern cable of your soul does not give or slacken further upwards but drags it down through being made fast to the body

2394958 now the spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by giving heed to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons through the pretensions of liars whose consciences are seared

2395103 with international attractions such as victoria falls the great zimbabwe stone ruins lake kariba and extensive wildlife tourism historically has been a significant segment of the economy and contributor of foreign exchange
2395104 with considerable hydroelectric power potential and plentiful coal deposits for thermal power station zimbabwe is less dependent on oil as an energy source than most other comparably industrialized countries but it still imports 40 percent of its electric power needs from surrounding countries primarily mozambique only about 15 percent of zimbabwes total energy consumption is accounted for by oil all of which is imported zimbabwe imports about 1 2 billion liters of oil per year zimbabwe also has substantial coal reserves that are utilized for power generation and coal bed methane deposits recently discovered in matabeleland province are greater than any known natural gas field in southern or eastern africa in recent years poor economic management and low foreign currency reserves have led to serious fuel shortages

2395132 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen

2395135 perhaps the most alarming issue we are seeing with black henna tattoos is the increase in the number of children even children as young as four who are getting them and experiencing skin reactions
2395136 kids make up a significant portion of the population that receives temporary tattoos because parents mistakenly think they are safe since they are not permanent and are available at so many popular venues catering to families in fact nothing could be further from the truth
2395137 each exposure to ppd re challenges the immune system so each time you get a black henna tattoo or use a hair dye that contains ppd there is an increased risk of having a reaction
2395138 many people are sensitized to ppd but dont have a reaction to it however each time you are exposed to black henna you increase your risk of developing a lifelong allergy to it

2395141 as a coach im going to have to do a good job of balancing the short and long term picture

2395144 as an offensive coach anytime you have a guy at that position with experience you progress a lot faster in camp
2395145 when can i get the best price for my vacation
2395146 i finally had the guts to watch the appalachian game
2395147 we dominated the game its hard to believe watching the tape that we lost that game
2395148 everyone in towns mad because we lost the appalachian game
2395149 we fumbled the ball at the 8 yard line if you read my e mails youd think wed never coached a down
2395150 and i think thats the mindset of the whole team
2395151 when you say chattanooga or bust i think we have a great shot we had a great shot last year were going to play for championships here we recruit them to play in front of packed houses for championships we dont want anyone around us that cant handle the pressure
2395152 we were ranked 101st in the nation last year in fumbles lost because we were playing all those young kids
2395153 we only threw five interceptions they were all fumbles young running backs they remind you when they fumble that they should be standing over by you holding a clipboard
2395154 akeem jordan was starting for the philadelphia eagles last year and he could have been playing for us
2395155 that would have been good to have him last year
2395156 weve been around here in august before when we had three or four huge problems
2395157 these are problems but theyre not insurmountable problems you cant solve
2395158 when you put on the clothing you become someone else
2395159 even my most modern fitted clothes dont give me this look
2395160 they were bound to that style even more than women today and 99 percent of them wore their hair parted in the middle with no bangs
2395161 people say to me how do you do it but i always liked playing dress up
2395162 i think we lose something when we wear pants all the time
2395163 we must take care of the artifacts while preserving that 1850s feel

2395165 a semesters worth of study on this battle and this family
2395166 in staceys case her background in storytelling was especially significant
2395167 sometimes it doesnt matter if the defense knows what youre running its all about do you make the right decisions do you pull the ball when you need to pull it do you hand it off when you should
2395168 everything goes in cycles were all trying to stay ahead of the cycle i dont know that thats happened yet but im sure it will
2395169 a lot of quick release empty protection short routes high percentage passes
2395170 i can tell you im going to make sure we throw the ball more
2395171 i felt like we just could not get anything going
2395172 watching some of that pittsburgh film that weve gotten from west virginia the offense didnt actually execute that well
2395173 you still have to get out on the field and play
2395174 it looked like pittsburgh just stuck with their game plan
2395175 if they had a blitz on they kept it on and didnt let west virginia dictate the tempo of the ballgame
2395176 well kevin if you like talking about the content in your classes why dont you just befriend some of the other students and talk about it with them
2395177 the names of teachers must be disclosed only in sexual misconduct cases where the alleged misdeeds are substantiated

2395189 how may it be that thou shouldst know my wretched state
2395190 thy floods of tears perpetual and thy sighs breathed forth unceasing to high heaven arise and there disturb thy blissful state serene so grievous hath it been that freed from this poor being i at last to a better life have passd which should have joyd thee hadst thou loved as well as thy sad brow and sadder numbers tell
2395191 but i how can i cease to weep forlorn without thee nothing wretched desolate oh in the cradle had i met my fate or at the breast and not to love been born
2395192 why by consuming grief thus worn were it not better spread aloft thy wings and now all mortal things with these thy sweet and idle fantasies at their just value prize and follow me if true thy tender vows gathering henceforth with me these honourd boughs
2395193 thou mayst thyself reply whose pen has graced the one by many a lay the palm shows victory and in youths bright day i overcame the world and my weak heart the triumph mine in part glory to him who made my weakness strength and thou yet turn at length gainst other powers his gracious aid implore that we may be with him thy trial oer
2395194 are these the crisped locks and links of gold that bind me still and these the radiant eyes to me the sun
2395195 as they are wont behold in me a spirit among the blest enrolld thou seekst what hath long been earth again yet to relieve thy pain tis given me thus to appear ere i resume that beauty from the tomb more loved that i severe in pity win thy soul with mine to heaven from death and sin

2395241 it was an unprovoked attack on an unarmed man in his own home showing gross level of depravity
2395242 you were drinking on the night in question however that may explain your behaviour but provides no excuse
2395243 you planned to assault scott burgess in his own flat
2395244 once inside you locked the door and carried out a very long and unprovoked attack and i can see no reason for it whatsoever
2395245 so furious was the assault price managed to stab himself in the arm
2395246 mr burgess collapsed into unconsciousness or death and price then posed with his body brandishing his knife and smiling whilst one of the duncan girls photographed him on a mobile phone camera
2395247 it will be of little or no consolation to those who loved scott burgess but mr price says he wishes me to express his deep heartfelt remorse for what he has done
2395248 should a disruption in commercial oil supplies threaten the u s economy

2395256 i have a small store in ten years i hope my store is bigger i will need things that foreigners like a gringo came to my store and wanted toast and manchego cheese and a bottle of wine i dont have those things
2395257 i almost dont surf anymore i concentrate on work its been almost two years since i surfed much i have to be here attending to my clients providing good service im happy doing this

2395261 im happy i love it here i love these people
2395262 im in heaven thats it because there is nothing no people just nature and the best wave ive ever seen in my life one of the best and most beautiful things i ever feel
2395263 before the wave it was more poor we didnt have a road we only used the ocean for fishing we didnt know surfing
2395264 if you want to surf its open from 7 a
2395265 the world is pushing too much against these places they want development and hotels and things like that i know its complicated cause when you are really poor and you see a whole buffet for sure you will choose a buffet but if you know what is at the end of the table you will think about it the sad thing is that they didnt know what is at the end
2395266 they are going to come in here and rape the place and leave nothing but trash and shit around
2395267 people were just amazed by the wave they know of it without knowing many details about it its a bit of a myth
2395268 it was not my idea a few of the older members of the community said you know what you are one of us
2395269 i spent a lot of time here i wanted to know if my time here meant something to these people ive behaved myself you know ive contributed and my motives are always genuine i wanted to surf since im here surfing enjoying the beach i wanted to contribute

2395275 the companions of the messenger were the fastest people to break the fast at maghrib and the last to eat the sahoor i e they used to try to take it at the last possible moment
2395276 the people will continue to be in good condition as long as they hasten to break the fast
2395277 my nation would continue to be on my sunnah as long as they do not wait for the stars to come out before breaking the fast
2395278 the deen will be uppermost manifest as long as the people hasten to break their fast because the jews and the christians delay it
2395279 the messenger of allah used to break his fast before the maghrib salaat
2395280 there are three signs of prophethood hastening the breaking of the fast delaying the sahoor and placing the right hand on the ieft hand in the salaat
2395281 the prophet used to break his fast with fresh dates before he prayed if he did not find fresh dates then he would use dried dates if he did not find that also he drank a few sips of water ahmad and abu dawood what should be said at the time of breaking the fast
2395282 the supplications of three groups of peoples are not rejected the duaa supplication of the fasting person when he is breaking his fast the duaa of the just imam and the duaa of the oppressed
2395283 the thirst has gone and the veins have recovered and the blessing is established if allah wills
2395284 whoever gives someone something to break the fast with he would hove the same blessings as the fasting person and this would not reduce the blessings of the fasting person in any way
2395285 may the righteous eat your food may the angels send salaat unto you and may the fasting person break their fast with you
2395286 o allah feed the one who fed me and give drink to him who gave me to drink

2395295 they spent the mesne with regard to the moralization jurisdiction they might and main repute
2395296 stemmed from a momentary misunderstanding as to the exact location of the u s mexican border

2395534 i am not a has been i am a will be
2395535 americans will put up with anything provided it doesnt block traffic
2395536 they always say time changes things but you actually have to change them yourself
2395537 if a writer wrote merely for his time i would have to break my pen and throw it away
2395538 you should not live one way in private another in public
2395539 anything that has real and lasting value is always a gift from within
2395540 ive got to tell you insert name of fired network president here i think youre wrong
2395541 well i hope youre right because if you arent ill bury this show and you
2395542 they dont get it they keep trying to make it something else
2395543 ive got to tell you insert name of another network president here i think youre wrong
2395544 do over he doesnt even know me he knows the me that i was told to be by my agent
2395545 id say the experience was more about my wising up than becoming a visionary
2395546 but the moment i started chasing private equity money it didnt take me long before id realized that id short circuited the formula for getting a greenlight i didnt need studio approval all i needed was one guy who believed in the movie
2395547 the studios have got to be hoping that this idea about being entrepreneurs doesnt sweep over the tv show runners because once you start seeing really good production values on the internet i mean what does larry david really need hbo for
2395548 writers who create something rare a story with great original characters that movie stars will cut their price to play have a real value
2395549 but that value doesnt get unlocked in the studio system if writers are willing to share our risk then were willing to give them a lot of control and share in the profits too
2395550 anyone with an apple computer can make a movie now its never been a more democratic medium the studios should be very afraid once the independent financiers start going directly to writers things could change really fast i ask myself every week why arent we all working with them look at the movies theyve made they are the new medicis
2395551 ten million dollars to 30 million is where ambiguity stays alive where you can have complexity in storytelling
2395552 when you get up to a certain budget number with studio films the bad guys have to all wear black hats
2395553 they told me script approved as is ive never heard a studio ever say that
2395554 if i were someone like les moonves id be scared
2395555 you dont want your employees thinking about opening their own store around the corner we might be really tough competitors
2395556 the fringe benefits of failure and the importance of imagination
2395557 maybe mistakes are what make our fate without them what would shape our lives maybe if we had never veered off course we wouldnt fall in love have babies or be who we are after all things change so do cities people come into your life and they go but its comforting to know that the ones you love are always in your heart and if youre very lucky a plane ride away
2395558 later that day i got to thinking about relationships there are those that open you up to something new and exotic those that are old and familiar those that bring up lots of questions those that bring you somewhere unexpected those that bring you far from where you started and those that bring you back but the most exciting challenging and significant relationship of all is the one you have with yourself and if you can find someone to love the you you love well thats just fabulous
2395559 maybe some women arent meant to be tamed maybe they just need to run free til they find someone just as wild to run with them
2395560 i will never be the woman with the perfect hair who can wear white and not spill on it
2395561 its really hard to walk in a single womans shoes thats why you sometimes need really special shoes
2395562 godforbid i turn out to be normal not some magazine cover
2395563 playing pretend make believe it may be the one thing we never outgrow
2395564 in the end its the what ifs that hurt the most
2395565 the most minor event can affect everything and when that seemingly insufficient thing happens it sets everything else in motion the most minor event can change everything sometimes for the better even if it doesnt seem like it at first
2395566 i guess the funny thing about love you never know which way its going like me i lost but at least i went down swinging
2395567 sometimes the smallest victory is enough to get you through the day
2395568 i think the problem with most people who get what they want is that they then realize they dont want it anymore
2395569 there are moments when we all wish life was more like a sitcom
2395570 i think putting one in the win column gives us enough juice to keep going with the games we know were not gonna win
2395571 relationships dont work they way they do on television and in the movies will they wont they and then they finally do and theyre happy forever gimme a break nine out of ten of them end because they werent right for each other to begin with and half of the ones who get married get divorced anyway and im telling you right now through all this stuff i have not become a cynic i havent yes i do happen to believe that love is mainly about pushing chocolate covered candies and yknow in some cultures a chicken you can call me a sucker i dont care because i do believe in it bottom line its couples who are truly right for each other wade through the same crap as everybody else but the big difference is they dont let it take them down one of those two people will stand up and fight for that relationship every time if its right and theyre real lucky one of them will say something
2395572 that was a wonderful combo of verbal diarrhea and stun silence
2395573 photoshop you can do anything look here i have you wearing a ducks bill know why because youre a quack
2395574 fear knocked at the door faith answered there was no one there
2395575 theres no dishonor in failure the only dishonor would be not to try
2395576 hey please just you know talk to the school board and take a glance at my permanent record theres no comparison between you and i dawson everybody knows youre like youre a regular richie cunningham billy hes the fonz
2395577 what would you have him do instead join a book of the month club
2395578 so how does it feel to have a dream come true
2395579 how would i know do i look like im trapped in an elevator with kate hudson
2395580 on gay bowling night of course im embarrassed but its not the gay part thats embarrassing its the bowling
2395581 its become obvious to me that in life youre either a mac person or youre a pc person the choice defines you
2395582 cool the movie star i ordered from my teen beat catalogue finally arrived i was starting to worry
2395583 im scared that im gonna end up alone im scared that im always gonna be someones friend or brother or confidant but never quite someones everything mostly im scared im never gonna meet a guy that i love as much as i love you
2395584 that first kiss its the passionate one its the one filled by desire and attraction and all of that but the second kiss is rational you got time to worry and over analyze and most women they prefer that first kiss but im partial to the second one because its about something more
2395585 blowing stuff up and smashing windows is a great way to bring about animal liberation
2395586 outrageous and inspiring makes me want to get arrested again
2395587 this law brings the military within the scope of the constitution its a big step forward for the democratisation of the armed forces and for the justice system in general

2395601 in auctions and even in private party values have gone up because of the gas prices

2395616 the second full length cd of the bay areas one time misfits cover band now a full fledged horror rock band plan 9 the 13 originals seem to approach the classic middle walk among us era misfits as almost a genre they have the same well played catchy up tempo melodic punk with sung vocals and shouted chorus and 50s horror and sci fi themes like calabrese ghoul squad and other bands who have picked up this sound and run with it its often more enjoyable of a listen than the slowed metallic route the actual former misfits members since have taken while my tastes wish for a little more of the hardcore tooth and bite of earth a d plan 9 is only a tribute now in the sense that they excellently uphold this style they still drop a few misfits amp samhain covers into the mix including a great tom waits ish version of skulls that ends the cd fun ks

2395621 many christians are doing their own thing trying to live a life without jesus without even taking to him now often too jesus himself hath said without me you can do nothing nothing you cannot even understand gods truths

2395633 i dont think he had much of a choice at that point it doesnt sound like his options were closing in fast on him
2395634 it was a bit of a close encounter but no injuries to anyone no damage

2395674 its the manager and his management team who are responsible for paying out the players salary it is their judgement about how to use the money they paid to ljungberg in a wiser way
2395675 we all have our personal opinion about freddie and his efforts for this club
2395676 the signing of fredrik ljungberg in july 2007 was negotiated by the former chairman eggert magnusson and the financial discussions relating to the transfer had nothing to do with the manager alan curbishley who has never been involved in player transfer and contract negotiations
2395677 all financial matters are controlled by the board with the manager playing a full role in the identification and recommendation of players
2395678 as stated previously the termination of ljungbergs contract was agreed mutually and was in the best interests of west ham united and the player
2395679 curbishley may also give another run out to free agent ben thatcher

2395703 it is shameful that a journalist should have been so ill treated by members of the israeli special police and left injured has israel no regard for law and order and are those responsible being prosecuted

2395719 i do think we need to examine the issues of both gulf war syndrome and the anthrax vaccine and how they can be dealt with they are political problems for us
2395720 it didnt bother me that rove referred to it as a political problem at the time because it meant that it would be properly dealt with finally
2395721 the political problem became a problem to me when they dropped the ball and allowed the program to continue it was politics that motivated them to investigate and it was politics that motivated them to allow the program to continue now the political nature bothers me

2395724 has the unprecedented boom in biodefense research made the country less secure
2395725 adverse effects may include redness or swelling where the shot was given larger than the bottom of a soda can and or more than 24 hours of headaches muscle joint pains and or fatigue tiredness that interfered with your daily activities
2395726 bioport should not be able to keep that contract for years they never met any goals or objectives for years they got bonuses that equaled or exceeded their salaries and didnt accomplish their goals

2395830 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2395831 i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2395832 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2395833 and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority

2395844 it is not hypocritical to say that what clinton did was wrong while also having an affair what is hypocritical is to call on him to resign or try to remove clinton from office while also holding a public office and having an affair as newt gingrich did that is hypocrisy

2395906 the common hours of business are from 8 a m till 11 p m in the winters in the summer from or half past 6 a m til 12 at night during the fashionable season that is from april till the latter end of july it frequently happens that the ordinary hours are greatly exceeded if there is a drawing room or grand fete or mourning to be made it often happens that the work goes on for 20 hours out of the 24 occasionally all night
2395907 the general result of the long hours and sedentary occupation is to impair seriosuly and very frequently to destroy the health of the young women
2395908 thinks that no men could endure the work enforced from the dress makers

2395913 it is wonderful that our nation has made a commitment and this administration deserves a lot of credit for designating the worlds largest marine reserve but there is a responsibility that goes along with that
2395914 unfortunately in recent years the u s has not made picking up trash in our most special places in the ocean a priority
2395915 decided to reduce its level of commitment to removing marine debris and only address new accumulations
2395916 the administration is not keeping pace and this is disappointing
2395917 it is very disappointing here you have this designation as a monument and there has been less visible activity going on in the monument
2395918 additional cleanup and prevention resources are needed to protect this marine national monument
2395919 its asking a lot for a monument proclamation to do that but you have to start someplace
2395920 we can pick up plastic off the beach from now until the end of time but unless people stop putting it in the ocean our problem will never go away
2395921 i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2395922 no not building this to sell you wouldnt want to sell this if you had one believe me its a once in a lifetime project i did this alone no help i have found with other things in the past that if you have help the help often does not get it parts right and you have to do it over 95 of the time plus i like to work alone all parts are scratch built cept tires rims brakes engine etc meaning all bodyparts brackets just about everything external on the car yes i will do a batpod and tdk suit for myself i love building this stuff
2395923 she has never been in any trouble besides this that doesnt mean she didnt do what was alleged
2395924 but she didnt get a fair trial and everyone has a right to a fair trial
2395925 id like to see her come out of there in a hearse
2395926 thats the way she should come out there dead you know not that we hate her or anything
2395927 the government is committed to a more disciplined approach to managing spending
2395928 certainly we felt some of the groups were not necessarily ones we thought canadians would agree were the best choices to be representing them internationally
2395929 i dont even want to say it their name on the phone
2395930 some of the groups we felt had little to do with our foreign policy or how canadians would want us to be perceived abroad
2395931 abolishing this program is the equivalent of killing the entire culture market abroad
2395932 these all seem to indicate concerns that are based in personal taste and conservative ideology rather than in how to best reflect the diversity of culture in canada and how best to represent canadian cultural expression
2395933 it really does seem to play to the most right wing part of the conservative party
2395934 it doesnt strike me as a strong political strategy for a government that is facing re election and byelections
2395935 we are still supporting arts funding including international arts promotion
2395936 even before the shows opening in minneapolis a national tour to begin in september 2009 was booked
2395937 your mind just races with all we could do and it is just so exciting for us
2395938 will we have a show like that no will we have a show thats wholly canadian of course it will and it will inspire the world
2395939 but also if they can do that then i can do something as creative
2395940 the things were planning to do are on track and judging from what ive heard about the timing for beijing and where they were at certain times were in good shape

2395942 it reminds us that the next time our olympic athletes take part in the opening ceremony and the next time the drama of the olympic cauldron lighting stirs everyones hearts as it did tonight it will be at home in 2010
2395943 what a proud night for china and for all canadians as we get ready to be the next host and share that same stage of honour
2395944 i live here where my left and right foot are i am where my feet are at home

2395946 and they over came him satan by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony the blood of jesus is a power unequaled and adds to the heavenly armor described in ephesians 6 15 18
2395947 the lesson for plaintiffs is in the vast majority of cases they are perceiving the defendants offer to be half a loaf when in fact it is an entire loaf or more
2395948 what i would want them to look at was whether or not the lawyers had a strong financial incentive to go to trial
2395949 im not suggesting the answer because i dont know but that would be my question
2395950 most of the time one of the parties has made some kind of miscalculation or mistake
2395951 the interesting thing about it is the errors the defendants make are much more costly
2395952 its entirely possible that the attorneys are not giving adequate advice
2395953 an attorney could advise a client that they have a strong defense to enforcement of a contract but that is not the same thing as forecasting what the likely outcome at trial would be
2395954 its peculiar if any field is not improving its performance over a 40 year period
2395955 part of it is judgment and part of it is diplomacy
2395956 are associated with cases in which contingency fee arrangements are common
2395957 on the defense side high error rates are noted in cases where insurance coverage is generally unavailable
2395958 if you approach a class of students and say ill either write you a check for 200 or we can flip a coin and i will pay you nothing or 500
2395959 we have concluded based on laboratory access records witness accounts and other information that dr hatfill did not have access to the particular anthrax used in the attacks and that he was not involved in the anthrax mailings
2395960 weve had a seven year investigation and 15 million spent on it and one of the people of interest bought off for 5 8 million over what was obviously an f b i screw up
2395961 we were able to determine that at no time could that individual be put in the presence of that flask from which these spores came
2395962 if you need to use power go ahead but see if you can do a simulated engine out landing
2395963 so if you have an engine out at 9 000 you circle to get here and you know what to do from here a regular landing without power
2395964 well im pretty content with what im doing right now so when you come up with something lemme know
2395965 today i sat on my ass and did absolutely nothing the end
2395966 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2395967 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2395968 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2395969 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2395970 were going to have a very clear message about how the campaign will cooperate and how the convention will be conducted when its appropriate to make that announcement
2395971 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2395972 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2395973 what kind of feedback do you get from the customers
2395974 you i hold accountable because you know better than this
2395975 look if you can do this well at life while being underfed eating a fast food meal once every two days living off caffeine and skittles sleeping on average 4 6 hours a night and writing papers the night before theyre due just imagine what you could do if you ate right three times daily slept a full eight hours did things in an organized and planned way and tried not to have a mental break down every three months who knows what you could accomplish
2395976 memory visibility and public space reflections on commemoration s of 9 11
2395977 where the north west area might not have a lot of violent crime i think as far as property crime theft of vehicles theyre probably the higher end of the spectrum throughout the city because they have so much retail
2395978 timpul revolu iei e acum i locul e fix aici
2395979 communism killed 100 000 000 people and all ive got is this lousy shirt
2395980 i know how you feel i miss him too its been almost a week since hes gone
2395981 im sure he will somehow hell never leave you after all you are his precious client
2395982 i told him no just because they suddenly come around doesnt mean ive to be with them right this is a test or at least i think it is you see i claimed to love caine truly and suddenly all this princes charming come down falling from the sky i dont think its just a coincidence especially not after caine asked me that silly question of his
2395983 you know how caine is if i happen to fall for another you know what hell say i told ron we cant be together and that i wont regret but i will regret it if i present myself to caine as someone who falls so quickly for sweet promises men make by then i will really be just another girl to him that luc i cant live with
2395984 silly guy of course ill go on nurturing my feelings for caine he is the one i love after all now this sounds stupid but i always will love him how can i not when he was the one who taught me about life more than anyone else did how can i not when he is the reason i am who i am now one that the other guys seemed to like they like me for who i am now but they had no idea who i once was caine does he knew me since i was just a little baby the strange thing is ive no memory of him at all yet he tells me of myself as if he wrote a story and i am his character

2396090 all hearts thrilled with the proud hope that israel was soon to be honored before the nation as the head of a universal kingdom
2396091 as something strange and new these words fall upon the ears of the wondering multitude such teaching is contrary to all they have ever heard from priest or rabbi they see in it nothing to flatter their pride or to feed their ambitious hopes
2396092 the love of money is the root of all evil
2396093 1 timothy 6 10 the teaching of jesus regarding the relative position of rich and poor was new and it was accentuated by his disciples the apostle james said
2396094 hath not god chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to that love him
2396095 the poorest man i know is the man who has nothing but money
2396096 nothing carries man through the world like a true genuine and natural impudence
2396097 happy are they he said who recognize their spiritual poverty and feel their need of redemption
2396098 thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked
2396099 the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of god before you
2396100 a wretched poor and helpless worm on thy kind arm i fall
2396101 and being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ
2396102 for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is holy i dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones
2396103 but to this man will i look even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my word contrite

2396105 then job answered the lord and said behold i am vile what shall i answer thee i will lay mine hand upon my mouth once have i spoken but i will not answer yea twice but i will proceed no further
2396106 the lord also accepted job and the lord turned the captivity of job when he prayed for his friends also the lord gave job twice as much as he had before so the lord blessed the latter end of job more than his beginning
2396107 woe is me for i am undone because i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts
2396108 o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death
2396109 neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more
2396110 the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart o god thou wilt not despise
2396111 the tears of the penitent are only the raindrops that precede the sunshine of holiness
2396112 no deep seated love for jesus can dwell in the heart that does not realize its own sinfulness
2396113 the less we see to esteem in ourselves the more we shall see to esteem in the infinite purity and loveliness of our saviour a view of our sinfulness drives us to him who can pardon and when the soul realizing its helplessness reaches out after christ he will reveal himself in power the more our sense of need drives us to him and to the word of god the more exalted views we shall have of his character and the more fully we shall reflect his image

2396122 the government is committed to a more disciplined approach to managing spending
2396123 certainly we felt some of the groups were not necessarily ones we thought canadians would agree were the best choices to be representing them internationally
2396124 i dont even want to say it their name on the phone
2396125 some of the groups we felt had little to do with our foreign policy or how canadians would want us to be perceived abroad
2396126 abolishing this program is the equivalent of killing the entire culture market abroad
2396127 these all seem to indicate concerns that are based in personal taste and conservative ideology rather than in how to best reflect the diversity of culture in canada and how best to represent canadian cultural expression
2396128 it really does seem to play to the most right wing part of the conservative party
2396129 it doesnt strike me as a strong political strategy for a government that is facing re election and byelections
2396130 we are still supporting arts funding including international arts promotion

2396180 one of the most tragic things i know about human nature is that all of us tend to put off living we are all dreaming of some magical rose garden over the horizon instead of enjoying the roses that are blooming outside our windows today

2396221 through ruby red lips the devil slipped a thousand lies
2396222 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2396223 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2396224 i am honored to represent the united states at the opening ceremonies of the olympic games here in beijing
2396225 concerning tom fallon i am happy to convey to him the endorsement of on the basis of his exemplary pro life stance
2396226 in my life time i have met many famous and influential people yet i have never met a person who had an immediate impact on my life the way and magnitude that howard phillips has had
2396227 i have witnessed a room full of 300 people every one of them directly mentored and influenced by him waiting for hours just to say hello in my opinion he is americas champion
2396228 the declaration of independence states plainly that we are created equal endowed by our creator with basic human rights the first right is the right to life
2396229 americans have elected the best politicians that money can buy and these politicians have done a great job in representing special interests and big government i am running for state senate to represent the people of his district not any special interest group
2396230 i have people ask me why they should vote for me the constitution party candidate rather than the democrat or the republican
2396231 my answer is simple democrat candidates have come to us over the years and said elect me and ill solve your problems likewise republican candidates have told the voters elect me and ill solve your problems well after so many years of this and with our problems only getting worse i came to the realization that the democrat and republican politicians arent going to solve our problems the are our problem
2396232 im inviting the voters of the 4th middlesex district to do something bold to help solve this problem by electing a constitutionalist to be the state senator from the 4th middlesex district next tuesday december 11
2396233 there was pressure for all of us but for her it was even harder
2396234 im sorry but the chinese press is putting a lot of pressure on chinese athletes
2396235 she did a fantastic job im so proud of her
2396236 it was spectacular really unbelievable we liked it a lot
2396237 the heavy presence of chinese peoples liberation army officers throughout the proceedings left many wondering exactly what image the hosts were intending to project to the international community
2396238 this is the toughest course i have ever seen at a tournament event
2396239 sebagai perempuan berusia 27 tahun yang mengais rejeki dengan bermain biola aksi ji ah patut diacungi jempol apalagi selain bermain biola ia juga harus menunjukkan ekspresi muka dan air mata yang membuat penonton trenyuh
2396240 selama beberapa minggu terakhir kami melihatnya berlatih biola sampai larut malam dan kemampuan tersebut akhirnya ditunjukkan untuk pertama kalinya di adegan yang diambil di stasiun kereta bawah tanah meski awalnya terlihat gugup namun dukungan kru dan para pemeran lain membuatnya bisa melalui pengambilan gambar dengan mulus
2396241 untuk bisa bermain biola dengan bagus ji ah telah berlatih setiap hari dan bakal berusaha memberikan akting terbaiknya apalagi beethoven virus punya cerita dan alur yang menarik
2396242 but the way they said some of these things happen it could be a lot worse this is really the best case scenario
2396243 hope so got to hope so and work to get back but well see im trying to get back before that so i can practice
2396244 my thought is we have a guy like mitch and a guy like aaron that can jump in and take their shots at this thing until marks back in here and battling with them
2396245 this is an opportunity and how we deal with it and how we handle it is important not the fact that something happened
2396246 these two guys are more on the athletic side they really like to get out of the pocket and do things out of the pocket
2396247 we hate that it happened we hate for it to happen like that especially but we got an opportunity today to kind of show what we could do and had to take care of it
2396248 scotty tried to win the tournament tonight instead of waiting for a final table

2396253 tom fallon is a gentleman that has a passion for freedom in the terms of our founding fathers like john adams not only for today but for the future for his children and grandchildren i would urge all people that have a desire for true freedom to cast your vote for tom fallon
2396254 it has been my great pleasure to be associated with thomas fallon he is a man of dedication dedicated to his god his family his state and his nation his passionate defense of freedom is an inspiration to me his personal faith in the lord has been an encouragement during discouraging times what strikes me most about tom is his simple willingness to do whatever it takes when he sees a need he is the first to jump in and help he is not concerned about credit titles or praise his humility is refreshment to all who know him the people of the fourth middlesex district would have a true help and a true representative when they elect tom fallon as their next state senator
2396255 i have known tom fallon for quite a few years now in that time i have known him to be passionate about everything he becomes involved with tom is well rounded a lover of god lover of his wife and children and also a lover of his community state and nation as a co laborer with him for these several years in church issues as well as political issues i would strongly encourage the voters of the 4th middlesex district to cast their ballot for tom fallon a true voice for the people and the constitution
2396256 tom fallons commitment to government of the people by the people and for the people is real
2396257 there are a lot of holes out there that are almost unplayable

2396267 i cannot find a single convincing argument that tells me that astrologers wont do better than economists
2396268 what itll take is a national commitment spearheaded by leadership
2396269 especially in a matter as high profile as this the court was disappointed that much of the testimony particularly as it related to public figures within the state of new jersey and the dirty laundry associated therewith needed to be aired in the public and in the press

2396275 all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2396276 these attacks mark a dangerous and disproportionate escalation of tension as they occur across georgia in regions far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2396277 we are asking our friends and the united states among them to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of georgia
2396278 what we heard is that the state department and the entire administration is deeply concerned and that they are heavily engaged with russia trying to de escalate the situation
2396279 what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2396280 to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in
2396281 all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia

2396322 history makes it clear however that the legend of fanatical muslims sweeping through the world and forcing islam at the point of the sword upon conquered races is one of the most fantastically absurd myth that historians have ever repeated
2396323 which muslim army went to the east coast of africa
2396324 the sword indeed but where will you get your sword every new opinion at its starting is precisely in a minority of one in one mans head alone there it dwells as yet one man alone of the whole world believes it there is one man against all men that he takes a sword and try to propagate with that will do little for him you must get your sword on the whole a thing will propagate itself as it can

2396328 were butler and housekeeper to an old lady who left them the receipt recipe when she died the first sauce they made in a stew pan but the most amusing part was how his father advertised it there were no trains in those days so he went up by road waggon to london and took some sauce with him he used to call at the roadside inns where the waggoners had their dinners and give them all a drop and then give what was left to the landlady catch a man doing that now he puts a thundering great advertisement up with a painting of a sick lion in a net or a likeness of the queen to catch the eye and then rides about first class and does it all by correspondence

2396331 of their flesh shall ye not eat and their carcass shall ye not touch they are unclean to you

2396333 the world does not consist of 100 percent christians and 100 percent non christians there are people a great many of them who are slowly ceasing to be christians but who still call themselves by that name some of them are clergymen there are other people who are slowly becoming christians though they do not yet call themselves so there are people who do not accept the full christian doctrine about christ but who are so strongly attracted by him that they are his in a much deeper sense than they themselves understand there are people in other religions who are being led by gods secret influence to concentrate on those parts of their religion which are in agreement with christianity and who thus belong to christ without knowing it for example a buddhist of good will may be led to concentrate more and more on the buddhist teaching about mercy and to leave in the background though he might still say he believed the buddhist teaching on certain other points many of the good pagans long before christs birth may have been in this position and always of course there are a great many people who are just confused in mind and have a lot of inconsistent beliefs all jumbled up together consequently it is not much use trying to make judgments about christians and non christians in the mass

2396436 sometimes people see art and they rush to judge it
2396437 someone jumped to the conclusion that we were getting together with gang members to paint on the wall when in fact its quite the opposite its just a bunch of young artists who have access to a bigger canvas than theyve ever been afforded before
2396438 look at this wall all these vibrant colors stimulate the brain
2396439 this place draws so much attention i think if people see what the ashland is doing and how this art is catching on i think its just going to explode
2396440 one thing chicago doesnt have is a design review board like other cities have that says you cant paint rainbow colors on the side of a house beyond a certain standard complimentary to other homes
2396441 this happens in one place and its odd or whatever but if it multiplies in other areas where theres a high level of gang activity obviously well push to institute controls and find a way to regulate it
2396442 what were having now is a bigger conversation about what is the definition of art some people only have room for what they like others appreciate art as a whole
2396443 if you dont think this is art ill give you space on the wall and challenge you to paint lines as clean as these this is art you might not like it it might not be your style but this is art
2396444 youre good people in a hard place and you deserve this im glad i can help now and i know you have done it for others in the past and will do it again just enjoy it and kiss your beautiful granddaughter for me she is a blessing

2396453 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
2396454 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
2396455 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
2396456 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis
2396457 woah good thing im not very tall i dont much like lightning o o

2396477 this is a good day for the tigers the zoo and the people of iraq
2396478 our heart goes out to the two tigers who had to endure the long trip to iraq and a dangerous future at the baghdad zoo
2396479 these tigers will be caged helpless and completely dependent on humans to survive in an area where many people live in fear and are still without access to basic necessities
2396480 we have the utmost concern for the well being of the tigers
2396481 we have full confidence that the baghdad zoo has the staff and facilities to care for them long into the future
2396482 i am writing this letter as a personal endorsement of tom fallon i have known tom for twenty four years over the course of those years ive found tom to be honest loyal and hard working he is a man who knows how to put his mind to something and accomplish that goal
2396483 tom has always been a leader dedicated to the job at hand and guided by honorable principles it is my fervent belief that tom fallon would be a terrific state senator representing the 4 th middlesex district
2396484 he has always been a source of inspiration to me

2396501 its more satisfying to stay consistent all year long put up good numbers and help the team win
2396502 we did a lot of things well in the game but we had a couple breakdowns
2396503 just another game as far as the standings are concerned
2396504 its like playing in the backyard with your family its different that way but youve got to separate and move on
2396505 why do you want to stir up stuff like that hes been a good player his whole career and he had a good day i didnt notice thats just the way the game is today
2396506 its a good pitch none of the hitters know when im throwing it
2396507 i threw it a little bit in the american league with seattle about three times its just something extra to put in your head
2396508 you feel good because even if youre not getting a hit youre seeing the ball good when you feel good you hope to continue doing it
2396509 theyve pretty much told me that they are grooming me down here to pitch in the back end of the game up there
2396510 theyve made it clear to me that im down here for a reason and thats to get ready to get guys out in the last inning or two thats what im doing
2396511 the last thing i wanted to do was come down here and not get stretched out and have to come back to memphis and get my pitch count back up
2396512 i really believe that i can impact the team in a long term sense as a starter probably better
2396513 pitching coach dave duncan has made it pretty clear to me that next year ill be starting
2396514 the main thing for me is when im out there mentally knowing that im going to get that guy out
2396515 i have to come in and essentially close the door
2396516 now as you can tell he looks like a high level big 12 player were real pleased with his progress
2396517 im just trying to let them know that anybody can play just step it up play hard and dont get down on yourself
2396518 now that only means something when we continue to show progress as far as our performance
2396519 but as far as how the teams gone about our business how weve prepared what weve asked them to do how theyve handled all that to this point its been a great sign
2396520 were going to win some battles and lose some battles thats the way football is
2396521 i want us to not just execute the plays and the defenses i want us executing our tempo and our technique
2396522 we want to have a game where we give ourselves the best chance to win
2396523 i think thats the only way you can do it
2396524 those backups if they want to show what they can do theyve got to do it right
2396525 im not sure if youd call it anxiety but theyre going to be pretty pumped up you want to see how they perform when you put them under the lights for the first time
2396526 were making good progress and id hate to go into a game and go backwards
2396527 we know were only going to be in there for a couple series the first team so itd be good to leave a good impression and feel good about ourselves before we head back up to wisconsin
2396528 we didnt do much in the preseason so anything to change the momentum from last season it doesnt mean were going to do good in the regular season but at the same time its a change from last year and we can build on that
2396529 it depends on what we get done but that would probably be a fair benchmark right now and then the 2s would play hopefully a couple of quarters maybe more
2396530 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors
2396531 you have chosen as the theme of these games one world one dream that is what we are tonight
2396532 he came to camp with his mind on playing really good football and hes been playing very very well
2396533 he didnt make any excuses but he had reasons for not being as effective as he wouldve been
2396534 but ill tell you this he showed up every sunday and was on the field that said a lot about him
2396535 you have to maintain a high level of professionalism and do what you do normally thats part of sports and part of being an adult
2396536 every year you have something to prove in this league
2396537 you never know what year is going to be your last year its another opportunity to do something special especially after last year
2396538 named must your fear be before banish it you can
2396539 ok the time has come to upgrade from y2k to now because my children have grown up and we still have memories of installing php 4 in kinder garden
2396540 and i think were going to cure cancer and win the war both of them afghanistan and iraq
2396541 im glad to get out of there with what i did my short game was unbelievable today its just playing so tough
2396542 it is set up extremely difficult as any course ive ever played and nothing like the place we came and did so well at four years ago
2396543 its nearly more u s open like than the u s open is at the moment
2396544 its actually like they switched the two of them around this year if that makes any sense
2396545 ive got to think it has to be right up there with the best round i have played all year
2396546 yeah i think this is the round of the year for sure
2396547 i hit a couple out there that might have gotten close to 400 yards
2396548 thats probably the best ball striking day ive had all year the wind was blowing good enough today that i could go ahead and get over all the bunkers and i thought why not
2396549 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good if im hitting bad shots with it you dont hit it as much but if every time you hit it you hit it right where you looked whale away
2396550 in market parlance they are buying stock that has been beaten down a bit
2396551 this agreement also represents a resounding endorsement of the future of husky athletics
2396552 watching her in high school she played with so much heart and energy her going to tennessee definitely impacted my decision i wanted to follow in her footsteps
2396553 shes really served as an inspiration just with how hard she works
2396554 there are so many intangible qualities she brings her energy is contagious and unbridled it really impacts the other four people she plays with you cant hold her back
2396555 and we all know how much this means to her
2396556 the way were going to improve this situation is by education not only in latin america but here
2396557 when we build the academies we have to continue to invest in education
2396558 those leagues get started later obviously we push aggressively to do some testing that can lead to bunching of results depending on whats going on in the lab
2396559 he decided he wanted to produce his assignment as a web site with a little coaching i convinced him to look at googles and ebays services and have a little fun placing banner ads on his homework using the google and ebay web apis which support simple rest urls he was able to easily cut and paste the code needed without really understanding what the code did into his assignment and presto he was linked into both googles and ebays powerful soas several months later he has made over 5 on his homework from ad revenue this is a real motivator to do homework
2396560 by going the woa plus rest route instead of soa plus soap the requirements for extending the application dropped considerably
2396561 there is no soap processing stack with complicated wsdl documents an soa registry and what have you instead someone can easily create an extension to deki wiki using any number of computer languages
2396562 thus far i have interviewed only one company that i would classify as a soa success story
2396563 they need to get something sorted in sydney to look after the pacific island players a senior icon like nigel vagana could be used to help these guys
2396564 if the young guys are having trouble just go and talk to these older guys thats something they havent got
2396565 he probably got a lot of information from different parties that didnt help the cause
2396566 with the bulldogs and williams manager khoder nasser they could have worked something out but its gone the other way hopefully it doesnt wreck him
2396567 for everyone these days it would be tempting with the money theyre throwing around youve got to weigh up your options and where youre at and what your family needs
2396568 but its really about getting the right advice from the people you trust thats probably something that sonny didnt have
2396569 its sad for all his supporters and fans and new zealand rugby league its a huge hole and weve got to look for the next sonny bill
2396570 you only need to look at warriors under 20s theres a few boys coming through and thats positive signs
2396571 its nice that theres interest but im not going to rugby he laughed
2396572 you could see that as the game went on he got a little frustrated
2396573 okay you have to tell me what happens from here on out
2396574 this was in our estimation an extremely violent and unprovoked attack and in large part upon a defenseless individual
2396575 its very lucky that nobodys dead both vehicles were travelling too fast this accident wont be the last its a very dangerous stretch of road and one of the lorries was carrying too big a load it appears that as one of the lorries was overtaking the other one was braking and it skidded into some rocks we wont put up with dangerous driving in the vale one of these drivers may go to jail well know more when we open up the lorrys black box
2396576 today i am pleased to announce the launch of a road safety campaign in the vale and i am personally going to be managing it to make sure its a success and doesnt fail
2396577 fogerson says hed like to stay at running back and for now uw coaches say a move hasnt been discussed but at some point choices will have to be made
2396578 all you can do is try try and try again
2396579 some analysts think it could still surge to 500 the article noted
2396580 to us the presidential race reached a turning point last week when mccain opted for a campaign of denigration employing racial stereotypes sexualized talking points for surrogates obama as
2396581 warm and nice man who they were fans with for many years
2396582 the sisterhood of the traveling pants 2 is its younger version minus the chic couture and rampant materialism
2396583 the sisterhood of the traveling pants 2 resonates with the same spirit and warmth that made the first film a hit
2396584 no happily never after that just aint for me because finally i know i deserve better after all ill never let another teardrop fall
2396585 if theres one thing us white trash girls can be its a good olboy
2396586 eight of the piercings are in my face and most of the others are in my ears my main ear holes are stretched out to a half inch
2396587 you have chosen to look different so you shouldnt be surprised at the staring and the questions perhaps in the future you should consider moving to los angeles in this town everyone has seen almost everything and people who are different are less shocking
2396588 youve decided to alter your appearance and people are going to notice some of them are going to be curious enough to do more than look they will ask questions there is nothing illegal about what you are doing and you have a perfect right to pierce your body anywhere you want to dont be defensive answer their questions courteously and you might find that you have met a new friend its your decision and you should own it man up and walk proud skulk around and avoid eye contact and people will think there is something wrong with you whether you have piercings or not
2396589 whens the next raise coming can you sell just 5 more shirts a day do you get an annual bonus
2396590 because the crime is a class i felony he cant by law get prison time
2396591 for a class i such as possession of cocaine forgery and uttering obscenity with no prior history theres no prison time
2396592 and thats how he had access to the girls cell phone number
2396593 looked very hard to see if there were any other incidents and turned up nothing
2396594 guilty as charged there was no plea bargain or deal
2396595 if you let yourself stop to think about it climate change is an incredibly scary thing but most people dont let themselves think about it the overwhelm factor is just too much so having someone who can stand up in public and admit their fear but then also tell a really funny story about the whole situation can be an incredibly cathartic experience and inspire people to start taking action
2396596 you are going to go on a very long walk to climb a very tall mountain
2396597 yes i need you to be a very brave bear can you do that
2396598 the wrong sort of forest for small animals entirely on their own
2396599 lets put it this way petes sleeping a little better than he was about five months ago
2396600 hes thinking maybe i actually have a chance to hold on to this thing its not out of the question that 14 is going to be enough
2396601 its not going to be as easy to just mow through it the way most of us thought pete talked about 17 18 and i thought he was going to get it but you always hit that spot when it starts to get tougher
2396602 when pete hit 14 i thought god whos going to get there and its pretty amazing that roger has got so close roger is 27 today and how many did pete win after 27 it doesnt get any easier
2396603 he has had four of the greatest years in the history of open tennis since the sport went professional in 1968
2396604 no one roger pete he had an incredible run too you cant keep it up sooner or later the law of averages catch up to you
2396605 on some levels its a surprise obviously because federer was playing so great for so long that you start to think that losing it is never going to happen
2396606 but then you realize that hes a human being and nadals made some great improvement in the last year or so its well earned
2396607 he did something that hasnt been done since 1980 winning the french open and wimbledon back to back hes followed up with some wins in some other events so he deserves it
2396608 how many licks does is take to get to the center of a tootsie roll pop
2396609 i understand it to some point if i put myself into a favre fanatics shoes
2396610 the things i cant understand the things i really take personally is when im driving up to the parking lot gate and punching in my punch code and somebody says f you to me that kind of bothers me or when a little kid is yelling swear words at me that kind of gets to me the boos they expect a high level of play and they miss brett favre i understand that but the f you and the little kids saying swear words to me i dont understand that
2396611 oh i thought you were somone else you look like brian
2396612 oh um did you ever go to such and such high school
2396613 well dude its me so and so how you been

2396615 oh so was that your friend or your boy friend
2396616 oh well i thought you were gay i mean you look gay
2396617 i have been thinking of winning a medal but never thought it would turn out to be the first gold medal for china
2396618 the thing about pac is that he lives in so many parallel realities that theres no right way or wrong way to portray him hes truly an innovator of our universal hip reality
2396619 she was excellent i think shes going to surprise a lot of people with the way she really stretched herself for this role she charmed us all
2396620 in the north american visible church there is much famine of the word of god
2396621 i know most who call themselves christian are striving for unity but i still think im hearing the time has come to define the proper historic orthodox christian faith so precisely that no one can miss what we are saying
2396622 you are the christ the son of the living god
2396623 blessed are you simon bar jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father who is in heaven and i tell you you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it matthew 16 15 18 esv

2396653 i tried to figure out whether to stay and keep him breathing or leave and get some help i figured if i left he might die
2396654 the survivor would take the other guys body out to joshua tree have a few drinks and burn it
2396655 to permanently endow quality leadership for the mission of ecolife foundation
2396656 every breath you take every step you make ill be watching you
2396657 i took the hit that i was given and i bumped again and i bumped again
2396658 and i hope neil young will remember a southern man dont need him around anyhow
2396659 there sat a seven headed beast twin horns raised from his hand
2396660 when you hear how old i am youll shit bricks
2396661 no one expects us to be perfect so the best thing we can do for ourselves is to get out there and take action on our dreams
2396662 waking up each day from now on with balls the size of texas
2396663 my monster sword vibrates what the hell pulls sword out what is going on here this hasnt happened before
2396664 dont let go whatever is happening it might lead us to the tome of the seventh warrior
2396665 youre looking for a book that might of been written by a warrior over 600 years ago what kind of idiots go out into the world just for a book
2396666 the kind of idiots that will find the book and use its knowledge to destroy the magos oscuros
2396667 what the hell just happened to me one moment i was in my scabbard and the next master trent sir ben and nee san are all holding onto us in the air
2396668 i think the monster is at fault here he was vibrating again and baka san took him out of its scabbard and now danna sama tachi are hanging for their lives
2396669 this is interesting looks at his blade well i have to say this is a surprise okay i want you to take me to where you want to take me to
2396670 i dont know i just hope that we dont run into trouble
2396671 master trent nee san miss hellia we have a huge problem then just that bunch of magos
2396672 i had a village of family members but magos destroyed the village and my family was there mercy for women or children no i will have no mercy for damn magos you all shall die
2396673 i created a monster blade the perfect killing tool for monsters like the magos listen to me my sword i will use you to destroy the magos oscuros if you dont like it too bad i am both your master and creator you are mine
2396674 those are the ten problems these magos were waiting for their comrades we better get out of here
2396675 too late now here comes a new batch to the slaughter
2396676 hellia what should i do i never knowingly went into a battle
2396677 well from my point of view i say we have at least three options open to us the first one is to join the battle and fight along with baka san and trent chan
2396678 vampire that isnt what we were told we would be facing
2396679 this isnt a slaughter fest its a feast for my blade trent duck
2396680 these two morons are a diversion the real witch is up there
2396681 thats not a nice thing to say about nee san
2396682 if when you honestly want to you find you cannot quit entirely mental obsession or if when drinking you have little control over the amount you take physical compulsion you are probably alcoholic
2396683 they are restless irritable and discontented unless they can again experience the sense mental obsession of ease and comfort which comes at once by taking a few drinks
2396684 the main problem of the alcoholic centers in his mind rather than in his body
2396685 was i crazy i began to wonder for such an appalling lack of perspective seemed near being just that
2396686 the alcoholics under investigation were still childish emotionally sensitive and grandiose
2396687 you may be suffering from an illness which only a spiritual experience will conquer
2396688 unless this person can experience an entire psychic change there is very little hope of his recovery
2396689 the personality change sufficient to bring about recovery from alcoholism
2396690 ideas emotions and attitudes which were once the guiding forces of the lives of these men are suddenly cast to one side and a completely new set of conceptions and motives begin to dominate them
2396691 with few exceptions our members find that they have tapped an unsuspected inner resource which they presently identify with their own conception of a power greater than themselves
2396692 most of us think this awareness of a power greater than ourselves is the essence of spiritual experience
2396693 we find that no one need have difficulty with the spirituality of the program willingness honesty and open mindedness are the essentials of recovery but these are indispensable
2396694 the only effort necessary being that required to follow a few simple rules
2396695 almost none of us liked the self searching the leveling of our pride the confession of shortcomings which the process requires for its successful consummation but we saw that it really worked in others
2396696 so our troubles we think are basically of our own making they arise out of ourselves and the alcoholic is an extreme example of self will run riot though he usually doesnt think so above everything we alcoholics must be rid of this selfishness we must or it kills us
2396697 next we launched out on a course of vigorous action a strenuous effort to face and to be rid of the things in ourselves which had been blocking us from higher power our liquor was but a symptom so we had to get down to causes and conditions
2396698 where had we been selfish dishonest self seeking and frightened
2396699 we admitted our wrongs honestly and were willing to set these matters straight
2396700 we have a written inventory and we are prepared for a long talk
2396701 now we need more action without which we find that faith without works is dead now we go out to our fellows and repair the damage done in the past
2396702 let us think about the twenty four hours ahead we ask god to direct our thinking especially asking that it be divorced from self pity dishonest or self seeking motives
2396703 nothing will so much insure immunity from drinking as intensive work with other alcoholics it works when other activities fail this is our twelfth suggestion carry this message to other alcoholics you can help when no one else can remember they are very ill
2396704 burn the idea into the consciousness of every man that he can get well regardless of anyone the only condition is that he trust in god and clean house
2396705 brother what did you do to them to make them cry
2396706 i told them about the day our village was destroyed and the aftermath something i never told you because i didnt want you to be poisoned like i am
2396707 im not sure but this poison will kill me its only a matter of time so i dont want you to have this poison in your heart
2396708 the aftermath you mean after we were separated from mother right you told me that a wind storm blew me into the air and you chased after me and mother flew in the other direction like the rest of the villagers i know its sad but not enough to make someone cry snaps head up and looks at ben unless that story was a lie brother you didnt tell me what really happened did you
2396709 what happened to mother tell me brother i want to know the truth of that night
2396710 its the reason why i said those two are traitors put two and two together trent
2396711 okay this is just like what master ake had me do before the clues were given to me earlier in the day and the question was after the day had ended lets see what all happened today we left spiders inn with coatl and hellia alive coatl got onto brothers nerve by mention mister koron and keith brother then told nee san the truth about the aftermath and she was crying along with hellia hmm this is harder then anything master ake gave me to figure out lets try looking outside the box and look farther back the reason he hates magos is related to keith and mister koron that living whip which made brother hate all living weapons and then there is the fact that even though we were close to our village after the storm and we never saw another villager
2396712 what has you riled up monster dont you realize that its night time and its time for sleep
2396713 what he said some of us arent monsters like you are
2396714 its really hard to understand you why not just speak me and hellia over there can hear weapon spirits
2396715 you can hear other weapons that arent classified as living
2396716 yep we can do so with ease since we are spirits to begin with we can hear our own kind but understanding the monster over there is hard i guess until ben decides to fully awaken that thing we wont know what its name is or what it is trying to say
2396717 here for a moment i thought i would be able to bargain with brother the truth about mother for his blades true name why do you two keep calling brothers blade a monster
2396718 we call it a monster because of the baiorumetaru that its made up of
2396719 before you ask about the pressure thing its just a term used to the pressence of that spirit
2396720 oh i have an idea pulls coatl out can you help me figure out what happened that day the village was destroyed
2396721 i can do better then that master trent since i was made before the village my spirit knows all that happened there since my creation including how many times you were hit on the head by master ake
2396722 brother has been keeping that a secret so i wouldnt become sad whats the use of travelling when your hopes are dashed mother is dead and its all keiths fault waaaaaaaa
2396723 trent stop crying and control yourself youre causing an earthquake let go of coatl
2396724 why did you hide the fact that mother and maybe the whole village is dead and that keith was behind mothers death
2396725 i didnt want you to want revenge for mother im already poisoned with the hatred of magos and the thought of killing keith for murdering mother
2396726 so thats why you want to destroy them all to make sure you get keith and those who destroyed our village i understand but i dont understand why you wont let me practice magic with coatl
2396727 keith practiced magic and began hungering for more power i dont want you to have that craving coatl is a living weapon and an extension of you if you become evil he will as well same goes for miss ashley and hellia well its morning now lets put out the fire and start walking
2396728 that cant be true he didnt even want me to come along why would i have any feelings towards him
2396729 you realize you are talking out loud right miss ashley and from what i just heard you were talking about me werent you he didnt even want me to come along that was my original idea of leaving you at spiders inn but since i made a mistake you ended up coming with trent by the way you drool in your sleep
2396730 you drool in your sleep how else would you explain this wet spot on my shirt and the liquid on my arm
2396731 you two looked like a couple last night as i tried to figure out the puzzle
2396732 i just realized something if you two were on guard duty last night and you stayed up last night how can you be awake and energize
2396733 oh that chuckles me and brother are strange like that we take turns when we sleep he slept last night so tonight i sleep and then the next night we both stay up
2396734 its a trap that discourages work amp rewards illegitimacy and were keeping it
2396735 hospitals are either eating the cost or passing it along to insurers so you and i are paying it in increased premiums
2396736 some companies seem to figure no one is watching so they can get away with it
2396737 wouldnt want to be the one who effs up in that drum group
2396738 the block thing kind of looks like those things they sell in spencers you know the ones where you put your hand or your face or whatever body part you think would shock the public the most and it leaves an imprint those blocks are people
2396739 on display tonight things china has given us including paper fireworks kites and undoubtedly some opium
2396740 i think that china is just trying to show off how vast their population is theres no reason to have thousands of people in each and every performance
2396741 when you pick up one end of the stick you pick up the other end
2396742 this has been a difficult week and a half for us
2396743 we lost our family dogs we did it at the hands of sheriffs deputies who burst through our front door rifles blazing
2396744 i heard gunfire shoot off there was a brief pause and more gunfire
2396745 i noticed my two dead dogs lying in pools of their own blood
2396746 she was literally in the kitchen cooking a lovely pasta dish and they brought down the door and shot our dogs
2396747 they didnt know my name all they knew was my wifes name they matched that to the registration of the car
2396748 it was that lack of communication that really led to what has really been the most traumatic experience of our lives
2396749 i didnt sign up for this fight but i think what we have to do now is make changes to how prince georges county police and prince georges county sheriffs department operate
2396750 the special operations team that supported us made a decision about the necessity of entry at the point of being on the scene
2396751 weve done these similar kinds of operations over and over again to the tune of removing billions of dollars of drugs from the community and without people or animals being harmed
2396752 we dont want any of our operations to result in the injury or loss of anybody and certainly not animals
2396753 i would say that the dogs presented a threat i would imagine to the special operations situation
2396754 the virtuous leader can pass across his subjects with the ease of the wind
2396755 no she ripped me off for 120 bucks for these shitty smokes
2396756 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing
2396757 tonight that dream comes true may these olympic games bring you joy hope and pride
2396758 we cannot march as it goes on until very late
2396759 it would be like going out for a big night out two days before racing
2396760 they all give a damn and they want to find a way out of this nightmare
2396761 one of the stopping points was the whole felony charge
2396762 youre the mayor and a lawyer you cant have a felony thats the key
2396763 if the mayor wants to end this he knows what he has to do
2396764 there have been plenty of meetings among business leaders its at the top of the agenda lets face it these are business leaders invested in the city and they want it to reach its fruition
2396765 some say its stalled some say the spiral is going the other way
2396766 hes a friend and its hard when friends get in trouble when pete said hes the best mayor weve had in 24 years he meant it
2396767 liberals and conservatives blacks whites religious all trying and hoping we can get there
2396768 i know what they talked about most was how to get out of this the best way we can because right now no one is looking for a win win to use the old pr speak but everybody is trying to avoid a lose lose
2396769 lets be honest the city council stuff is going to take many months
2396770 we have a legal process that has already started and will kick into high gear next month its all everybody talks about

2396774 primarily crushing wounds trauma as what you would expect in a situation like this ill tell you there were very few walking wounded
2396775 i think it would be premature to jump out there and say what may have happened
2396776 lets go for 31 they have tried believe me the plays are just not there all opposing offenses have relied on going for the very short pass and that hasnt worked that well also roy williams is a very effective tackler and doesnt allow for many yards after the catch the addition of kevin burnett is key in nickel and dime situations also a very good and speedy linebacker who can cover but also can tackle the occasional screen or shovel pass
2396777 from what ive been told from the hotel the public security bureau showed up at midnight and told them our specific event had to be canceled for safety reasons without going into any specifics
2396778 when i arrived at 8 a m there were public security officials in the press conference room we had booked amanda didnt want her voice to be silenced so we went ahead and arranged something else we never knew if we were going to be stopped at any point
2396779 it was a sexy ad really designed for the u s market it was positive and it was supposed to be done in a private function room
2396780 im surprised they were so concerned given weve done similar with asian celebrities in the past
2396781 i have seen a lot of the videos and it brings me to tears
2396782 what some people think is pretty is actually something thats very gruesome and gross
2396783 if we have had charles woodson and kgb on the field we would have won the game
2396784 the individual has the right to claim control over his social accessibility during his private time as a sort of possession
2396785 one of the most common ways of denying a person that right is to buy it from him
2396786 well here is one dwarf she wont ensnare so easily i have the eyes of hawk and the ears of a fox
2396787 so far seven days and im here rocking the same white tee shirt and the same dodger hat and i didnt even know that we got manny

2396789 lo ideal para ellos es que los hijos se inicien sexualmente lo m s tarde posible y por este ideal muchas veces se niegan a la realidad de que sus ni os ya han tenido sus primeras experiencias
2396790 nadie espera que su hija de 16 a os est teniendo actividad sexual ya que lo mejor es que la deje para cuando se encuentre en condiciones de afrontar las consecuencias como puede ser un embarazo en el fondo que est madura emocionalmente y que no se vaya a arrepentir de lo que hizo en caso de que termine con el pololo
2396791 hay muchas mam s que hablan con las hijas pero de manera equivocada no es cierto mhijita que usted no est teniendo relaciones con su pololo les dicen as est n partiendo mal pues no logran que las hijas les conf en su secreto no hay que hablarles con ese lenguaje de negaci n ya que se les cierra la puerta
2396792 en la primera consulta ginecol gica uno las mide y las pesa si tienen 16 o 17 a os se les ofrece mirar el rea con un espejo lo que no involucra ning n examen interno
2396793 a veces las pacientes se coh ben porque es algo tab y piensan que las van a ver como morbosas pero se les explica por ejemplo c mo usar tampones eso les ayuda a entender m s y se les muestran los labios mayores los labios menores la entrada del himen el cl toris todo la idea es hacerlas sentir que es algo normal
2396794 i wouldnt recommend you read other gods before bedtime unless your significant other actually likes being woken up by you telling them you just read a scary story and cant sleep and did they hear that noise and why are they looking at you like that
2396795 it has been an eventful week with a lot of rumors and a lot of things that people come up with and i have no idea where its coming from
2396796 this defines where we are at and i am really excited about the opportunity that these guys gave me six years ago
2396797 all of a sudden the front end just started lightly sliding up the track and i tried to turn and it wouldnt turn
2396798 i wasnt able to put any steering in the front end of the car so i dont know
2396799 going back to the place where i just crashed a week ago is something i have never had to come across before on an oval
2396800 im sure we will get back up to speed pretty quick and ill gain my confidence back well push it to the limit and see what the mcdonalds car is capable of
2396801 live in harmony with each other dont be too proud to enjoy the company of ordinary people and dont think you know it all

2396809 es bien sabido que la importancia del personaje se agranda bajo la mano de su inmortal creador y que el don quijote de la segunda parte el amable interlocutor de duques y duquesas el sabio mentor de su escudero gobernador no es el mismo don quijote que aparece en la primera parte de la novela
2396810 la libertad sancho es uno de los m s preciados dones que a los hombres dieron los cielos con ella no pueden igualarse los tesoros que encierran la tierra ni el mar encubre por la libertad as como por la honra se puede y se debe aventurar la vida y por el contrario el cautiverio es el mayor mal que puede venir a los hombres
2396811 y acaso puede una persona fundar su felicidad sobre la desdicha de otra

2396842 iran would likely launch a crash program to quickly obtain nuclear weapons
2396843 an attack would likely leave iran angry more nationalistic fed up with international inspectors and nonproliferation treaties and more determined than ever to obtain nuclear weapons
2396844 hours after masud barzani president of the kurdistan region threatened to annex kirkuk in the event of the failure to reach agreement on the governorates elections law and saying the iraqi parliaments approval of the law
2396845 they came at night to steal fruit from the orchards and go back to gaza laden with loot we guarded the area of the kibbutz from them we would catch prisoners bring them back to the kibbutz and the army picked them up every morning and paid us inside the kibbutz there was a kind of jail a small tin shack where they would keep the prisoners until the army took them
2396846 iran would likely launch a crash program to quickly obtain nuclear weapons
2396847 an attack would likely leave iran angry more nationalistic fed up with international inspectors and nonproliferation treaties and more determined than ever to obtain nuclear weapons

2396849 the game opened with darwin missing a three then alhaji setting up maximus for a jump shot after a couple misses fede hit a jump shot and before you knew it the hawks were on an 8 0 run interestingly enough chocolate thunder failed to get a rebound in the first lots of strange things happened in this game not strangely fede went on a run in the opener scoring 13 in counter to that the opponents scored 18 points on very efficient shooting by their shooting guard this seems to be a consistent pattern and we need to work a little more on defense at that position despite having 3 steals we had no blocks and although we only missed two jumpers in the first we missed 5 3s tr hit a couple of jumpers max scored inside twice and alhaji hit the only shot he took inside the arc
2396850 this was set up to be mark bradtkes quarter he was set as star in the manager tactics and hero in his tactics we set it up to pass to him this period etc nope mark hit his only shot of the period played well with a couple of steals as the defense got tracked but that was it who went crazy chocolate thunder and alhaji choco scored 17 on 8 9 and a free throw dishing 7 and getting a measly two rebounds alhaji was back to his old tricks with 2 2 from inside the arc and 3 3 from behind the three point line with 4 assists max was also brilliant 4 4 with 6 rebounds and 3 assists he is going to be a good one guys
2396851 in the 4th we were looking for big dave in strategy settings and it actually performed as suspected kind of dave had 13 points on 6 7 6 boards 5 assists and 3 steals wow alhaji again came up big with 4 4 from the field and 1 1 for 3 also grabbing a steal max took a turn at being valdas adamkus by shooting 4 4 and getting 5 boards no blocks again this period center leads in assists for each period point guard leads in rebounding the hawks worked steadily through the quarter to maintain control of the game and make sure that darwin did not have even a mini run
2396852 its a plant it doesnt have the usual vital organs in the next few days a week at most this plants going to die and when it does itll collapse and shatter hurling its winged seeds everywhere if you look closely you might already see cracks in its bark
2396853 why not use our swords like axes and chop it down
2396854 its the hydras bark its inches thick and as hard as iron no normal blade easily penetrates that armor only weapons blessed by the gods threaten them
2396855 but thats not the worst part a dead hydras more dangerous than a live one each hydra carries thousands and thousands of seeds these fly everywhere especially in a strong wind and when next spring comes you have thousands of hydras instead of just one

2396881 war ja klar dass die frage sofort kommt nunja erstmal warte ich darauf dass beck verzichtet und die stones steinmeier und steinbr ck die red sich entschliessen die partei nun endg ltig richtung fdp zu verlassen um den weg f r f r unverbrauchte gesichter frei zu machen
2396882 nein da kann ich sie beruhigen diese zeiten sind vorbei als vorbildlicher sozialdemokrat habe ich von natur aus ein blasses antlitz das geh rt bei uns so zum guten ton man schl ft tags ber und nachts sorgt man f r neue koalitionsoptionen erst in ministerverantwortung erh lt man eine finca in der lombardei h tte ich jetzt noch knallhart eitrige krampfadern und eine frau die ich in oggersheim vereinsamen lassen w rde dann w re ich wohl in der union also h ren sie auf mit ihren fadenscheinigen moralgetue

2396884 links und rechts ber und unter der spd darf es keine politische kraft geben
2396885 in dieser runde kann ich es ja offen zugeben der w hler will verarscht werden wie k nnen sonst 14 jahre adenauer oder gruselige 16 jahre kohl zustande kommen f r die spd gilt dasselbe da k rzen wir der ganzen unterschicht die sozialgelder untern m arsch zusammen agenda 2010 die red und was passiert die w hler w hlen so eine gesichtsgel hmte die wenn sie so k nnte wie sie wollte noch mehr gelder streichen w rde deswegen pl diere ich f r einen kontrollierten sozialabbau der extremst groovig und geschmeidig passiert so dass die leute es gar nicht merken werden

2396890 nein mit sicherheit nicht ich mag amerika aber so ein kadavergehorsames verhalten wie es seinerzeit herr angela merkel an den tag legte indem sie kanzler schr der in amerka in schlechtes licht stellte wird es unter meiner f hrung nicht geben wissen sie neulich als mein freund barak f r eine kurze zeit in berlin weilte haben wir uns auch dar ber unterhalten neben schon fast altehrw rdigen sauf und bumsgeschichten die wir uns protzend vor die f sse warfen war der nahe osten ein gro es thema schlussendlich sind wir zu der gemeinsamen auffassung gelangt dass weitere milit rische anstrengungen in weiteren staaten im moment schlicht unm glich sind so langsam haben die usa den irak materiell soweit ausgesaugt und kulturell entfremdet dass man sich g nzlich afghanistan zuwenden kann das wird schon anstrengend genug

2397154 the greatest good we can do our country is to heal its party visions and make them one people
2397155 for months weve seen average americans weighing in on this issue and its plain the throw the bums out sentiment is spreading
2397156 you dont have to be a political analyst to understand whats happening the prevailing ill will is going to drop politics on its head frankly it wont be at all surprising to see americans turn their backs on dc insiders when they choose their next president and members of congress
2397157 the public seems to be concentrating its wrath on the gop
2397158 the constitution partys been welcoming an influx of voters who had been fiercely loyal to the gop democrats as well cannot stomach the betrayal anymore on issues like illegal immigration presidential power grabs endless unconstitutional wars and loss of american jobs its safe to say were witnessing major defections from both of the establishment parties
2397159 gutsy article on science students still avoids problem of anti religious prejudice

2397162 we can draw lessons from the past but we cannot live in it

2397164 if you limit your choices only to what seems possible or reasonable you disconnect yourself from what you truly want and all that is left is a compromise

2397178 andy i do you do you think that dantes hell is existential
2397179 existential according to dante every one of the nine circles of hell is tailored to a particular sin and each person within each circle has a specific vision of punishment depending upon the details of how he or she committed that sin so what if all of the sinners refuse to feel guilty for what they have done and thus refuses to visualise a punishment will hell cease to exist even if they do visualise their sins the power of the mind has its limits longing for something or dreading it wont necessarily make it occur i mean the floor wont open up and swallow you just because you really want it to right
2397180 no well maybe but i was going to say smart youre very smart has anyone ever told you that
2397181 no not til now i mean thanks i i should probably go
2397182 but juliet says that lisa found a pair of rachaels underwear jill are you crying
2397183 oh honey you didnt want him to sleep with you did you
2397184 no i just i want to be the last person he talks to before he goes to bed at night
2397185 dont tell me im pretty dont you dare tell me that
2397186 i wasnt going to i was just going to say that i love you very much
2397187 no one can ever really relate to how you feel
2397188 im here for you youre here for me lets sing
2397189 i dont write about my life like hopping onto a train at 9 am bla bla like you as in me endoru my blog is to inspire people
2397190 you see in life you will make all sorts of friends ive got a friend who came up to me and asked me to lend him some money i asked him how much he needed and he said a big sum i told him ive got a family to take care also but as a friend i could only lend him the certain amount of money i could at that time i lent him the money and till today he hasnt pay me back so what must i do go to him and ask him to pay me back no i wont do so why you see if he has the money or still remembers me as a kind friend he would come back and return it to me for my good deed since he hasnt that means he has no money or he had just cheated my money off just for the sake of the term friendship but i tell you what i knew that the moment i gave him the money i am giving up the money not to say that i dont trust him but it is like investment when you hand out the money you can think that it is no longer yours so be wise to think that selflessness is to be done without expecting for a return selfishness is not good but you have to see whether you have space in your heart to be selfless be good to others and others may be good to you if thats so that would be jolly good and we should be thankful for it but never get too disappointed when they dont or even betray you your deed is noted somehow and fate will repay you somehow in the future in a different way in those just trust in that fate when you want to be kind
2397191 one of the most important times in your life a time of endings and new beginnings
2397192 the quality of the entire experience and the extent to which it is felt to be a difficult time depends entirely on how one has lived during the previous twenty nine years
2397193 consciously or unconsciously you are pruning your life of everything that is not relevant to what you really are as a human being
2397194 saturn is never easy to deal with because his function is that of promoting growth
2397195 and it is only frustration and pain which at present are sufficient goads to get a human being moving
2397196 i could very well be wrong and thank god for grace
2397197 the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god has come near repent and and believe in the good news
2397198 to you is born this day in the city of david a saviour who is the messiah the lord
2397199 and this good news gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world as a testimony of the nations and then the end will come

2397204 weve had our share of things going on but nothing like this
2397205 i have known the lost souls who haunt this world searching for life in all the wrongs places i was one of them so many wondrous people lose their purity to exploitation and hang a price tag on their bodies and souls these are the subjects who populate my works
2397206 the artist grew up in a loving home and began creating at a young age

2397209 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2397210 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2397211 on the night of 8 august 2008 sorrow death and destruction came down upon the earth we saw numerous innocent civilian victims we saw the destruction of populated areas and the infrastructure of south ossetia stop this immediately do not spill any more blood do not enlarge the present conflict
2397212 to use warfare and fighting this is in contradiction to the christian principles of peaceful coexistence
2397213 our church is ready to combine efforts with those of the georgian church to make a serious effort at peacemaking i think that if we turn to the peaceful spirit of the gospel listening to the voices of the wise pastors of the church of the two wise first hierarchs of two local churches his holiness patriarch aleksei and his holiness patriarch ilya it will help us to turn away from conflict and bloodshed so that it does not spread into other regions we know how dangerous the spread of international conflicts can be we know that the world wars began because of the escalation of local conflicts therefore today it is very important in the light of our common christian heritage to reflect on the fact that the majority of ossetians and virtually all georgians are orthodox christians we should sit down at the negotiation table to thrash out our differences to stop the bloodshed and to ensure that the feelings of all sides would be respected and all sides would feel safe living together
2397214 at present 22 45 mst 18 45 gmt 14 45 edt the entire city of tskhinvali is under the control of the defence forces of the republic of south ossetia now the georgian forces are attempting to break through in the southern suburbs of tskhinvali as a result combat is taking place
2397215 at present south ossetian forces have established control over the largest part of the city and the georgian forces control only pockets in the southern outskirts of the city
2397216 we shall not retreat we shall continue to carry out the tasks that are entrusted to us
2397217 for the last two hours the situation in tskhinvali has been relatively calm
2397218 at present both sides are tensely awaiting the resumption of combat no one hides this fact the georgian side is regrouping whilst the ossetian side is preparing to repulse another attack
2397219 now there is an ominous silence above the city the skirmishes have ceased the city is entirely cleared of georgian military units
2397220 tskhinvali is completely in the hands of georgian troops moreover we control all populated areas in south ossetia except dzhavy and the rokskim tunnel
2397221 the president of georgia is constantly ringing up world leaders and is expressing his anxiety over the situation this is a patriotic war for georgia and we shall not yield even one handful of our soil this is not a conflict over the tskhinvali region it is a patriotic war against russia
2397222 the intensity of the bombardment from all forms of artillery is almost as heavy as yesterday
2397223 at present georgian artillery is firing on the residential areas of tskhinvali it is being accomplished by heavy artillery practically the entire city is coming under fire
2397224 rumblings out of panthers camp that club officials are fed up with smiths actions not just the latest incident and are at least considering the idea of dealing him to another team

2397229 its a very special place for me its where ive spent the happiest nights of my life
2397230 look at all those fireworks i bet it took thoooouusands of chinese children to make them
2397231 hemos estado ensayando estos ltimos d as pero llev bamos tiempo sin ver al equipo y al manager de la gira as que todos nos tomamos unas copas anoche
2397232 v esa mal sima pel cula en la que sale mark wahlberg
2397233 c mo se llama ah s rock star no pod a dormir y eran m s o menos las dos de la ma ana era tan mala que tuve que verla hasta el final s lo por lo irrisorio hace un papel tan estereot pico hay una escena en la que toca su primer concierto y su mujer se despierta en la cama con dos tipos y l entra en el sal n y hay mujeres desnudas por todas partes eso no pasa colega
2397234 creo que pasamos por nuestro periodo de desmadre con los primeros discos esa especie de transici n entre estar en teignmouth todo el tiempo en el paro y de repente tener algo de dinero y estar de gira constantemente creo que perdimos un poco el control no de forma negativa sobre todo en la poca de origin of symmetry definitivamente hubo muchas fiestas desenfrenadas mucho alcohol y ese tipo de cosas
2397235 bueno so desde el lanzamiento de showbiz pero en realidad llevamos desde 1994 sorprendente la verdad hemos tenido xito hasta ahora llevamos una buena racha
2397236 no parece tan lejano cuando tocamos ante 30 personas en el cavern club en exeter
2397237 fue hace 10 12 a os pero no parece tanto tiempo en absoluto de gira la vida pasa tan r pido
2397238 tenemos un estudio cerca del lago de como y hemos estado ensayando y trabajando en material nuevo es un lugar fant stico para comenzar con todo el proceso creativo del lbum es tan bonito ya sabes te metes en un estudio bastante oscuro en un s tano y luego sales entre tomas y ves el lago y las monta as respiras hondo aire fresco y te relajas
2397239 en realidad no porque siempre estamos juntos quiero decir nos separamos unas semanas ocasionalmente pero si miras el porcentaje de tiempo en que estamos juntos al a o es probablemente el 90 as que unas pocas semanas aqu y all est bien y estar desperdigados no es problema cuanto m s viajas m s peque o se te hace el mundo coger un avi n para italia es como ir en coche hasta devon as que es genial no hay problemas con la distancia ni creativos ni de ning n tipo
2397240 son momentos apasionantes la verdad volvemos a meternos en harina te implicas mucho en el lado creativo de las cosas tocas instrumentos extra os y otras cosas que normalmente no est n a tu alcance y luego te vas de gira dos a os y se te olvida todo as que est bien volver al estudio
2397241 son cosas radicalmente diferentes desde luego y en cada una tienes sensaciones distintas pero son igualmente importantes necesitas crear para que tu mente y la banda sigan adelante y desde luego so tiene que pasar pero te sientes tan realizado tocando esas canciones por todo el mundo en pa ses diferentes y ante gente distinta es incre ble as que ambas cosas son igual de importantes no tengo preferencias en realidad
2397242 somos afortunados como banda en cuanto a que a todos nos gusta ir de gira
2397243 conocemos a muchas bandas que simplemente no pueden con ello o no quieren bueno pero a nosotros nos encanta ahora seguimos de gira m s o menos bueno no mucho pero est bien hacer alguna cosilla en vez de hibernar durante un a o
2397244 para nosotros todo eso era bastante cre ble por los menos para m parec a que hab a muchos asuntos delicados acerca de la manera en que la actual zona cero la manera en que se cayeron los edificios y la rapidez con que lo hicieron y c mo los otros edificios tambi n acabaron cayendo por no decir de cuando se estrellaron aquellos aviones en pennsylvania y el pent gono
2397245 que es todo mentira s lo tienes que verlo para darte cuenta de que todo es una broma es tan siniestro que am rica enga ara de esa forma a la opini n p blica pero supongo que mucha gente se lo crey estaban en un momento vulnerable as que estaban expuestos a creerse cualquier cosa as es perverso
2397246 bueno del 11s no mucho so fue s lo una cosa que ocurri hace muchos a os pero claro que hablamos de todo tipo de cosas est s con tus amigos y hablas no
2397247 no creo que tengas la responsabilidad de hablar de asuntos pol ticos ni nada s que algunos m sicos lo hacen pero si est s en una banda o si eres artista tienes una especie de plataforma que te permite decir p blico lo que piensas de cualquier cosa y si te interesa la pol tica sta puede reflejarse en tu m sica o en c mo hablas pero lo cierto es que nosotros no asumimos esa responsabilidad creo que s lo hemos hablado alguna vez de cosas que nos parec an relevantes en nuestra m sica o en c mo nos sent amos y estoy seguro de que hemos hablado de un mont n de cosas est pidas y rid culas en el pasado jajaj
2397248 en estos momentos todo parece muy abierto se est n abriendo muchas puertas hay nuevas ideas en cuanto a c mo presentar los trabajos aparte del formato tradicional del cd
2397249 pero no estamos en contra de lanzar discos como un grupo de canciones juntas en absoluto si hay un motivo para que est n juntas entonces tendr n que estar juntas si las canciones van hiladas o si es una pieza conceptual o simplemente suenan bien juntas entonces deber as sacarlas juntas creo que el tema est muy abierto quiero decir que todav a no hemos decidido qu vamos a hacer exactamente la m sica es la que dictar el formato pero creo que est claro que la manera tradicional de sacar discos a trav s de compa as discogr ficas ha terminado debe terminar porque est n todas sin blanca jajaj
2397250 definitivamente hay un elemento de libertad para los artistas hoy d a lo cual est muy bien por supuesto que es m s f cil para las bandas ya establecidas que tienen una legi n de fans pero son buenos tiempos no creo que sea el fin de la industria musical se est n abriendo las puertas a una mayor libertad creativa en el mundo de la m sica
2397251 todav a no creo que entre los tres tenemos todav a una sana ambici n de descubrir m s crear m s m sica evolucionar y cambiar probar cosas y mejorar en lo que hacemos as que tenemos muchas aspiraciones la verdad parece un momento muy positivo hay un mont n de cosas que queremos conseguir como una gira mundial de estadios hasta que consigamos so jajaja
2397252 algunas cosas se te escapan y se usan sin tu consentimiento siempre hemos trazado la l nea en los productos de supermercado en cualquier cosa que puedes comprar en una tienda de ese tipo ya sabes no tiene nada que ver con la m sica nescaf us nuestra canci n feeling good una vez les denunciamos nos indemnizaron y dimos el dinero a oxfam ese tipo de cosas definitivamente degrada tu m sica obviamente depende de lo que sea

2397256 no recuerdo cu les eran probablemente eran aburrid simos creo que una vez me imagin siendo un monitor de submarinismo ya sabes irte a vivir al sol por una temporada
2397257 s as que probablemente le ha dado demasiada importancia acaba de terminar los masters y todo eso pero ahora se est especializando en sexolog a y so es bueno so es todo lo que deber a decir jajaj
2397258 pol tica italiana ver s no le presto mucha atenci n todos por all no parecen tom rselo muy en serio lo consideran todo muy corrupto y eso creo que todos tienen sus propios gobiernos locales y su propia manera de tratar las cosas
2397259 jajaj no estoy seguro de so pero lo cierto es que me he cruzado con unos cuantos sospechosos de los que podr as decir que podr an estar en ese mundo pero digamos que en las conversaciones cotidianas la pol tica no est tan presente como en am rica donde absolutamente todo el mundo est obsesionado con las elecciones
2397260 hay tres bandos supongo est el bando anti conspiraci n que son los que simplemente no contemplan nada que sugiera que la gente en el poder pudiera hacer algo contra su propia gente luego el otro bando en cuanto al 11s es el de aquellos que creen que no lo provocaron pero que permitieron que ocurriera y luego est el tercer bando el de los que dicen que realmente lo provocaron
2397261 probablemente en el segundo desde luego creo que hay una sensaci n de que en parte sab an lo que iba a pasar pero entendieron que va a sonar terrible podr a haber buenos motivos para dejar que ocurriera por desgracia hay algo de so muchos debaten sobre pearl harbour por las mismas razones
2397262 c mo puedes prohibir la naturaleza c mo podemos hacer ilegal a la naturaleza
2397263 bueno dir a m s bien que no hemos hecho nada serio todav a pero s demos mayormente y cosillas a ver c mo funcionan ya sabes luego vuelves y las cambias y as dejas que se desarrollen lo cual es raro en nosotros pero la cosa va bien tenemos unas cuantas canciones buenas definitivamente hay un elemento u2 por ah de los primeros u2 puedo reconocer algo de so por ah tenemos una canci n que suena un poco a new years day
2397264 no en la secci n de ritmo los primeros trabajos de u2 ten an unos ritmos minimalistas realmente buenos ya sabes guitarras simples bajo y bater a no demasiados platillos m s a reos y caja es lo que queremos definitivamente un poco m s b sico m s desnudo
2397265 qu m s tenemos ah s un poco de glam rock tambi n algo en la l nea de marc bolan un poco c mico la verdad creo que podemos hacer algo as en este momento
2397266 jaja creo que todav a lo hacemos pero espero que estemos un poco m s calmados y recogidos cuando hagamos una lista de canciones para el lbum hemos hecho ciertas cosas y llegado muy lejos para poner a prueba nuestro registro pero ahora nos gustar a hacer unas cuantas canciones buenas de verdad
2397267 hemos hecho algo de eso en el pasado pero lo cierto es que muchas de nuestras canciones no funcionan as pero esta vez s que hay algunas canciones que van en esa l nea sencilla de tocarlas en el piano o en la guitarra aunque otras que hemos hecho no funcionar an en ac stico ciertamente
2397268 su poca fueron los ltimos a os 50 y los primeros 60 cuando yo era peque o todav a tocaba en peque as sesiones aqu y all peque os conciertos en pubs y cosas as pero no estaba en una gran banda ni nada de eso en aquel momento ya se hab a retirado de las giras
2397269 supongo que crec pensando que estar en una banda no era algo necesariamente inusual eso fue el principal impacto y ser un m sico de cierto xito tampoco me parec a inusual as que me di un poco de confianza supongo aunque su m sica no supuso ninguna influencia al principio puede que en el ltimo disco en knights of cydonia ha sido la primera vez que he tocado algo as como un homenaje a ese estilo de los a os 50
2397270 s s le gusta mucho y desde luego nos ha aconsejado sobre c mo seguir juntos
2397271 tenemos un mont n de dinero y no lo necesitamos
2397272 creo que es el otro nico concierto que haremos este a o que es nuestro propiamente dicho y no un festival as que tengo muchas ganas por esa raz n probaremos algunas cosas diferentes en nuestro set y con un poco de suerte tocaremos una o dos canciones nuevas tambi n
2397273 s es dif cil siempre lo ha sido aunque te acostumbras este a o ha estado muy bien en cambio porque terminamos la gira a finales de noviembre en nueva zelanda y aparte de so creo que lo m s que he estado lejos de casa han sido cinco d as
2397274 he barajado la idea de mudarnos a londres varias veces pero a no ser que aproveches lo que londres tiene que ofrecer no hay motivo para irse all realmente de todas formas cuando tienes mujer e hijos el 95 del tiempo est s sentado viendo eastenders podr as hacer so en cualquier parte y la verdad prefiero hacerlo en devon es un bonito sitio del pa s para criar a tus hijos
2397275 un poco s a veces es bastante curioso pero creo que durante un tiempo fue algo importante para mucha gente pero como he estado en casa tanto tiempo durante los seis ltimos meses ya no supone gran cosa me han visto entrar y salir del bar ir a comer y esas cosas
2397276 no s si es por el tipo de banda que somos o qu
2397277 me encant vuestro primer disco pero odio todo lo que hab is hecho desde entonces
2397278 matt escribe las canciones y es el que viene con las ideas unas cosas m s desarrolladas que otras a veces creo que gran parte de cada lbum se ha hecho con canciones que matt sab a muy bien por d nde ten an que ir antes de o rlas siquiera yo y dom pero en lo restante matt llega con unos arreglos b sicos e ideas sueltas sobre qu direcci n tomar todo est muy abierto a sugerencias y a opiniones individuales lo que quiero decir es que en gran parte de lo que hemos estado haciendo recientemente matt nos ha venido con una estructura muy b sica pero ciertas cosas que hacemos bien yo o dom pueden a menudo cambiar dr sticamente la direcci n que toma una canci n pero obviamente todos tenemos que estar contentos con ello lo hacemos democr ticamente puede haber una canci n que a mi y a dom nos encante pero a matt no tanto y no es justo poner a nadie en la tesitura de tener que ir de gira durante tres a os y tener que tocar una canci n que no le guste
2397279 de momento s lo estamos componiendo as que vamos un poco por nuestra cuenta tenemos un ingeniero que viene y nos dice c mo tiene que funcionar todo aparte de eso nos deja solos no sabemos muy bien qu hacer rich es un tipo genial y hemos hecho dos discos con l as que obviamente nos sentimos c modos con l pero podr a ser el momento de hacer algo nuevo tambi n creo que se pueden hacer tantas cosas trabajando siempre con la misma persona sin sonar igual porque claro est cada persona tiene unas caracter sticas que siempre salen a relucir as que no estoy diciendo que no vayamos a trabajar con l por ahora prefiero ir a mi rollo en el estudio con un ingeniero y ver qu pasa podr a ser una mierda

2397287 aku bermimpi ada sebuah dusun yang amat luas lagi indah di sana kulihat ada sepohon kayu yand rendanng dan lebat buahnya tiba tiba di situ keluar seekor khinzir dari hujung sebuah kampung lalu habis dimakannya buah buahan yang masak ranum dari pokok itu hingga ke daun dan dahan dahannya habis ditutuh yang tinggal cuma batangnya sahaja dalam pada itu juga keluar seekor harimau daripada umbi pohon rendang tadi lalu menerkam khinzir itu dengan gigi dan kukunya yang tajam lalu khinzir tadi mati disitu juga
2397288 apa yang tuan lihat dalam mimpi tuan sebagai dusun yang luas lagi indah itu adalah tamsilan kepada agama islam kita
2397289 tiba tiba suara abu hanifah memeranjatkan dahri dan menyentakkan kaum muslimin yang hadir
2397290 allah telah meninggikan darjat orang beriman dan berimul antara kamu beberapa darjat
2397291 hairan kau kata allah itu wujud tetapi tidak bertempat pula
2397292 bahkan memang aku ada nyawa dan memang setiap makhluk yang bernafas itu ada nyawa
2397293 tetapi adakah kau tahu di manakah letaknya nyawa atau rohmu itu dikepalakah diperutkah atau adakah dihujung tapak kakimu
2397294 kalau begitu dimanakah lemak itu berada di bahagian atasnyakah atau dibawahkah
2397295 untuk mencari dimanakah beradanya roh dalam jasad dan tersisip dimanakah kandungan lemak dalam air susu ini pun kita tidak upaya masakan pula kita dapat menjangkau dimanakah beradanya zat allah swt di alam maya ini zat yang telah mencipta dan mentadbir seluruh alam ini termasuk rohdan akal dangkal kita ini pun ciptaan nya yang tunduk dan patuh di bawah urusan tadbir kerajaan nya yang maha agung
2397296 wahai dahri tidak ada suatu pun yang wujud sebelum allah taala dan tidak ada sesuatu jua yang akan muncul selepas nya allah swt tetap qadim dan azali dialah yanng awal dan dialah yang akhir
2397297 pelik sungguh mana mungkin begitu tuhan wujud tanpa ada permulaan nya dan mana mungkin dia pula yang terakhir tanpa ada lagi yang selepas nya
2397298 ya dalilnya ada pada diri kamusendiri cuba kau lihat pada ibu jari mu itu jari apakah yang kau nampak berada sebelum jari ini

2397301 ini soalan yang sungguh menarik jadi kenalah dijawab dari tempat yang tinggi supaya dapat didengar oleh semua orang
2397302 wahai sekelian manusia ketahuilah bahawa kerja allah ketika ini ialah menggugurkan yang bathil sebagaimana dahri yang berada di atas mimbar diturunkan allah ke bawah mimbar dan allah juga telah menaikkan yang hak sebagaimana aku yang berada di sana telah dinaikkan ke atas mimbar masjid jamek ini

2397305 when a man is provided the ability tawfiq of good deeds or he keeps on performing good deeds you may conclude that allah tala is satisfied with him therefore getting the opportunity of good deeds and performing ibadat i e worshipping of allah tala is to be thought great bounty
2397306 concentrating mind on a good deed is within the ability of man but to contact mind and soul in ibadat worship toward allah tala is not within the ability of man that is the wish of allah tala
2397307 dont leave a good deed despite of being small and refrain from committing a sin despite how minor it seems
2397308 the enormous good deeds those you perform today are the successors of small good deeds you performed at the earlier stage of your life gradually from small good deeds opportunity of performing greater amount of good deeds has come similarly those who are committing major sins today previously had been habituated to minor ones
2397309 we shouldnt leave performing good deeds assuming it to be small because often that becomes the reason for salvation for example the two incidents of two mudares teachers of deoband madrasah one between them is mawlana mahmudul hasan r whom one saw in dream after passing away and asked how has allah tala treated you he answered when alive once his wife cooked curry without salt and he didnt utter any single word regarding the matter to his wife and simply had his meal allah tala for such a petty deed had forgiven him and set free

2397392 i think it can be said from this discussion that there is at present somewhat more accommodation on the islamic side for the founder of christianity than there is on the christian side for the founder of islam what the significance of that is we leave it to you the viewer to determine but i do think you will agree that it is a good thing that we are talking together
2397393 and nearest among them in love to the believers wilt thou find those who say we are christians because among these are men devoted to learning and men who have renounced the world and they are not arrogant
2397394 we muslims believe that jesus was one of the mightiest messengers of god that he was the christ that he was born miraculously without any male intervention which many modern day christians do not believe today that he gave life to the dead by gods permission and that he healed those born blind and the lepers by gods permission in fact no muslim is a muslim if he or she does not believe in jesus
2397395 the lies which well meaning zeal has heaped round this man muhammed are disgraceful to ourselves only
2397396 seek ye the truth and the truth shall set you free
2397397 we gave jesus the son of mary clear signs and strengthened him with the holy spirit
2397398 christ jesus the son of mary was no more than an apostle of god
2397399 and in their foot steps we sent jesus the son of mary
2397400 and zakariya and john and jesus and elias all in the ranks of the righteous
2397401 behold the angels said o mary god hath chosen thee and purified thee and chosen thee above the women of all nations
2397402 o mary worship thy lord devoutly prostrate thyself and bow down in prayer with those who bow down
2397403 this is part of the tidings of the things unseen which we reveal unto thee o muhammad by inspiration thou wast not with them when they cast lots with arrows as to which of them should be charged with the care of mary nor wast thou with them when they disputed the point
2397404 this is muhammeds own concoction he copied his revelations from the jews and christians he plagiarized it he forged it
2397405 have you any qualms in agreeing that muhammed was an arab
2397406 that this arab in the first instance was addressing other arabs he was not talking to indian muslims chinese muslims or nigerian muslims he was addressing his own people the arabs whether they agreed with him or not he told them in the most sublime form words that were seared into the hearts and minds of his listeners that mary the mother of jesus a jewess was chosen above the women of all nations not his own mother nor his wife nor his daughter nor any other arab woman but a jewess can one explain this because to everyone his own mother or wife or daughters would come before other women why would the prophet of islam honor a woman from his opposition and a jewess at that belonging to a race which had been looking down upon his people for three thousand years just as they still look down upon their arab brethren today
2397407 it is no less than an inspiration sent down to him
2397408 behold the angels said o mary allah giveth thee glad tidings of a word from him his name will be jesus the son of mary held in honor in this world and the hereafter and of the company of those nearest to allah
2397409 i am the god of bethel where you anointed a pillar
2397410 and moses anointed the tabernacle and all things that was therein
2397411 he shall speak to the people in childhood and in maturity and he shall be of the company of the righteous
2397412 at length she brought the babe to her people carrying him
2397413 the amazement of the people knew no bounds in any case they were prepared to think the worst of her as she had disappeared from her kin for some time but now she comes shamelessly parading a babe in her arms how she had disgraced house of aaron the fountain of priesthood
2397414 but she pointed to the babe they said how can we talk one who is a child in the cradle he jesus said i am indeed a servant of allah god he hath given me revelation and made me a prophet and he hath made me blessed wheresoever i be and hath enjoined on me prayer and charity as long as i live he hath made me kind to my mother and not overbearing or unblest so peace is on me the day i was born the day that i die and the day that i shall be raised up to life again
2397415 and the third day there was a marriage in cana of galilee and the mother of jesus was there and both jesus was called and his disciples to the marriage and when they wanted wine the mother of jesus saith unto him they have no wine jesus saith unto her woman what have i to do with thee mine hour is not yet come his mother saith unto the servants whatsoever he saith unto you do it and there were set there six water pots of stone after the manner of the purifying of the jews containing two or three firkins apiece jesus saith unto them fill the water pots with water and they filled them up to the brim and he saith unto them draw out now and bear unto the governor of the feast and they bare it when the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine and knew not whence it was but the servants which drew the water knew the governor of the feast called the bridegroom and saith unto him every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine and when men have well drunk then that which is worse but thou hast kept the good wine until now
2397416 have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now
2397417 he was led to the slaughter like a lamb and like a sheep who before his shearer is dumb he opened not his mouth
2397418 and he god almighty hath made me jesus kind to my mother and not overbearing or unblest
2397419 she said o my lord how shall i have a son when no man hath touched me
2397420 he said even so allah god createth what he willeth when he hath decreed a matter he but sayth o it be and it is and allah god will teach him the book and wisdom the torah law and the gospel
2397421 now the birth of jesus christ was in this wise when as his mother mary was espoused to joseph before they came together as husband and wife she was found with child of the holy ghost
2397422 how shall this be seeing i know not a man
2397423 she said o my lord how shall i have a son when no man hath touched me
2397424 and the angle answered and said into her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee
2397425 he said the angel says in reply even so allah god createth what he willeth when he hath decreed a plan he but saith to it be and it is
2397426 between these two versions of the birth of jesus the quranic version and the biblical version which would you prefer to give your daughter
2397427 the similitude of jesus before allah god is that of adam he created him from dust then said to him be and he was
2397428 after a description of the high position which jesus occupies as a prophet in the preceding verses we have a repudiation of the dogma that he was god or the son of god or any thing more than man if it is said that he was born without a human father adam was also so born indeed adam was born without either a human father or mother as far as our physical bodies are concerned they are mere dust in gods sight jesus was as dust just as adam was or humanity is the greatness of jesus arose from the divine command be for after that he was more than dust a great spiritual leader and teacher
2397429 for this melchisedec king of salem priest of the most high god without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life
2397430 the bigger the lie the more likely it is to be believed
2397431 seeing they see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand
2397432 deaf dumb and blind will they not return to the path
2397433 that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men and they bare children to them
2397434 for i god am a father to israel and ephraim is my firstborn
2397435 the lord hath said unto me david thou art my son this day have i begotten thee
2397436 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god
2397437 i am only trying to explain the meaning i do not believe that god really sired a son
2397438 that he was the son of a woman mary and therefore a man
2397439 but a messenger a man with a mission from allah god and therefore entitled to honor
2397440 a word bestowed on mary for he was created by allahs word be and he was
2397441 never said i to them aught except what thou didst command me to say to wit worship allah my lord and your lord
2397442 you see what you have quoted is the text i want to know the context the text that goes with it before or after
2397443 that which you have quoted is the text of john chapter 10 verse 30 to get at the context we have to begin from verse 23 which reads
2397444 and jesus was in the temple area walking in solomons colonnade
2397445 jesus answered i did tell you but you do not believe the miracles i do in my fathers name speak for me
2397446 but you do not believe because you are not my sheep
2397447 my sheep listen to my voice i know them and they follow me
2397448 i give them eternal life and they shall never perish no one can snatch them out of my hand
2397449 my father who has given them to me is greater than all no one can snatch them out of my fathers hand
2397450 i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one
2397451 but jesus said to them i have shown you many great miracles from the father for which of these do you stone me
2397452 the jews answered him saying for a good work we stone thee not but for blasphemy and because that thou being a man makest thyself a god
2397453 jesus answered them is it not written in your law i have said you are gods
2397454 if he called them gods to whom the word of god came and the scripture cannot be broken
2397455 what about the one whom the father set apart as his very own and sent into the world why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because i said i am gods son
2397456 think not that i am come to destroy the law of the prophets i am come not to destroy but to fulfill the law for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass away one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled
2397457 i have said ye are gods and all of you are the children of the most high
2397458 if good men holy men prophets of god are being addressed as gods in our books of authority with which you find no fault then why do you take exception to me when the only claim i make for myself is far inferior in our language viz a son of god as against others being called gods by god himself even if i jesus described myself as god in our language according to hebrew usage you could find no fault with me
2397459 where does jesus say i am god or i am equal to god or worship me
2397460 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god
2397461 but in 2 corinthians 4 4 you have dishonestly reversed your system by using a small g when spelling god
2397462 if paul was inspired to write hotheos the god for the devil why dont you use that capital g
2397463 why do you use a small g for god when referring to moses instead of a capital g as you do for a mere word word
2397464 why do you do this why do you play fast and loose with the word of god
2397465 i know but i am talking about the vested interests of christianity who are hell bent to deify christ by using capital letters here and small letters there to deceive the unwary masses who think that every letter every comma and full stop and the capital and small letters were dictated by god capital g here
2397466 muhammed salla allah u alihi wa sallam the natural successor to christ
2397467 and behold one came and said unto him good master what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life and he said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is god but if thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments
2397468 for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect
2397469 verily i say unto you among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than john the baptist
2397470 it was god working miracles through his prophets but jesus performed them of his own power
2397471 all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth
2397472 i cast out devils by the spirit of god then the kingdom of god is come unto you
2397473 even now if ye have faith ye shall see the glory of god
2397474 father i thank thee that thou hast heard me and i knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people which stand by i said it that they may believe that thou hast sent me
2397475 ye men of israel hear these words jesus of nazareth a man approved of god among you by miracles and wonders and signs which god did by him in the midst of you as ye yourselves also know
2397476 and among them are some who have faith but most of them are perverted transgressors
2397477 the cultural survival of more than 13 indigenous nations is directly intertwined with the environmental integrity of the holy san francisco peaks
2397478 todays decision not only places these ways of life in peril but sets the stage for an ecological and public health catastrophe we have no choice but to uphold our commitment to protect the holy san francisco peaks
2397479 only effect of the proposed upgrades is on the plaintiffs subjective emotional religious experience that is the presence of recycled wastewater on the peaks is offensive to the plaintiffs religious sensibilities the diminishment of spiritual fulfillment serious though it may be is not a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion
2397480 the court places itself in the position of judging the legitimacy of native american beliefs and practices it becomes the arbiter of religion which is not the proper role for the courts the evidence clearly shows that the peaks are important to 13 of the tribes in the southwestern united states and that using sewer water to make snow on them constitutes a significant burden on the tribes ability to practice their religion
2397481 in this country native americans have no first amendment rights when it comes to government land use decisions
2397482 the federal government likely holds thousands of acres of land that tribes hold sacred this case was the last best chance for the tribes to be able to provide some legal protection to those lands in a nation that prides itself on religious liberty it is unconscionable that native american beliefs are not respected under the law or the constitution we anticipate petitioning the u s supreme court for review of this matter
2397483 this ruling sets a negative precedent that impacts the future of native american religious practice
2397484 religious exercise invariably and centrally involves a subjective spiritual experience
2397485 the majoritys misunderstanding of the nature of religious beliefs and exercise as merely
2397486 rfra was passed to protect the exercise of all religions including the religions of american indians if indians land based exercise of religion is not protected by rfra in this case i cannot imagine a case in which it will be i am truly sorry that the majority has effectively read american indians out of rfra
2397487 this decision is a painful affirmation of the lack of protection for our religious freedom
2397488 it is a bitter reminder that not all citizens are equal in this country but just as the civil rights movement did not give up when courts delivered blow after blow we will not give up until our rights are fully upheld we the youth will continue to stand up for our cultural survival
2397489 federal land management policies are inconsistent when addressing native american religious practice relating to sacred places this case underscores the fact that we need legislative action to guarantee protection for places held holy by native american tribes
2397490 the deeply held religious beliefs of hundreds of thousands of citizens of this country have been trumped by a single for profit private business operating on public lands
2397491 eight of eleven judges decided to completely ignore the issue of what happens if a child were to eat this snow
2397492 the court dismissed the whole health issue on a procedural error thereby refusing to comment on the true health impacts of this fake snow which has been proven to contain harmful pharmaceuticals and personal care productions on our children the court has obviously cast off this responsibility and we will continue to demand accountability for our children and the land
2397493 we obviously disagree with ruling snowmaking with sewage is still plainly a bad idea
2397494 well keep fighting along side our partners this ruling only emboldens our resolve
2397495 i mean every pitch i saw today was a strike
2397496 he didnt throw me one ball i didnt see one ball today every pitch i saw was a strike
2397497 just late last night in my room just thinking about what i wanted to do with him
2397498 if he throws me three in there im not going to hit it anyway listen you cant prepare i mean you can go up there with a plan go up there with an idea of what you want but if hes throwing 96 where he wants to youre done
2397499 and here harris went silent and mimed the removal of his cap
2397500 i saw crushing wounds but there were very few walking wounded
2397501 i think it was most appropriate for judge giles to take action regarding defendant kilpatricks bond considering his most recent behavior
2397502 this was the most extreme option and were obviously going to appeal the trip to canada was taken on the basis that if the deal fell through a significant number of city employees would lose their jobs
2397503 we are negotiating a tunnel deal and now we are involved in a criminal case its absurd
2397504 he says this deal is very important and we need to keep it on track that we need to get in a room and finalize all issues of the deal
2397505 the detroit mayor then asked about the following monday which conflicted with windsors council meeting on tuesday francis had to travel to toronto for a municipal association meeting
2397506 we do not diminish the presss important role in uncovering and reporting an alleged wrongdoing but in our society it is the police who are charged with the critical role of investigating and prosecuting crime
2397507 he saw me staring at him and i said mayor kilpatrick he got up and shook my hand
2397508 god can do anything you know far more than you could ever imagine or guess or request in your wildest dreams he does it not by pushing us around but by working within us his spirit deeply and gently within us

2397517 this satay bee hoon is worth travelling all the way down to eat
2397518 they have discovered water on mars for the third or fourth time
2397519 if i had only bought a spec home a couple of months ago i could have saved tens of thousands of more dollars

2397525 so i let out a little scream and he stands there with his mouth hanaging open and gail my friend who is in the pool says sir please turn around he says im the pool guy i always come at noon on friday anyway i think we scared the poor guy he keep apologizing and ran out of here like his pants were on fire meanwhile gail and i could not stop laughing life is good it is friday after all
2397526 therefore i say to you do not worry about your life what you will eat nor about the body what you will put on
2397527 and do not seek what you should eat or what you should drink nor have an anxious mind 30 for all these things the nations of the world seek after and your father knows that you need these things
2397528 do not fear little flock for it is your fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom
2397529 non capisco perch uno come davide che dormiva e scherzava sia stato promosso con pi di me e non sia stato bocciato
2397530 its good to see public acknowledgment that our story was accurate all along
2397531 probably the biggest question about this whole mess is why the mainstream media protected edwards by ignoring the story for the past 8 months
2397532 i think its entirely appropriate for a news organization to wait to report a story until they have information that theyre comfortable with reporting
2397533 all i can say is that were not in the business of printing things we dont know to be true
2397534 the problem with a story like this is that its very very difficult to ascertain the truth until one of the people steps forward
2397535 the national enquirer is a supermarket tabloid that is accurate some of the time and inaccurate some of the time
2397536 it was the subject of late night talk shows and certainly all over the web
2397537 it was in our culture and in our faces and to act as if it didnt exist would be to ignore reality

2397574 he said that he has not taken a paternity test but that the timing of the affair rules out the possibility that he could be her baby girls father a former campaign aide has publicly said he fathered the child
2397575 i became a full time pastor and a part time follower of christ
2397576 todays college students are more narcissistic and self centered than their predecessors according to a comprehensive new study by five psychologists who worry that the trend could be harmful to personal relationships and american society
2397577 i was thrown on the ground and noticed only the stalks of my flowers were left everything was still and quiet and when i got up there were people naked not saying anything some of them had no skin or hair i was certain i was dead
2397578 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
2397579 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
2397580 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
2397581 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis

2397592 at this time others were receiving intensive maintenance in rsu kisaran whereas two other people were forced to be reconciled by us to rsup h adam malik medan because the medical personnel recorded that their conditions were increasingly worsened and heavy with the condition for a high fever
2397593 we still could not confirm that those who died were affected by bird flu or not because the families buried them before a medical inspection could be carried out however in accordance with protap if one person dies after a week where chickens had suddenly died then they should be been categorized as bird flu suspects
2397594 since yesterday we have continually for a minimum of 12 days established the command post in the suspect location various guidances and counselling as well as assistance efforts to the community continued to be carried out whereas blood samples blood for the laboratory inspection were sent by us to jakarta

2397615 reading in paris about kashmiri muslims rioting because of land transferred to the shri amarnathji shrine board sasb and the peoples democratic party pulling out of the jammu and kashmir government coalition one feels a little bit surprised
2397616 millions of devotees have flocked to amarnath over the centuries and muslims from kashmir should show them generosity because in india although muslims have been a minority since the beginning hindus have always respected the religion of islam
2397617 furthermore indian muslims returning from the gulf have built in the last 20 years tens of thousands of mosques thanks to the gulf money often with land donated by the indian government and without the hindus ever protesting
2397618 kashmir is also the land of sufism where the best of islam and vedanta blended which allowed many generations of kashmiri hindus and muslims to worship together in mosques and temples and attend each others festivals unfortunately after the creation of pakistan a hard sunni fundamentalism has entered the valley mainly with pakistan and afghan jihadis and four lakh kashmiri hindus have been forced by death terror and violence to flee the valley of their ancestors one of the biggest ethnic cleansings in human history
2397619 goi provides air fare subsidy to about 140 000 haj pilgrims annually the cost of it runs close to rs 400 crores annually subsidy runs to about rs 35 000 per pilgrim goi allows every muslim to transport 10 liters of holy zam zam water free of cost there is a separate haj cell in the ministry of external affairs haj committee of india has its own premises in mumbai similarly such committees in each state have their own premises on land and building provided by governments states in india have waqf boards in fact kashmir has a ministry dedicated to muslim affairs almost all of the activities and programs of the indian ambassador in riyadh and consul general in jeddah are haj related despite india proclaiming to be secular all muslims are appointed to these posts accommodations in mecca and medina are provided and they are fitted with lifts phones running water electricity and computers in last years haj a contingent of 115 doctors including 63 specialists 141 nurses 3 coordinators 46 haj officers 165 haj assistants and 186 khadimul hajaj were sent from india facilities provided by the govt include polio meningitis and influenza vaccinations 75 bed hospital and 12 dispensaries another 15 bed hospital and 6 dispensaries in medina 3 medical teams at jeddah airport 17 ambulances in mecca and medina all medical instruments treatments doctors services and medicines are free at delhi air port a special terminal is set up for easy and quick transit of the pilgrims
2397620 perhaps our outrageously petty minded and self righteous muslim leaders of kashmir will tell us what the only muslim majority state in india does in return for the hindu pilgrims in kashmir

2397631 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2397632 the pain of the long journey since 2006 was about to be renewed
2397633 john has spoken in a long on camera interview i hope you watch admitting ones mistakes is a hard thing for anyone to do and i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame the toll on our family of news helicopters over our house and reporters in our driveway is yet unknown but now the truth is out and the repair work that began in 2006 will continue
2397634 i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time
2397635 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2397636 my thoughts and prays go out to the edwards family i hope my fellow republicans will show professionalism in not taking advantage of this tragic event this is not the time to play politics lets show others how we can play grown up signed a devoted republican

2397651 read in the name of your lord who has created everything who has created man from a clot of blood
2397652 for you do many good things you keep families together you bear the burden of the weak you assist the poor and the needy you entertain the guests and endure hardships in the path of truthfulness
2397653 i been reading these emails and posts regarding the meet up
2397654 he will not let you stumble and fall the one who watches over you will not sleep
2397655 the eyes of the lord search the whole earth in order to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him
2397656 the lord gives his own reward for doing good and for being loyal
2397657 the lord your god is the faithful god who keeps his covenant for a thousand generations

2397664 this isnt funny lisas is funny go try again and write something funny this time that was one of the worst classes in my memory
2397665 it was our first date and i got to pick the movie i wanted the husband to know i wasnt afraid of a non chick flick and i knew if there was any comment about just going because matt damon was in it i could honestly say i wasnt into him
2397666 were trying to develop tools software tools that allow people to detect whats happening with their broadband connections so they can let isps know that theyre not happy with what theyre getting that they think certain services are being tampered with
2397667 the forces aligned against us are real theyve been there for decades their pockets are deep their connections are strong with those in washington
2397668 maybe we can turn this into an arms race on the application software side rather a political game
2397669 if the broadband providers arent going to tell you exactly whats happening on their networks
2397670 we want to give users the power to find out for themselves
2397671 the network in this case is not the internet but the broadband network
2397672 what were talking about is the on ramps to the internet controlled not only by the telephone companies and cable companies but now the wireless companies
2397673 the question was raised by the top level management at google what do we think about network neutrality about this notion that broadband companies have the power to pick winners and losers on the internet
2397674 one position was that in the environment proposed by whitacre google would do quite well
2397675 this side of the argument said we were pretty well known on the internet we were pretty popular we had some funds available we could essentially buy prioritization that would ensure we would be the search engine used by everybody we would come out fine a non neutral world would be a good world for us
2397676 the other side said we were a company that was born and raised on innovation we were born from the internet here in silicon valley we were able to take for granted the fact that we could innovate on the network without permission from anybody any broadband company any potential gatekeeper of the network trying to tell us what to do we could bring innovation directly to the users and let them sort out exactly what they wanted and what they didnt want why would we muck with that why would we create haves and have nots on the internet
2397677 and if you forbid converged networks you get a bunch of tiny networks that are designed to do very specific things why not merge them into one fat pipe and let the consumer pick and choose what they want to run
2397678 i think pretty much all of us are for transparency but im for transparency not only for the network providers but also for the applications providers
2397679 the only american company on this panel thats been doing bad things and not telling people is google theyre filtering content in china
2397680 but the one thing were doing in china on search engines based in china is filtering certain search terms and at the bottom of the page we have a disclaimer that says warning your content has been filtered by the government that is transparency
2397681 for the very first time china is holding this international event

2397693 the forum is not about conversion per se as the council endorses the absolute right of individuals to embrace islam
2397694 instead the forum will address the ancillary issues that arise from such situations and will emphasise the need for laws and a judicial system that protects everyone equally
2397695 it is the continued suppression of open and respectful discourse not public forums that will cause tension and jeopardise national unity
2397696 we are taking the necessary precautions to ensure that the dialogue takes place in a controlled and constructive manner by holding the forum in a closed setting and requiring participants to register for the event
2397697 the crowd came forward across again demanding ambiga to go down shouting louder inside a testimony about conversion of a father by the daughter
2397698 the crowd continues to chant slogan not trying to breach police line
2397699 ambiga just came up to say police ask to wrap up by 10 because of security reason
2397700 police wants half day bar council forum on conversion to end by 10 am because of protests
2397701 i listen to things only when they music my my ears otherwise no discussion
2397702 there are three things that i have absolutely no power upon
2397703 1 dice 2 the flow of the river gamo 3 warrior monks of mount hiei
2397704 police accompanied a few of the protestors into the forum to observe proceedings five minutes before the forum is to have abrupt end at 10 am
2397705 as a gauge why not discuss the wanton wastage of money in burning hell notes besides the air pollution created in this ongoing hungry ghost festival i believe that a lot of chinese might be offended too
2397706 it wasnt islams fault it was the muslim believers here
2397707 to ensure all the races can live in harmony and to ensure that umno can continue to steal in broad daylight everyone should avoid discussing openly the followings topics religions issue concerning the muslim anwars case as it is under trial the special rights accorded to malay under the constitution and the national policy aimed to help the poorer ethnic group and any other issue that is sensitive to any of the races whoever does not heed the advice will have to bear the consequence

2397713 yaaa secara rutin ust syifa memberi berita dan meminta berita ke saya
2397714 beliau selalu memberi motivasi dakwah beliau tidak pernah berhenti mengontrol dakwah kami beliau selalu mengingatkan kami
2397715 ada harapan datang sang idola kita ini kita sambut dalam kancah dakwah semoga taushiah bulan depan beliau sudah tampil di hadapan kita
2397716 al hamdulillah saya menyambutnya satu mobil dengan abi h abdullah mas dudo h rofii dan ketua umum

2397722 abi ihya pernah menyampaikan jika ditemukan orang orang islam seperti pak jf ini pasti islam jaya dan menang
2397723 menurut penilaian beliau jf ini telah mengamalkan islam secara tuntas mulai dari ibadahnya dan termasuk infaq dakwahnya
2397724 iyaaa emang pak jf pernah bercerita pada saya bahwa saat beliau mendapatkan rezeqi kemudian beliau infaq dakwah maka rezeqinya bertambah bertambah dan bertambah bahkan beliau hingga merasa ketakutan atas pertambahan rezeqi yang luar biasa banyakknya
2397725 draft dem platform opposes doma but weakens language on lgbt families
2397726 we oppose the defense of marriage act and oppose all attempts to use this issue to divide us
2397727 we support full inclusion of gay and lesbian families in the life of our nation and seek equal responsibilities benefits and protections for these families
2397728 we support full inclusion of all families in the life of our nation and seek equal responsibily benefits and protections
2397729 we have to do more to support and strengthen lgbt families because equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle its about whether millions of lgbt americans can finally live lives marked by dignity and freedom thats why we have to repeal laws like the defense of marriage act thats why we have to eliminate discrimination against lgbt families and thats why we have to extend equal treatment in our family and adoption laws
2397730 draft dem platform opposes doma but weakens language on lgbt families
2397731 differs radically from the circulating title and summary swapping limit on marriage
2397732 so as to be extremely argumentative and create prejudice against the measure
2397733 the title and summary is not false or misleading because it states that proposition 8 would eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry in california the california supreme court unequivocally held in a may 15 decision that same sex couples have a constitutional right to marry under the california constitution
2397734 it is undisputed that if proposition 8 is approved marriage would be limited to individuals of the opposite sex and individuals of the same sex would no longer have the right to marry in california
2397735 in health education classes state law requires teachers to instruct children as young as kindergarteners about marriage if the gay marriage ruling is not overturned teachers will be required to teach young children there is no difference between gay marriage and traditional marriage
2397736 as petitioners have established current state law does not require school districts to teach anything about marriage or same sex marriage at any grade level moreover for those school districts that choose to include instruction about marriage as part of a health education curriculum education code section 51240 requires that they allow parents to excuse their children from any such instruction conflicting with the parents religious or moral convictions
2397737 the california supreme court held that same sex couples have a constitutional right to marry under the california constitution proposition 8 would take away that right
2397738 because proposition 8 would not take away any of the substantive rights or benefits afforded under existing domestic partnership legislation the argument simply needs to be amended to provide that proposition 8 doesnt take away any rights or benefits from gay or lesbian domestic partnerships rather than partners
2397739 draft dem platform opposes doma but weakens language on lgbt families

2397755 the united states must now confront and plan for the reality that adversaries may well be supplying the key hardware and software on which the u s bases its military and economic superiority
2397756 while the united states still has preeminence in computer science asia is rapidly gaining
2397757 the united states retains a pool of talented computer scientists and engineers but the natural tendency of the industry is to seek the lowest cost supply of talent in recent years that has been primarily in india while china and russia are on the rise
2397758 globalization of software development where some of the united states adversaries are writing the code the department of defense will depend upon in war creates a rich opportunity to damage or destroy elements of the war fighters capability
2397759 a new years resolution is a commitment that an individual makes to a project or a habit often a lifestyle change that is generally interpreted as advantageous
2397760 globalization of software development where some u s adversaries are writing the code that defense will depend upon in war creates a rich opportunity to damage or destroy elements of the warfighters capability
2397761 presents an opportunity for threat agents to attack the confidentiality integrity and availability of operating systems middleware and applications that are essential to operations of u s government information systems and the dod
2397762 the most direct threat is foreign corruption of software insertion by the developer of malware backdoors and other intentional flaws that can later by exploited
2397763 dods necessary inevitable and ever increasing reliance on commercial software often developed offshore by software engineers who have little if any allegiance to the united states is likely amplifying dod vulnerability to information operations against all such systems incorporating such software
2397764 malicious code which would facilitate system intrusion would be all but impossible to detect through testing primarily because of softwares extreme and ever increasing complexity increased functionality means increased vulnerability
2397765 low level malicious technologies have been employed to successfully penetrate sensitive unclassified dod systems despite efforts by dod to maintain information security and assurance
2397766 foreign adversaries corruption of the supply chain commercial development processes make no guarantees about the purity or lack of corruption of the supply chain nor could they reasonably do so the overall opaqueness of the software development supply chain and the complexity of software itself make corruption hard to detect
2397767 a difficult quandary in its software purchases in applying intelligent risk management trading off the attractive economics of cots and of custom code written offshore against the risks of encountering malware that could seriously jeopardize future defense missions
2397768 current systems designs assurance methodologies acquisition procedures and knowledge of adversarial intentions
2397769 procure from encourage and leverage the largest possible global competitive marketplace consistent with national security
2397770 the information technology industry is global corporations based at home and abroad depend on a worldwide supply chain to deliver and develop the very best products to the u s government
2397771 our adversaries jockeying for a position on the battlefields of cyberspace
2397772 the problem of detecting vulnerabilities is deeply complex and there is no silver bullet on the horizon
2397773 low to moderate risk that malicious code could be inserted into the fcs master software baseline and exploited
2397774 profit motive will assure clean code in shrink wrapped consumer software
2397775 doesnt want to do it and the army doesnt want to have to pay them to do it
2397776 for the army to say it is not feasible is nonsense
2397777 of course its feasible tedious yes but theyre going to have to do it eventually when problems develop in fcs software that was assembled from a wide variety of sources that turn out not to work effectively together in the overall system of systems
2397778 boeing will need to examine supplier source codes from the start waiting until u s soldiers on the battlefield can prove that a supplier has failed will be too late
2397779 a robust information assurance plan in place potential threats are well known and well understood and processes plus leading edge technology will be used to address the threats additionally as consistent with army regulations and acquisition policy foreign ownership control or influence will be taken into account prior to software development integration or purchase
2397780 were very interested in where they draw the line on what is critical
2397781 provide other mechanisms that would make an attempt to tamper with our source code even more difficult
2397782 the sdl embeds security and privacy milestones at every stage of the development process
2397783 both secure and less secure software can be written anywhere
2397784 because the goal is to produce more secure software it is critically important that vendors leverage the best talent available and that talent may be located both inside and outside the united states
2397785 software for highly sensitive customers is handled in u s based secure environments
2397786 its more fun if theres at least some possibility that youll get an answer you dont like

2397796 aparenta claramente su edad cronol gica esta paciente no logra comunicarse de manera verbal con los m dicos y ni siquiera con sus parientes m s cercanos tampoco da se ales de entender cuando se le habla se pasa horas balbuceando frases incoherentes que nadie comprende y da toda la sensaci n de no saber siquiera quien es ella desorientada en tiempo y espacio por lo que se aprecia observ ndola con detenimiento la paciente no parece saber d nde est ni la fecha en que est viviendo en lo que podr amos calificar como una clara desorientaci n en tiempo y espacio solo de cuando en cuando parece reaccionar cuando se la menciona por su nombre sin que var e todo lo anterior no se interesa en lo mas m nimo en su propio aseo personal y ni siquiera colabora cuando alguien lo hace en su lugar lo cual es imprescindible y a diario ya que la paciente no controla sus necesidades fisiol gicas b sicas y padece de incontinencia de heces y orina por lo que es necesario que otros deban ocuparse de ba arla e incluso vestirla tambi n es imprescindible darle de comer solamente comidas blandas porque carece de dentadura se babea de manera continua y no se preocupa de que sus ropas est n casi siempre manchadas est imposibilitada de andar por sus propios medios su patr n de sue o es altamente conflictivo para aquellos que conviven con ella ya que se despierta por las noches con mucha frecuencia y al hacerlo estalla en gritos y llanto tiene momentos a veces prolongados en los que se muestra en apariencia muy tranquila y amable pero sin que exista un motivo claro que origine algo semejante se muestra repentinamente muy agitada y estalla en nuevas crisis de llanto que suelen ser dif ciles de controlar la situaci n que acabo de describir es permanente y diaria desde hace ya muchos meses

2397801 what i want to do the most i do not do
2397802 we must come to understand that scientific and historical observations are riddled with subjective viewpoints unfortunately we have become a society of truth by consensus in science errors eventually become undetectable because the tools which test the theory are calibrated to the theory
2397803 an example of this is when immanuel velikovsky searched for radio carbon test dates on artifacts in egypts new kingdom
2397804 later it was discovered that many such tests had been conducted but the results were never published and much of the data destroyed the palestine exploration quarterly quotes professor brew saying
2397805 the common excuse for discarding the test results was that all the new kingdom artifacts had been contaminated
2397806 when dr david baker interviewed dr raney of the university of pennsylvania he ask ed about this practice h e replied
2397807 the dating of egyptian history is one of the most controversial matters in the whole realm of archaeology today
2397808 later dr baker spoke with elizabeth ralph director of the radiocarbon lab at the university of pennsylvania he writes
2397809 miss ralph insisted on the wide gap between the so called archaeological dates of egyptian history and those derived for radiocarbon materials in almost every case the radiocarbon dates were significantly younger
2397810 ten years later in 1971 the british museum again tested two new kingdom samples these samples were taken from tutankhamon king tut son of pharaoh akhetaton the test results again showed the time discrepancy despite there being no possibility of contamination
2397811 the two c14 test samples gave dates of 846 b c and 899 b c yet conventional historians all know that king tut lived in the 14th century b c e
2397812 again these test results were never published by the british museum commenting on this stan vaninger says
2397813 the conventional chronology of ancient egypt depends upon several very crucial dates determined by astronomical methods
2397814 yet it is this very astronomical cyclic method which is now being scientifically assaulted by c14 test results

2397831 honey im just going to be honest with you ok i just thought he was cute im 45 years old and id just like to meet him again but i dont know how to go about doing that without calling 911
2397832 i know this is absolutely not in any way shape or form an emergency but if you would give the officer my phone number and ask him to come back would you mind
2397833 thats taking up valuable time from dispatchers who could be taking true emergency calls
2397834 i dont really think i was thinking that much at the time
2397835 i was home already in my pajamas going to bed
2397836 i think a judge will look at her and say you know what

2397838 our officers were standing there scratching their heads he called standing there in their presence
2397839 its one of our truth is stranger than fiction cases

2398313 if any case is too difficult for you to decide between one kind of homicide or another between one kind of lawsuit or another and between one kind of assault or another being cases of dispute in your courts then you shall arise and go up to the place which the lord your god chooses
2398314 so you shall come to the levitical priest or the judge who is in office in those days
2398315 you shall do according to the terms of the verdict which they declare to you from that place which the lord chooses and you shall be careful to observe according to all that they teach you
2398316 according to the terms of the law which they teach you and according to the verdict which they tell you you shall do you shall not turn aside from the word which they declare to you to the right or the left
2398317 the man who acts presumptuously by not listening to the priest who stands there to serve the lord your god nor to the judge that man shall die thus you shall purge the evil from israel

2398322 the police said we will first inquire whether adeel has committed suicide because the culprits told the police about the fact that their daughter wanted to embrace christianity because of adeel
2398323 in this way the police were biased and lingered on the matter because if there is a long delay in the lodging of a first incidence report the case becomes weak

2398325 i dont think justice was served here but i disagree with feminists who use such allegorical
2398326 people especially people in power get away with doing bad and illegal things all the time maybe scott young knew the right people had a good lawyer or just was lucky by your line of reasoning i could look to oj simpson and argue that black people in the us can get away with murdering white people i strongly disagree with feminists who use incidences like this to push their narrow self serving agenda
2398327 no society has ever tolerated violence against women this is feminist historical revisionism rapists in medieval europe were flayed alive had their skin removed the rule of thumb myth was taken from a misquotation of statement made by a us judge in the 19th century who actually sentenced the male abuser to jail
2398328 women are abusers in relationships as well as men domestic abuse has less to do with patriarchy and more to do with disfunctional partners and drug and alchohol abuse women stalk kill their husbands and kill their children too there are bad people of both sexes the same way there are bad people of all races just because in general men are capable of inflicting greater injury on women does not mean that men are the only sex capable of commiting evil or even that society is run by men
2398329 society does not treat women worse than men men have always been the greatest victims of violence in war genocide and crime the vast majority of victims of violent crime murder and assault are men

2398386 rational portrait of the architect intp architects need not be thought of as only interested in drawing blueprints for buildings or roads or bridges they are the master designers of all kinds of theoretical systems including school curricula corporate strategies and new technologies for architects the world exists primarily to be analyzed understood explained and re designed external reality in itself is unimportant little more than raw material to be organized into structural models what is important for architects is that they grasp fundamental principles and natural laws and that their designs are elegant that is efficient and coherent architects are rare maybe one percent of the population and show the greatest precision in thought and speech of all the types they tend to see distinctions and inconsistencies instantaneously and can detect contradictions no matter when or where they were made it is difficult for an architect to listen to nonsense even in a casual conversation without pointing out the speakers error and in any serious discussion or debate architects are devastating their skill in framing arguments giving them an enormous advantage architects regard all discussions as a search for understanding and believe their function is to eliminate inconsistencies which can make communication with them an uncomfortable experience for many ruthless pragmatists about ideas and insatiably curious architects are driven to find the most efficient means to their ends and they will learn in any manner and degree they can they will listen to amateurs if their ideas are useful and will ignore the experts if theirs are not authority derived from office credential or celebrity does not impress them architects are interested only in what make sense and thus only statements that are consistent and coherent carry any weight with them architects often seem difficult to know they are inclined to be shy except with close friends and their reserve is difficult to penetrate able to concentrate better than any other type they prefer to work quietly at their computers or drafting tables and often alone architects also become obsessed with analysis and this can seem to shut others out once caught up in a thought process architects close off and persevere until they comprehend the issue in all its complexity architects prize intelligence and with their grand desire to grasp the structure of the universe they can seem arrogant and may show impatience with others who have less ability or who are less driven

2398388 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world
2398389 forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers but with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you
2398390 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved
2398391 who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world began

2398467 later this evening i intend to watch the video in question click the reply link above the box reserved for user comments and draft a response being careful to put as little thought into it as possible while making sure to use all capital letters and incorrect punctuation
2398468 although i do not yet know exactly what my comment will entail i can say with a great degree of certainty that it will be incredibly stupid
2398469 the result will be an astonishing combination of ignorance offensiveness and sheer idiocy
2398470 it is my moral obligation to alert the internet community to the fact that this video is totally gay and furthermore that the individual who made it is a fag
2398471 after clicking the submit button i will immediately refresh the page so that i can view my own comment i will then notice that my comment has not appeared because the server has not yet processed my request become angry and confused and re post the same comment with unintentional variations on the original wording and misspellings creating two slightly different yet equally moronic comments
2398472 it is my hope that this will illustrate both my childlike level of impatience and my inability to replicate a simple string of letters and symbols 30 seconds after having composed it
2398473 once this minor diversion is complete i will finish posting my comment then sit there like the worthless human being i am and wait for other commenters to respond
2398474 because as i mentioned before i have nothing better to do with my life
2398475 we are blessed to be living in an age when we have a global communications network in which idiots assholes and total and complete wastes of fucking human life alike can come together to give instant feedback in an unfettered and unmonitored online environment

2398511 a more important and far reaching consequence of what the turks referred to as the van revolt was that at this juncture the leadership in constantinople made the decision to exterminate the armenian population of turkey i noted earlier that for various reasons relations between the turkish and armenian communities over the latter half of the nineteenth century had been characterized by outbreaks of violence and large scale massacres many hundreds of thousands of armenians were slaughtered during the nineteenth century the circumstances of the first world war which resulted in armenians on either side of the russian turkish border fighting in opposing armies coupled with the enmity felt by the turks to the armenians and the sympathies of the armenians for the russians created conditions which enabled a genocidal thought to be translated into a genocidal policy the genocidal thought had been part of the collective representations of leading turks for some time in the 1870s abdul hamid had said the sensible thing to do is to destroy and eliminate any and all elements which may some day give rise to the same danger afford the opportunity for foreign intervention and serve as its tool thus we must eliminate leave behind no traces of that armenian nation

2398571 connection with gardens even small ones even potted plants can become windows to the inner life the simple act of stopping and looking at the beauty around us can be prayer
2398572 this is clearly a criminal act in support of a campaign which has been committed with or without their knowledge
2398573 the question is will we see more and more of this or will this bring shame to the campaigns and will they make clear that this is not a form of acceptable behavior by their supporters
2398574 the interesting thing was that we had the same subject line from the same ip address and it claimed to be from different users from within the united states
2398575 i have not seen a malicious code sample yet that is sending these mails therefore i would say its likely that either they are using a botnet or they are using open relays
2398576 if it is true it could be done by a well intentioned yet misguided supporter or someone with bad intentions trying to embarrass the campaign
2398577 either way this is independent work and we have no connection

2398590 everybody seems to concede in this case if the logging didnt happen now it would occur as soon as the permit is issued
2398591 everybody concedes that if the timber company had gotten this contract from a amp g coal this operation would have been shut down
2398592 clear cutting is not a destructive process its a process thats accepted in the life cycle of a timber property
2398593 even though it may be unpopular that doesnt necessarily make it a bad thing and it definitely does not make it coal mining
2398594 if this isnt a surface coal mining operation this court has no jurisdiction or involvement in it at all
2398595 unless you say all logging all over the country is imminent danger of irreparable harm you cant say this one is its just another logging operation
2398596 the plaintiff is arguing for an expansion of the definition of surface coal mining operations beyond the definition intended by congress and beyond what has been developed over the last 30 years
2398597 its a radical change and it upsets the land management and land uses of timber companies and coal companies and upsets the practices of regulatory agencies
2398598 clearly the surface mining control and reclamation act sets out a definition of surface coal mining operation
2398599 its not discretionary with regard to the state regulatory authorities or the interior secretary to decide to ignore that definition is it
2398600 all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out for i came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the fathers will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day
2398601 that the saying might be fulfilled which he spake of them which thou gavest me have i lost none
2398602 as thou hast given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him john 17 2
2398603 i have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world thine they were and thou gavest them me and they have kept thy word
2398604 i pray not for the world but for them which thou hast given me for they are thine john 17 9
2398605 and now i am no more in the world but these are in the world and i come to thee holy father keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me that they may be one as we are john 17 11
2398606 father i will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where i am that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world

2398644 we must turn from our passion from loving ourselves and calling attention to ourselves to a passion for god and serving him regardless of what we look like that our love and passion for the lord is what we treasure not being self consumed and focused not a vain proud woman but consumed and enamored of the lord

2398736 telah tetap bahwa kata sunnah apabila terdapat dalam hadits rasulullah maka yang dimaksud bukan sunnah sebagai lawan wajib apabila dikerjakan mendapat pahala dan apabila di tinggalkan tidak akan berdosa pent
2398737 artinya jalanku dan langkahku yang aku berjalan di atasnya dari apa apa yang aku telah rincikan kepada kalian dari hukum hukum itiqad keyakinan dan amalan amalan baik yang wajib sunnah dan sebagainya
2398738 di dalam hadits tersebut disebutkan kata ashobta as sunnah yaitu jalan yang sesuai dengan syariat
2398739 jalan yang terpuji dan langkah yang diridhai yang telah dibawa oleh rasulullah dari sini jelaslah kekeliruan orang orang yang menisbahkan diri kepada ilmu yang menafsirkan kata sunnah dengan istilah ulama fiqih sehingga mereka terjebak dalam kesalahan yang fatal

2398749 berbahagialah orang yang asing itu mereka adalah orang orang baik yang berada di tengah orang orang yang jahat dan orang yang memusuhinya lebih banyak daripada orang yang mengikuti mereka
2398750 ia adalah orang asing dalam agamanya dikarenakan rusaknya agama mereka asing pada berpegangnya dia terhadap sunnah dikarenakan berpegangnya manusia terhadap bidah asing pada keyakinannya dikarenakan telah rusak keyakinan mereka asing pada shalatnya dikarenakan jelek shalat mereka asing pada jalannya dikarenakan sesat dan rusaknya jalan mereka asing pada nisbahnya dikarenakan rusaknya nisbah mereka asing dalam pergaulannya bersama mereka dikarenakan bergaul dengan apa yang tidak diinginkan oleh hawa nafsu mereka
2398751 fitnah syubhat dan hawa nafsu yang menyesatkan inilah yang telah menyebabkan berpecahnya ahli kiblat menjadi berkeping keping

2398787 what prevents me from doing so is the fact that i would hate to bore you i show consideration towards you by choosing a suitable time to teach you just as the prophet saw used to do with us for fear of making us bored

2398792 i started having flashbacks of my father ripping my clothes off
2398793 hospitals with mandatory clothing removal policies will tell you that they strip psychiatric patients to keep them safe these policies reflect a really distorted understanding of safety
2398794 could have determined whether she was actually likely to harm herself
2398795 such a practice is discriminatory nurses wouldnt have male security guards forcibly strip a rape victim who didnt want to take her clothes off many women with psychiatric disabilities are rape victims thats why they have the psychiatric symptoms in the first place many hospitals now understand how much harm this practice causes i wish beth israel did
2398796 hospitals of all entities need to avoid discriminating against people based on their health conditions perhaps the trauma suffered by cassandra sampson will help educate medical personnel about their responsibilities
2398797 i never thought i would be hurt like this again i knew i didnt deserve it and that a hospital is never supposed to hurt so badly or invade you the way they made me feel
2398798 it is no surprise and should be foreseeable to any hospital or health care worker that the forcible disrobing of a patient such as cassandra sampson with a rape and trauma history is very traumatic and damaging
2398799 there are claims in the complaint seeking compensation for those damages
2398800 we dont have the time to watch you and make sure youre okay

2398812 another motivation for me to write this book was to help draw the extended high family closer together all throughout my childhood i have numerous memories of going to seven mile creek with my family on the first sunday of every august for the high family reunion i remember the numerous dishes that various relatives prepared such as my grandmothers chicken or my great aunt helens lemon pie a vague memory of the family singing a prayer before dinner still lingers in my mind as a child i would always look forward to playing with my second cousins my age in particular i have fond memories of playing with tim and troy peterson and jeffrey and steven swanson as i grew older my family got caught up with other things and slowly stopped going to the family reunion the last family reunion i ever attended was at sibley park in 2000 i remember sitting across from my great aunt myrtle and listening to her tell me about the grandfather i never knew george high when i later discovered that myrtle had passed away two years after this i realized how fortunate i was to have that time with her a dismal memory i have from this event however was how difficult it was for someone to volunteer to arrange the next reunion in the latter years of the high family reunion helen high was looked at as the matriarch of the family and served as the binding force which continued to bring relatives together in december of 2004 helen passed away with helens passing all of my great aunts and uncles from my fathers side were all gone helens passing also heralded the end of the high family reunion soon most of the high family was dispersed all over the country having little contact with one another the many stories and recollections of high ancestors slowly began to fade away within a few generations it was looking like the memories of the high ancestors would be lost forever a deep sense of melancholy fell over me when these sad revelations came to me unless something drastic was done the rich heritage and memory of the highs would die i then remembered a book that i had read when i was young that documented all of the descendants of the high family when asking my brother danny about this he told me that he had a copy looking over the book i realized that it was very outdated having been written in 1972 the idea then came to me to write a new high book which would not only give up to date information but also take a much deeper look into the lives of the many high family members
2398813 i started to think whats the worst that can happen what if they really do play with her shes been extremely lonely since moving here so finally i gave in and let her go out she was right they did play with her shes still out there right now

2398832 its very disheartening to see that instead of uniting people the olympics have begun unsuccessfully

2398989 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help i have given a complete interview on this matter and having done so will have nothing more to say

2398994 obama is correct in saying that the world is ready for someone like him a messiah like figure charismatic and glib the bible calls that leader the antichrist and it seems apparent that the world is now ready to make his acquaintance
2398995 now that theyve met me they can see i dont have two horns and a tail
2398996 those books have created a subliminal language and i think judgments will be made unconsciously about barack obama
2398997 the language in there is so similar to the language in the left behind books
2398998 it should be known that in 2008 the world shall be blessed they will call him the one

2399000 the frequency of these images and references dont make any sense unless youre trying to send the message that obama could be the antichrist

2399006 costruisci pure linceneritore ma non nel mio giardino not in my back yard
2399007 per alimentare linceneritore che funziona secondo le logiche delleconomia di scala afferma ruzzenenti nel suo libro non solo bisogna aumentare a dismisura la produzione di rifiuti in clamorosa contraddizione con le priorit del decreto ronchi e dellue ed importare rifiuti da ogni parte ditalia ma bisogna anche scoraggiare il pi possibile la raccolta differenziata che sottrarrebbe prezioso combustibile alla megamacchina
2399008 le ricerche hanno dimostrato che gli inceneritori producono centinaia di agenti inquinanti fra cui diossine e metalli pesanti
2399009 in sostanza si legge in unintervista rilasciata al quotidiano trentino ladige dallo studioso che svolge ricerche a livello internazionale sulle nanopatologie con gli inceneritori ci liberiamo s di una tonnellata di rifiuti estremamente grossolani ma non facciamo altro che trasformandoli in una tonnellata di fumi contenenti una notevolissima quantit di sostanze tossiche che ritroviamo nellaria che dobbiamo respirare

2399012 demand more than a polite relationship with jesus and his church
2399013 he is our lord and god what he deserves is our love a love that is expressed in our worship in our service to others and in our obedience to the church
2399014 the kind of radical love expressed in obedience an obedience that can make our hearts ache and bruise our vanity is the seed of renewal in every age of the church
2399015 i entered religious life because i wanted to be one of those seeds because i knew my own happiness depended on it i am sure you want to be those seeds of renewal too
2399016 everything the catholic church offers in the way of its sacramental rituals and moral and doctrinal teachings is an obstacle to having a relationship with god
2399017 getting women religious to follow the lead of progressive theologians in renewing themselves into virtual oblivion
2399018 many of the active remnant are among the most aggressively disaffected groups in the church and some publicly declare that the vocation of their community is to go out of business
2399019 the church belongs to christ the church is his spouse and we find his peace through love and obedience to his church which is finally not an institution or corporation or bureaucracy but our mother and teacher
2399020 a difficult crisis due to the aging of members a more or less accentuated fall in vocations and sometimes a spiritual and charismatic weariness

2399025 the peace process will continue even after it is signed with good will patience and wisdom and consultation such further steps will surely resolve substantive questions
2399026 i think its a step by step process theres still a plebiscite and a consultation

2399028 questa grande partecipazione ha commentato emilio bove del comitato ci rincuora vuol dire che c sensibilit popolare su questi argomenti la lotta ancora lontana dallessere vinta la delibera del consiglio provinciale solo uno dei traguardi che devono essere raggiunti per far s che la costruzione di questo inceneritore possa essere finalmente scongiurata
2399029 mi aspettavo questa partecipazione ha dichiarato gianni liverini ispiratore del comitato credo sia la prima volta che in valle telesina si mobiliti cos tanta gente ci sono ciclisti contadini con trattori pedoni tutta gente interessata in modo sincero al problema questo deve essere tenuto in debito conto da chi deve decidere sulla sorte di questo termovalorizzatore
2399030 questa manifestazione importante per tre motivi ha evidenziato il vice sindaco pasquale izzo innanzitutto una affermazione di democrazia del popolo che riprende in mano le redini del suo destino e un momento di solidariet tra i paesi della valle telesina e un momento di unione perch in questo momento istituzioni associazioni e comitati civici si uniscono per perseguire un unico intento quello di evitare che venga costruito il termovalorizzatore

2399054 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2399055 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2399056 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2399057 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2399058 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2399059 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2399060 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2399061 hey this sounds kind of important maybe i should watch this
2399062 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2399099 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
2399100 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics
2399101 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
2399102 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american
2399103 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
2399104 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics

2399152 ma uguale a tutte le altre matite che ho visto nella mia vita
2399153 dipende tutto dal modo in cui guardi le cose questa matita possiede cinque qualit se riuscirai a trasporle nellesistenza sarai sempre una persona in pace con il mondo
2399154 prima qualit puoi fare grandi cose ma non devi mai dimenticare che esiste una mano che guida i tuoi passi che guidi sempre i tuoi passi
2399155 seconda qualit di tanto in tanto devo interrompere la scrittura e usare il temperino unazione che provoca una certa sofferenza alla matita ma alla fine essa risulta pi appuntita ecco perch devi imparare a sopportare alcuni dolori ti faranno diventare un uomo migliore
2399156 terza qualit il tratto della matita ci permette di usare una gomma per cancellare ci che sbagliato correggere unazione o un comportamento non necessariamente qualcosa di negativo anzi importante per riuscire a mantenere la retta via della giustizia
2399157 quarta qualit ci che realmente importante nella matita non il legno o la sua forma esteriore bens la grafite della mina racchiusa in essa dunque presta sempre attenzione a quello che accade dentro di te

2399159 the reason so many families are hurting today is because weve had eight years of failed bush policies that senator mccain wants to continue for another four and thats what barack obama will change as president

2399180 maha suci dia yang telah menampakkan sifat naasuut insaniyah nya lalu muncullah kami sebagai laahuut ilahiyah nya kemudian dia menampakkan diri kepada makhluk nya dalam wujud orang yang makan dan minum sehingga makhluk nya dapat melihat nya dengan jelas seperti pandangan mata dengan pandangan mata
2399181 kami adalah dua ruh yang menitis jadi satu jika engkau melihatku berarti engkau melihat nya dan jika engkau melihat nya berarti yang engkau lihat adalah kami
2399182 paling sempurnanya sifat seseorang yang telah mencapai derajat marifat adalah adanya sifat sifat allah pada dirinya demikian pula sifat ketuhanan ada pada dirinya
2399183 aku heran kepada orang orang yang mengaku mengenal allah bagaimana mereka bisa beribadah kepada nya
2399184 anjing dan babi tidak lain adalah tuhan kami allah itu hanyalah pendeta yang ada di gereja
2399185 dan kami lebih dekat kepadanya hamba daripada urat lehernya sendiri
2399186 dan senantiasa hamba ku mendekatkan diri kapada ku dengan amalan amalan sunnah sampai aku pun mencintainya bila aku mencinatainya maka jadilah aku sebagai telinganya yang dia mendengar dengannya mata yang dia melihat dengannya tangan yang dia memegang sesuatu dengannya dan kaki yang dia berjalan dengannya
2399187 kaum muslimin dari kalangan ahlus sunnah telah bersepakat bahwa makna firman allah yang artinya
2399188 barang siapa yang mengatakan bahwa dzat allah ada di setiap tempat maka dia telah menyelisihi al quran as sunnah dan kesepakatan salaf bersamaan dengan itu dia menyelisihi fitrah dan akal yang allah tetapkan bagi hamba hambanya majmu fatawa 5 125
2399189 dan adapun keyakinan bahwa dzat allah ada di dalam hati setiap orang kafir maupun mukmin maka ini adalah batil
2399190 dan mereka orang orang musyrikin menjadikan sebagian hamba hamba allah sebagai bagian dari nya sesungguhnya manusia itu benar benar pengingkar yang nyata
2399191 kamu sekali sekali tidak sanggup melihat ku tapi lihatlah ke gunung itu tatkala ia tetap ditempat itu niscaya kamu dapat melihat ku tatkala tuhan menampakkan diri kepada gunung itu dijadikan gunung itu hancur luluh dan musa pun pingsan setelah sadar musa berkata maha suci engkau aku bertaubat dan aku orang yang pertama tama beriman
2399192 i am sorry if i hadnt there would be no way to tell for sure only a young boy
2399193 would go so still at my beauty like you have and not a rynx with experience
2399194 if you were anyone else a vampire or one of kiors wolves you wouldnt stand there so drowned in my beauty
2399195 stop this how do you know that i need to feed
2399196 i havent heard a man say that to me in a long time some would imply bad things little boy
2399197 dont worry i know you dont like to play with other boys
2399198 just the same though i can read a rynx like an open book especially one as young as you
2399199 ugh so quick to get to the point mr valare but i am not anea comme trai cichraivien mon ami
2399200 i have only heard of anea for the first time a few weeks ago it seems nathaniel and his friends were quick to find out who was behind all of it before the council could
2399201 i will not say anything about what anea has done except that you do not know everything
2399202 i had my friends bring your own friends here because anea has been trying to contact you four since the beginning of the whole mess two years ago but in every attempt
2399203 in every attempt you either fought her or ran away
2399204 i understand that you did what you had to even the foster home in the west from here was anea trying to corner you and get your full attention she is so very eager to speak with all of you
2399205 so i waited for the moment when nathaniels spell would waver and the powers of the rynx left their bodies and i had them brought here they woke up as rynx once more and tried to resist me but i had already put them under with some special wine of mine im not harming them i promise
2399206 anea is indisposed at the moment you can call me rianna im not a friend of aneas if that answers your question but i am supposed to keep you here in this warehouse until she returns in an hour until then
2399207 i dont know what youre trying to do but helping us wont
2399208 wont what stop me from seducing you and helping you little boy you and your friends may be helping me
2399209 no ive never met anyone like rianna but i doubt shes lying she may be glamouras if thats the word but she isnt powerful enough to stop me from killing her if i were to find out shes lying
2399210 im not sure my friend frankly i dont think i give a damn nathaniel and the rest of you are all i care about
2399211 then again this could still be a trap the only reason i knew your friends were here was because i could sense the rynx returning to them and was careless to bring us here without knowing what would happen but if its an ambush then we need to have the others awake before anea arrives i dont know what she is capable of but more than likely we will need their help or at the very least nathaniels
2399212 i dont know how to break them nathaniel never taught me any of this
2399213 how the fuck did i get home and oh lucky i got clothes on
2399214 oh my god what the hell i am a fucking nut job

2399228 lord i understand the first scene with zigzags and fits i was a new christian i was just learning but you walked on through the storm and helped me learn to walk with you
2399229 and when the smaller footprints were inside of yours i was actually learning to walk in your steps following you very closely
2399230 so when the smaller footprints grew and filled in yours i suppose that i was becoming like you in every way
2399231 so lord was there a regression or something the footprints separated and this time it was worse than at first

2399236 dirk did a really awesome job putting the car on the pole it is the first pole in the alms for the team and also for me tomorrow i will try to stay in front and bring a good car back to dirk i think you have to watch your back here a lot with the long straights there will be some action and you must protect yourself from behind i am really confident for tomorrow
2399237 we were quite optimistic about qualifying we knew after practice that we had a good combination and that the car was strong i just got two really good laps both which would have put me on pole position which makes me very happy personally i am very pleased to give tafel racing its first pole position here in this series now we need to switch back to race mode we need to really think about the four hour race tomorrow we need to stay cool and calm and not make any mistakes i am really looking forward to the race this is the best race track in america these are really challenging corners the combination of having corners with not the best grip and other corners where you have massive grip the whole track is very nice and challenging
2399238 alex did a great job in qualifying today in the race my goal is to stay on the lead lap it is so easy to get split by the safety car and go down a lap it is gt2 russian roulette personally i just want to be smooth consistent and not make any mistakes that is how we will get our results
2399239 i think dave fullerton engineer made some good changes in the practice session before qualifying i am certainly the first one to admit that i havent really figured out qualifying in the gt2 car yet i am not exactly sure on the stickers new tires where you push and where you just try and do the same thing you have been doing for me when i get out there on stickers i still have a little too much of that champ car mentality and i overdrive it a bit i am not disappointed but not overly excited the good thing is that it is a long race and there will probably be some attrition hopefully in front of us the weather here is perfect i am looking forward to the race its going to be fun
2399240 during my stint i had to deal with some changing weather
2399241 we went back and forth between wet and dry conditions which were pretty treacherous no driver wants to deal with that there were times when i was in sixth gear going flat out down the straight and the car turned sideways at 150 mph
2399242 bill did a great job to persevere through tough conditions
2399243 he could have thrown it away at any lap he was driving on a wet track with slick tires it turned out to be a good call in terms of strategy but it was definitely difficult on bill he did what he had to do to keep it on the track he kept it in a good position for joey
2399244 bill did what he had to do to keep the car on the track
2399245 he had to deal with some really crazy conditions rain and dry conditions on slick tires as a driver i know from experience that those are some of the toughest condition to drive in you are running 15 to 20 seconds off of the pace on slick tires that means that it was really slippery out there
2399246 when i got in the car it felt like i was getting thrown into the lions den
2399247 there were some guys who hadnt pitted when we did and i got out right in front of them
2399248 then i found my groove and the car just got better and better i dont know how they do it but every race greg fordahl and all the guys throw a setup on that works this team really works well together and now weve got some momentum going
2399249 joey did an incredible job again today like he did the last race
2399250 he marched it right back to the front unfortunately we just finished a couple seconds off the podium which would have been great this is a very strong finish for us we had the second fastest race lap which we did not expect after our performance yesterday in qualifying it shows that we are really coming were going to be on the podium here real soon i am just so proud of my team and drivers and our engineer greg fordahl had the best car for the race
2399251 the ajr ruby tuesday car is unstoppable we came here this weekend and struggled early and now were looking good these guys are the best with every race we are becoming more aware of everything we controlled the situation today rather than letting the situation control us that is what this team is about it is about responding reacting and then making all the right moves and they made all the right moves today

2399304 i wasnt telling you this to make you go out and sell your truck no no no i just didnt know if you knew about the higher risk and i thought it might be good for you to just have the information when i was in practice i always believed in giving parents information so that they could make the best decisions for their families thats all i wanted to do here again im sorry if i seemed rude or obnoxious have a good day

2399358 sesungguhnya ada orang orang yang mengutamakan pakaian yang terbuat dari bulu domba dengan alasan untuk meneladani al masih bin maryam maka sesungguhnya petunjuk nabi kita lebih kita cintai dari dibanding petunjuk al masih beliau shallallahu alaihi wassalam biasa mengenakan pakaian yang terbuat dari bahan katun dan yang selainnya
2399359 jibril pertama kali turun kepada rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wassalam dengan membawa ilmu syariat dan ketika ilmu itu telah mantap maka turunlah ia untuk kedua kalinya dengan membawa ilmu hakikat beliau shallallahu alaihi wassalam pun mengajarkan ilmu hakikat ini pada orang orang khususnya saja dan yang pertama kali menyampaikan tasawuf adalah ali bin abi thalib radiyallahu anhu kemudian al hasan al bashri rahimahullah menimba darinya

2399386 where you go there i am too i will always be with you
2399387 but for the first practice involving 7 on 7 and 11 on 11 drills the outcome was expected several new plays were implemented and the defense which is projected to be the best in the western athletic conference was particularly feisty yesterday and it rained the three quarterbacks contending for the starting job fourth year junior inoke funaki and junior college transfers greg alexander and brent rausch were a combined 10 of 19 in the 11 on 11 drills
2399388 so much is going through their minds as far as reads and progressions and then you throw the pass rush in and it kind of threw them off theres a lot of good stuff for the film to be studied
2399389 funaki who is first in the rotation lasered a pass to slotback michael washington that went for the 30 play segments only touchdown alexander who has lost 20 pounds since moving to hawaii in late may is displaying better agility and rausch has improved in identifying defensive coverages during his pre snap reads
2399390 im feeling more comfortable out there i did a lot better than the first day
2399391 we have such a good defense if we can compete and be consistent while moving the ball against our own defense it should make things a lot easier when we play against other teams that are less familiar with our offense
2399392 i take it off my experience playing this offense when you can beat your own defense which knows your plays and beat them every day then we can beat anybody in the country thats where we need to get to beat these guys every day
2399393 it gives us a little leeway with our initial plan
2399394 rolovich said those three quarterbacks received an equal number of snaps in the first two practices
2399395 we got better from the first to the second day we had new plays in the third so well be better
2399396 weve got a good defense were always going to get a good look from them its good for us to go against them theyre going to be one of the better defenses we face this season
2399397 it was the defense that set the tone on the first play of 7 on 7 drills leftside linebacker blaze soares soared to intercept funakis pass
2399398 my arm feels better im trying to get into a little better shape i feel im in good shape but its always good to be in better shape you dont ever want to be satisfied
2399399 one of the prized recruits slotback jovonte taylor arrived in town tuesday afternoon and attended yesterdays practice as a spectator taylor was delayed while he completed a class at los angeles southwest college he has been accepted into uh but cannot practice until his associate degree is posted that should happen today taylor won the california community college 100 meter championship in 2007 completing the distance in 10 4 seconds
2399400 track is not really my thing i did it to get ready for football
2399401 taylor had received offers from oregon kansas state and nevada las vegas usc offered him a track scholarship but he chose uh because of its four wide offense and faith that he would earn a degree by this summer
2399402 fits me better they run a spread offense and im a slot receiver they throw the ball a lot thats what im looking for
2399403 inoke funaki greg alexander and brent rausch split the repetitions and combined to complete 15 of 18 throws in the 7 on 7 period but the defense had the advantage in the 11 on 11 team periods
2399404 weve been doing 7 on 7s out here all summer but when you get into practice the intensity picks up and speed picks up
2399405 seven on seven was much better than team for us it tells us they understand it conceptually but now you throw a rush in front of them that kind of threw them off so thats something we need to work on we needed the competition now well see separation the grade sheets have been fairly even so far
2399406 a lot of the newcomer guys were stepping up and making good throws new receivers making great catches it was just good to see the offense click so early
2399407 my chances will be better to play if i know both positions and i feel real comfortable at guard like its a more natural fit for me you always get excited to learn when youre in a new environment if i know guard then ill know tackle better
2399408 pepas going to push kia pretty hard as long as he stays healthy thats going to be a good competition and its going to make both of them better
2399409 it takes me back you dont forget the smells its fun to be out here a part of it and not get all beat up you know
2399410 miano pushed hard for gilmores presence with the team this season he was a walk on from albuquerque n m who through sheer determination earned a starters role and eventually a scholarship
2399411 the whole cycle from being unwanted to being a starter to being a scholarship player to a graduate assistant thats why hell be successful in life and thats why hell be successful at coaching its not always the great players whore genetically gifted he worked hard
2399412 i knew i wanted to do it but i said if im going to do it im going to do it now i dont want to have regrets when im 34 years old
2399413 its always a good thing offense vs defense see who gets bragging rights for the day they work us we work them the only way is up so right now were starting off at the bottom and weve got to climb the ladder to get where we were
2399414 i cant wait to start getting in the pads and see how my shoulder is i feel ready
2399415 for now he and the rest of his teammates are wearing
2399416 i dont want to be known as the kid that always gets hurt which ive been known for i want to change that back then i was just reckless trying to kill everybody in sight this year im just trying to be more smart with the choices i make
2399417 i had to break the ice you know help everybody feel comfortable by throwing the first pick blaze said he was going to beat me up if i didnt throw him a pick
2399418 when you feel like hope is gone look inside you and be strong
2399419 having found trunks of corkscrew willow for my installation i felt above all i was to respect the wood for this reason i didnt use my usual format of vertical wedges to carve the trunks rather i used the remarkable array of joyful and bubbly bark characteristic of the old trees of this species to speak for itself the human input focuses on the upward thrusts of the trunks to make up the gestures of the composition thus the sculpture is in large part a found object that has been adapted to my sculptural needs
2399420 the point is the tree a 150 year old pin oak i want to help people remember what the tree means for ancient cultures for the first nations aztec in mexico and the iroquois in ontario the tree is the connection between earth and sky imagine the tree as a conduit through which energy spirals up from the earth and down from the sky the iroquois would carve a mask or face in the tree and perform rituals and dances around it to bring it energy and a spiritual presence in this installation the spiral patterns of the movement of energy in the ground involve complementary opposites always in movement the earth rows follow the outer lines of the spiral designs with healing plants sweet grass tobacco and sage planted in them the white painted sticks rise in height to suggest the spirals while spiralling white flowers appear on the tree trunk itself
2399421 the nest represents nature in its most perfect symbolism in that the nest is shelter an enclosure a safe place where life is sustained we all live in a time when hyper reality is the norm the nest brings us back to less complicated values and uses nature as a vehicle the nest is a window a place where life begins
2399422 since 1978 my arts practice has been entirely oriented towards nature using natures bounty as material and as the source for my inspiration using vegetation involves working with living material and time each installation is a metaphor for the fragility of the human condition my installation xiii 08 consists of three large urns out of which flow white fir branches signifying that the landscape of hamilton is punctuated by waterfalls these waterfalls are for me the perfect expression of the continuing flux of life
2399423 i think about being in tune with nature in this work i use an s curved line and consider the length of open water for its size it is made of fragile vegetation gathered from the royal botanical gardens phragmite reeds and saplings that are invasive yet wonderful for making my art the reeds are interlaced into the saplings the quiet area of grindstone creek marsh permits my art to almost be a part of nature especially when reflected in the water it is vulnerable in the stream for a moment of life
2399424 the ramps are of varying lengths the longest being about 12 metres these bridges move from the earth upwards visually they are illusionary symbolizing our unconscious links to nature the bridges act as a visual point of entry into the tree and are covered with plants earth and grasses the tree is central to all of this towards nature is yet another metaphor to illustrate this theme as with many of my works of that artificial gap between human culture and nature and so this series of bridges toward nature these are bridges between nature and humanity and my art seeks to bring us integrally closer
2399425 in an earlier work sketch for new forest i used oak sawdust and shavings the waste material created when an oak tree is transformed into lumber to draw a full sized oak tree on a gallery floor temporarily returning the material to its original form with ground i use a similar material tree mulch but with an opposite intent to obscure or erase the form of a dying ask tree by burying the tree beneath the material memory of other trees set in one of the avenues of trees in the arboretum ground also playfully echoes and exaggerates both the topography of the site and the ubiquitous mounds of mulch placed around the base of many of the trees by the gardeners

2399428 wind beneath my wings by bette midler read the post about it
2399429 kiss me youre beautiful these are truly the last days
2399430 have you ever been in love it makes you so vulnerable it opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up you build up all these defenses you build up a whole suit of armor so that nothing can hurt you then one person no different from any other person wanders into your life you give them a piece of you they didnt ask for it they did something dumb one day like kiss you or smile at you and then your life isnt your own anymore love takes hostages it gets inside you it eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness so simple a phrase like maybe we should be just friends turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart it hurts not just in the imagination not just in the mind its a soul hurt a real gets inside you and rips you apart pain i hate love
2399431 hopefully its sooner than later they think its a disc thing going on but theyre not really sure what the deal is
2399432 anytime you deal with a back its hard youve got to be cautious football is where he is now but hes got a full life to live we want to make sure that things get treated correctly
2399433 i was trying to make a cut and i just dropped dont really have strength on my right side the injury caused everything to cramp up
2399434 theyve got me doing all kinds of rehab im trying to get back in place
2399435 it was one of those things i hope it gets better
2399436 all of his appendages are still on him he can suit up
2399437 gerke is a tough mother he demands a lot just like dave was injured today but he had him out there in full pads hes going to have the running backs tougher than heck and theyre running well
2399438 being a long time line coach you have one mentality to coach with the bottom line is youve got to be a tough nut youve got to be physical and nothing can affect you mentally
2399439 its one of those deals where you have no choice hes got to do that
2399440 they hit us they knock us back and we hear it from them when meetings come around were getting yelled at by the coach were tired of it weve got to hit back as much as the linebackers hit us weve got the best linebackers in my opinion in the nation if we stick them were going to be able to stick other guys thats how i see it
2399441 this is only day 4 the guys have a long long way to go the only problem well have is if they think theyve arrived as long as they keep their nose on the grindstone we should be ok
2399442 the message is not lost on libre who appears to be the most physically fit of the running backs libre said he felt compelled to work on improving his strength and punch the open handed blocking technique during summer workouts in addition to weight training libre worked on one on one blocking drills against teammates and hitting the heavy punching bag
2399443 we havent peaked yet except for libre who is in the best shape we have a lot of things we have to get acclimated with whos going to be our quarterback and with our line weve got to become one once we become one everything is going to fall into place
2399444 once again leftside linebacker blaze soares came up with the defensive play of yesterdays practice in the 7 on 7 drill slotback aaron bain caught a pass from jake santos soares hit bain knocking free bains helmet
2399445 it wasnt intentional he just came across the middle i was there i gave him a nice whack and apparently his helmet came off
2399446 jantz probably would have been at a pac 10 school if he had not suffered a broken fibia during nevada union highs second game last year he already had received offers from nevada and san jose state and oregon state and california had expressed strong interest he underwent surgery in which a rod was inserted into his left leg by then all of the offers were pulled
2399447 slotback rick taylor is the answer to this trivia question who is the only receiver to have caught passes from former uh quarterback colt brennan and florida quarterback tim tebow
2399448 hes a good quarterback a good human being a good christian and a good teammate
2399449 right now the depth chart is in pencil along with a pencil youve got an eraser people are moving up and down that makes the competition good when davone bess and ryan grice mullins were here they were pretty much set it was a little tougher to compete its good now that the competition is open
2399450 kicker brett symonds proudly announced that he weighs 147 pounds
2399451 i was thinking about not playing because my girlfriend was pregnant and i didnt know what to do in that situation i didnt know how to handle football and a kid i was still young i talked to some of the coaches and they told me that having a kid would make me work harder and it turns out things worked out it helped me a lot it changed my whole life around in terms of working hard and not being so lazy studying harder all that kind of stuff
2399452 purcell practiced with the first unit yesterday because starting right end john fonoti is out with an injured hamstring
2399453 im going to try to get out earlier than that but i dont want to get out too early and pull it again and make it worse
2399454 hes doing good so far he said he just needs to work on his plays a little bit i dont know what hes talking about because he did good today
2399455 the defensive end depth is something thats an issue right now in camp theres opportunity for a bunch of guys in that mix elliott is in that mix c j allen jones is in the mix cameron allen jones is in that mix and so really to see those three compete its been good so far
2399456 after practice purcell sat with his girlfriend keani santos and 10 month old son taimane which means diamond in samoan in the grass hills near the field soaking up the limited time he had with his family during fall camp
2399457 my son i always think of him i always try to do better because of him i always try to do better in school because of him he made me a better person at the same time its hard because football takes me away from my family i know this is my family here but it takes a lot away from my son i dont want to miss his first step and his first words but at the same time its better for him
2399458 it felt good it was pretty fast faster than twos and threes
2399459 hes focused and theres been a vigor in him so far this camp and it speaks well for his future here
2399460 i do a lot of good things just not consecutively its like spurts so i just have to put it together
2399461 and aaron it finally clicked for him to be consistent and hes the big 12 leader in sacks to this day the talent level is there for elliott
2399462 it was apparent to uh coaches in 2007 when they moved purcell from the scout team midway through the season and still awarded him with the award for 2007 defensive scout team player of the year
2399463 is very soft spoken hes honest hes up front with you humble and very respectful and when he gets on the field he lets it go so its good to see
2399464 any time youve been out of the game five months and you put the helmet on and shoulder pads and get ready to go thats exciting a lot of positions are open and a lot of guys are competing for those positions so the intensity is even higher and weve got florida on aug 30 we know the intensity has to be up every play
2399465 soares met slot receiver aaron bain coming across the middle and even though he pulled up on the hit the impact was enough to pop bains helmet off the bottom line though bain held on to the ball
2399466 we all expect to get one of those every now and then but its all good that means every ones practicing at a high level you always have to look out for blaze the job is to catch the rock so i had to go up and get it
2399467 were right where we should be weve been getting a little better were not close to where we want to be but were moving along as scheduled
2399468 i think its a lot harder to gain weight and keep it than to lose it i can lose weight easily
2399469 he came back a lot bigger and i think it was a good move to bring him down from linebacker to defensive end hes going to do some great things
2399470 we expected great things from c j coming in to this fall camp and he has exceeded our expectations
2399471 we had a meeting wednesday morning talking about whos done what and c j was the guy who around the room everyone was saying hes really shown up to play
2399472 we had a lot of competition and stuff at linebacker
2399473 they run fast and they hit hard and theyre all smart so i figured id move down and help the team any way i can
2399474 just one gap in front of you kick the guys tail in front of you and get that quarterback
2399475 i was just trying to have fun trying to make practice as fun as possible
2399476 were really working hard and sometimes people forget to have fun
2399477 i was just waiting to see when we were going to run the rock but once we did we have to do what we can
2399478 whatever the coaches want thats all im trying to do if they want us to block were going to block our butts off if they want us to run were going to run
2399479 he took advantage of it he had his best day today
2399480 elliotts issue has always been consistency the talent levels there
2399481 were real fortunate with our defensive tackle depth so were looking at guys working with different guys
2399482 well see if they keep improving we have to make some decisions by saturday its going to be tough decisions the guys are working hard theyre competing thats the big thing our defense is such a good defense were getting a good look
2399483 i dont know who just someone on the internet tell whoever made it i said thanks

2399557 my take is that competitors will die off because there is strong brand loyalty similar to the ebay idea everyone created an auction site while ebay was hot ie true religion premium denim jeans but who was leftover plus trlg is on top of their fashion trends and the margins are so good and the cashflow is so great that we are far far away from this stock being a short candidate short if you want here but it will be painful for awhile

2399588 this is apparently a rapidly developing investigation and the normal tool for the federal government is to issue subpoenas so it can get a hold of documents and start analyzing those documents to see if there is any criminal infraction
2399589 it is happening very quickly but obliviously a very significant development up until this point there have been fbi agents asking questions but now with issue of subpoenas and the grand jury it is going to ramp up the investigation
2399590 typically lawyers are going to want to get the documents first that are relevant to the issues before they start questioning witnesses before the grand jury
2399591 in the weeks and month to come you can probably expect some subpoenas for individuals to tesify
2399592 if they u s attorneys office were really concerned about the destruction of documents search warrants would have been issued instead of subpoenas to get the documents delivered

2399610 i learned if i reach the rank of sergeant and go to boot camp i can enter the marines as a private first class and earn an extra 3 000 a year
2399611 that indicates the path these children might take when you dress up children in military uniforms with military training and discipline and guns theyre going to be influenced
2399612 they start pounding those things into your head at such a young age
2399613 they advance you by how well you follow orders they teach you to not think critically or creatively
2399614 i would be uncomfortable putting my 8 year old in a uniform
2399615 but im also uncomfortable with a reflexive anti anything that has to do with the military especially in a country that has an all volunteer force
2399616 the best thing to do if youre interested is go down to one of their units check it out and see if its right for you and your kid
2399617 its very akin to what the boy scouts and the girl scouts do teaching accountability and responsibility but in a military model and isnt that what christianity is all about to transform us certainly not to kill each other but to transform us
2399618 i tell parents im not trying to make marines out of their kids
2399619 but i am trying to teach them good positive values honor courage teamwork responsibility and abstaining from drugs and alcohol

2399628 to find that as recently as perhaps 13 000 years ago there was another upright bipedal although small brained creature walking the planet at the same time as modern humans is as exciting as it was unexpected
2399629 to have early humans on the remote island of flores is surprising enough that some are only about a meter tall with a chimp size brain is even more remarkable that they were still there less than 20 000 years ago and that modern humans must have met them is astonishing
2399630 homo floresiensis is an addition to the short list of other human species that lived at the same time as modern humans i think people will be surprised to learn that not so long ago we were not alone
2399631 physically they were about the size of a three year old homo sapiens modern human child but with a braincase only one third as large
2399632 they had slightly longer arms than us more conspicuously they had hard thicker eyebrow ridges than us a sharply sloping forehead and no chin
2399633 while they dont look like modern humans some of their behaviors were surprisingly human
2399634 they survived alongside us homo sapiens for at least 30 000 years and were not known for being very amiable eco companions
2399635 given that homo floresiensis is the smallest human species ever discovered they out punch every known human intellectually pound for pound
2399636 looked at from a regional perspective we definitely have modern humans in australia from at least 40 000 years ago and in borneo from at least 43 000 years ago
2399637 so there was temporal overlap between the hobbits and ourselves from at least 40 000 years ago until at least 18 000 years ago more than 20 000 years minimum what was the nature of their interaction we have absolutely no idea we need more sites and more hard evidence and thats the next phase of our investigation
2399638 while there are stone tools dated as far back as 840 000 years ago no fossils of large bodied ancestors have ever been found
2399639 there is some possibility homo floresiensis arrived on the island small bodied

2399642 the district has failed to make a good faith attempt to comply with the supreme courts holding in its continued ban on semi automatic hand guns and rifles is directly contrary to hellers holding that ordinary every day weapons are constitutionally protected also the districts trigger lock requirement continues to prevent effective use of a firearm for self defense

2399735 the way in which the situation in south ossetia has deteriorated is cause for profound concern it is extremely important that all those involved show restraint and play their part in bringing about a political solution
2399736 there have been reports of russian warplanes having dropped bombs inside georgia beyond south ossetia and these reports have now been confirmed by various parties this is cause for great concern if this is the case it is a violation of georgias territorial integrity a great responsibility rests on russia and i expect russia to act constructively and with restraint

2399751 the discovery of such a large population of western lowland gorillas is absolutely fantastic news for the sub species and for conservationists but we should be careful not to be too complacent
2399752 the area where these gorillas have been found is in the path of the ebola virus which has wiped out large numbers of western lowland gorillas during the past 25 years
