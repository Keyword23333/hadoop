9240111 if i cannot find something satisfying here there is a possibility i might end up in japan playing ball
9240112 ive seen every team every ballpark i think it would be great to experience a new league and something new i played in japan in 2000 on the major league all star tour and i found it very cool good baseball good fans why not its a new culture
9240113 i got a text message from former as teammate eric byrnes that said dude my wife just saw you on a billboard in vegas
9240114 that just looks bad like im not focusing on baseball
9240115 it was another great day with the riley foundation folks
9240116 the weather was fantastic and we had a wonderful turnout were glad the dsr sponsors and employees continue to support this event and make it what it is a win win for the nhra race fans and the local brownsburg community
9240117 i cant explain just how happy i am to be helping conquest racing this weekend and to get my first start in the indycar series this will be a great opportunity for me to show what i can do im aware that it will not be easy for me coming in at the last minute and learning a new car in a new racing series but im definitely motivated on doing my best and helping conquest this weekend
9240118 i couldnt give my all today because of my left hand i was turning into the pits with just one hand on the steering wheel and was unable to do my best the track is bumpy and it was really hard on my hand i hate having to miss a race but i prefer leaving the car to alex tagliani this weekend while i rest up my hand in order for it to get better
9240119 its unfortunate what happened to enrique in sonoma last week and that its causing him to miss this weeks race on the other hand im happy to be welcoming alex into the team this weekend obviously it will be a big challenge for him as he will not get that much time in the car before the race but alex has a lot of experience especially on street courses and hes raced here in the past as well i think he will be able to adapt quickly to his new racing environment and it will be interesting to see how he does this weekend
9240120 the fact that he took the flag and excelled racing in formula one he was kind of a hero for all of us in the united states during that period he had great talent i got to know phil when his son and my son were racing in atlantics and he was very dedicated to motorsports and just a great guy the cars were a lot different than today but the idea is the same to get in the car and make it go as fast as you can accept the challenges and go racing
9240121 this is another great opportunity to spend time with friends from home and see them play its rare that we get to see each other in action i know they wanted to come to the track today but they had some obligations that kept that from happening im fortunate to be able to have chance to see the game tonight ive never seen the tigers play ive heard nothing but great things about the ballpark and their staff im really grateful for everyone making this possible and to meet and spend time with all the players before the game its going to be a fun night
9240122 we pride ourselves on spending most of our time on strategy as a team i think we still have that in our pocket and our position on pit lane definitely helps during the race hopefully we can save some fuel and keep that going there is going to be a lot of people trying different strategies to improve their positions a lot of the guys and girls eight to 10 starting spots back are going to try some pretty crazy things well keep our mind focused on the race and try to go for the win
9240123 we have a great car i knew this was going to be between scott dixon and me it will be very close between both of us on the second round i decided to predict a little bit what the track might have with the thicker tires and we made a very small change but those changes were enough to unfortunately make the car a little bit difficult and loose we changed and went back out there that change definitely proved that was bad when we got to the slower section turns 4 5 and 6 the car just lost the edge on the tire for it to turn quick and unfortunately that edge was enough to make the gap between scott and me so i really tried i was pushing as hard as i could but unfortunately we couldnt put in a better lap second is not bad actually its pretty good were going to try to do everything we can to win the race tomorrow
9240124 i dont how it was easy for helio castroneves but i always find here you have to push so hard in qualifying i find this qualifying format really amazing it really asks a lot from the drivers if youre not a driver i dont think you can understand how much we have to push and how many times usually in qualifying you always find some magic from somewhere here you have to do it two sets of tires per segment youre really pushing so hard at the end in the last segment and you really need to have tires and pressures to be a one hit wonder im really happy to be able to put it together obviously we didnt have enough for scott dixon at all i dont know how he put that lap together im happy for the team to be third again and showing that we are closer and closer to the big guys
9240125 it was a pretty stressful day we didnt think we were going to make it into the firestone fast six we were very quick and things were going well but we were never got to do a full timed lap in the first session so there was a risk of not making it to the second round but one quick lap at the end got us into the next 12 then we were third in the next session and i wasnt happy with my lap in the final six but i suppose well make the most of it and hopefully finish on the podium with my teammate
9240126 it was the usual extremely competitive qualifying session its a little disappointing i havent been 100 percent happy with the balance around here yet we keep working on it and we definitely made some gains being in the top six again is great it was a good effort from team penske and certainly put us in a good position for the race
9240127 we have been performing extremely well in all of the road courses wherever we go this year it really shows the consistency of the competitiveness
9240128 the track is rubbering in so it is getting better but actually you notice the difference from the start of qualifying to the end of it because it is really warmi ng up in the middle of the day anyway and was getting hotter and hotter heading to the fast six i think the balance was changing a little bit for me it is always like that in these qualifying sessions and really keeps you on your toes
9240129 it was a pretty good run and the car was really good at the end of the day we came up just a little short but we were happy to be in the firestone fast six
9240130 its really disappointing we timed nothing right this session i had to lift all the time for traffic and i never got a rhythm going in either session both times we had to pull out a time at the end of the run and it just didnt work out for us
9240131 this track is so particular that if you make one wrong change you can lose a full second the team 7 eleven car was close to making it but i didnt know what else to do we made a change and it went the wrong way and of course we missed the firestone fast six for only the second time its definitely disappointing
9240132 i was really hoping to get the motorola car into the firestone fast six today but we lost a little time during the second run we are just a little off the lead pack and hopefully we can figure out that small piece that we are missing by the time the race starts tomorrow but we were able to get into the fast 12 these past two weekends so we are definitely headed in the right direction on the road courses
9240133 we kept going quicker and quicker on both of my fastest laps i was passing cars so its great that were starting on the front row but i definitely think we had a pole car today because i didnt get the most out of it catching traffic the car was really consistent like it was in qualifying at sonoma i think we have a really good race car again but it really wouldve been nice to be on the pole again
9240134 i dont think its going to come down to speed at all its going to come down to more about whos got the most reliable car here and about getting through traffic cleanly because its unbelievable how tough it is to pass here thats what its going to come down to
9240135 that was just a fantastic job by the suntrust team and a fantastic job by michael
9240136 you know i always like to be the fastest pontiac because thats all we have to compare ourselves to so im looking forward to the race i think the facility is going to be great but i think we should separate the classes for the race for safetys sake this time around especially with what happened here on thursday

9240172 it would mean a lot for a local guy if he could win the race
9240173 this race is in honor of james garrison and his family james was always around racing ever since i can remember he was always a part of lanier he would always have the equipment trailer ready and stocked with parts in case someone broke something hopefully we can keep our winning ways going and win this one for james
9240174 the whole week didnt start too good gem brought me the news sorenson signing so it was a rough week the whole week didnt turn out like we wanted it to for the whole team elliott sadler and kasey kahne had a bad weekend so its just a weekend to forget well come back this week and try to do a lot better we should be ok here
9240175 were looking there are a lot of cars that havent decided yet ganassi and penske and a few other teams yates and few guys want to add some cars or change so well see what it is there are a lot of guys drivers looking out there knocking on doors laughs
9240176 i think it is all the guys who arent in the top 35 are going to have high interest but well see what happens in this sport you never know every ride is sponsorship dependent now teams are searching for sponsors and are a little bit hungrier because money is a little bit scarcer than what its been before because of the economy last year we had really good timing with mr gillett and the canadiens and the car so everything worked out this year timing isnt as good but hopefully well get to work it out
9240177 adding another asset to the current partnership with new hampshire motor speedway was an easy decision
9240178 race fans at new hampshire motor speedway will now be able to enjoy the nascar camping world series race on friday followed by the camping world rv rental 200 on saturday
9240179 camping world is such a valued member of our family
9240180 their support of our truck series race in september and our nascar nationwide series event in june really helps us bring the greatest racing in the world to our fans
9240181 i dont think so i dont know what probation means but ive been on it before and it didnt change anything for me i think what it means is that you just cant go and wreck somebody or they
9240182 as far as carl and kyle i think its great theres a little rivalry there now its going to make it interesting it should be good for the fans and im a fan so im going to enjoy watching what they do between each other i think its good there both awesome drivers with awesome teams
9240183 i dont think that its too bad its definitely hot its a hot race but once the sun goes down it cools off pretty good its not too bad theres a lot of time at this track where you can relax going down the straightaway a little bit i wouldnt say that its one of the more physically demanding tracks
9240184 id say it compares to michigan international speedway the corners are so long that you can have a loose car and work through the corners a lot which can wear you out get your heart rate up its not too bad
9240185 i trust mine spotter a lot it just depends on what kind of spotter you want some of the spotters feel like they control a lot more than they do they feel like if i clear a car the other guy is going to back off thats not the spotters decision between me and my spotter we have a good relationship where he doesnt clear me unless im clear thats just the way it is hell let me know if its real close to clear or whatever it is thats how we work i think thats the best way a lot of time spotters get cocky up there and they think that they can just clear a guy and the other guy is going to lift and if michael waltrip decides not to lift theres going to be a big wreck and thats what happened in bristol
9240186 its not very good to look at that way thats the way it is its disappointing but its the way our teams have been its the way gillett evernham has been its the way our drivers have been you can look at the other dodge teams its the way theyve been as well its disappointing but thats where we are at its the situation we are in weve come a long ways since last year and were working to get past that to start making more chases than we miss it takes time
9240187 im looking forward to it i think ganassi has a great irl team but their cup stuff to date hasnt been all that great i know how much our stuff has gone up and down and theyre similar to that probably not as good as we are i think reed has to get his confidence back and if he gets into some good cars i think hell get his confidence back and will be good he was good right when he got into the sport i dont see why he cant be up there again
9240188 no me and reed race each other the same for three years id say well race each other the same this weekend
9240189 we ran well at springfield a couple of weeks ago starting eight and finishing eighth i just want to do the same at duquoin and leave there with the points lead
9240190 i really didnt have a lot of fun at springfield it was a disappointing weekend all around im hoping this weekend goes much better and we can get our momentum back to head to chicago
9240191 im looking forward to heading to duquoin this weekend we have had great momentum lately despite a rough day at springfield we still managed a strong finish my team worked really hard and i appreciate all their effort they put us back on track with a competitive car and i was able to drive 20 places to a top 15 im confident we can start the aarons lucky dog toyota a lot closer to the front and have a strong run
9240192 we set the bar pretty high last year and i wasnt sure if we would be able to match it this time around
9240193 once again our friends and the san diego community stepped up the money we raised will definitely complete the four houses we are building with habitat and hopefully allow us to do even more in the san diego area
9240194 helmets are pretty special to me and i very rarely part with them
9240195 this one was pretty special to a lot of people with all the charities represented on it i just hope we can take it to victory lane this weekend for them as well as the winning bidder
9240196 being an el cajon resident i wanted to raise my children here but didnt think it would ever be possible to be a homeowner in southern california
9240197 the jimmie johnson foundation and san diego habitat for humanity have given me the opportunity to own my home and provide a safe place to raise my children
9240198 the kids keep telling everyone they cant wait to have their first barbecue they even asked jimmie to come
9240199 this has truly been a remarkable week for san diego habitat for humanity
9240200 we are extremely grateful to the johnsons for their commitment to complete the four home project their efforts have resulted in four families from jimmies hometown having a place to call home for many years to come
9240201 its just one of those things where crew chiefs mike green and alan johnson u s army dragster work so close together
9240202 with the fram dragster being the next to last car right before tony schumacher ran i knew we had a good shot when we saw the car in front of us smoke the tires i think mike made one little adjustment
9240203 when the fram car left the starting line it had the front end hiked way up there for a long way and thats usually a good indicator
9240204 and when it set the front end down it made a good charge in the middle of the track i knew it was on a good run it started spinning the tires a little bit at the other end and i was just hanging on to it to get through there
9240205 this fram team has just gotten better and better as weve gone along this is the perfect time to make this kind of move its the perfect start to the weekend
9240206 it was good i was discussing the changes with the guys from this morning with the guys it was a little too loose and last week we got so loose in qualifying and it was my fault it was both our faults we stopped too early in practice this time i tell you we used it all the way to the end it was good we made the perfect changes the car was amazing and really stuck well in three and four a little tight in one and two but thats how i like it and they did a great job
9240207 its fun smiles and when we came to test here we were slow and the guys changed the car so much and then when we came to race here didnt even do a lap this morning i was still wondering where to go to get to my garage smile im glad its sunny today and i think weve got a good car i mean elliott sadler his teammate again he came and talked to me again and said you know pat youve got to do it this way i did it this way and that guy has been so great thats what so hard you know well see whats going to happen next year i know theyre working hard on a fourth car there so hopefully it works out its great i needed it last week was such a bad week all around we didnt make bristol now we learned and we made that one
9240208 yeah it sure was probably one of the only guys that ran a second lap but we had to it got way loose on me in the middle of one and two on the first lap and actually had to get out of it had to brake a little bit just to get er slowed down and get er back underneath me i was really happy with the second lap i was thinking if we werent that great in qualifying if we could run a 40 9 that would have been good but then after that now im disappointed because i think we could have ran in the sixes somewhere tough day for us but i feel like we have a much better racecar than we had a qualifying car anyhow so the big thing for us is to go out there on sunday and keep the thing all put together and running well and hopefully be able to move our way up
9240209 our budweiser dodge has been handling well all weekend it wasnt the fastest car either time weve been on the track today but weve been close we will find out tomorrow how good our car is in race trim well keep working on it tomorrow and hopefully sunday night well have a shot at the win we want to be on the track as much as we possibly can thats how we can make the car better so well use both practice sessions tomorrow to tune the car for a race setup
9240210 it was a good lap i was discussing the changes with the crew guys this morning it was a little too loose last week i got so loose in qualifying it was my fault we stopped qualifying setup too early in practice this time we used it practice time all the way to the end we made the perfect changes the car was amazing it really stuck well in turns 3 and 4 it was a little tight in turns 1 and 2 but thats how i like it they did a great job
9240211 i really think we have something for these guys sunday the wind was definitely affecting the car in qualifying the wind affects this car more than it did the old car this is the car we had at indy and michigan that we ran so well with the guys in the shop worked very hard to turn this car around so we could bring it here i hope it pays off for us ive won here before won the first night race here that may be a little better than what we thought we could run i dont expect that to hold up for us to go out second and run that kind of lap time im ecstatic plus the car is driving great we should have a great weekend
9240212 i felt like we made a good change on our miller lite dodge after practice to help with our tightness the car was actually a little loose on our qualifying run in my mind its a good day when you can diagnose your problem from practice make an adjustment with this new car and make your car better making those adjustments is an area that we have really struggled with this year overall it was a great lap for us and gives us a good starting spot for sunday
9240213 thats about right i figured the worst 18th and the best 12th i said that to someone before i went out it was a decent pickup from where we were obviously the track is a little quicker we went almost a half second quicker it was decent run for the kodak dodge but not at all where we want to be tomorrow is super important the first practice session will be a little more difficult than the second but either way you can see where youre at compared to the competition weve run well here but weve been struggling at these two mile tracks this year the only people having fun are the 18 and 99 thats pretty obvious
9240214 it was a pretty good lap for our texaco havoline dodge i was a little tight coming to the green flag and i had to get out of the gas a bit i probably lost a tenth or two at the green flag were making progress on the car we came off the truck today with a completely different car from what weve been running so its a good sign to know that were not too far off
9240215 we brought a new car here to fontana and unloaded what we thought would be a good combination it wasnt too bad just not fast enough for being the third car out for qualifying we never got any speed in the car but we made some changes to the car right before qualifying in trying to pick up a few tenths well be ok
9240216 the track is hot and slippery we qualified 12th at michigan and thought we could have a good run here it seemed like i was on top of the racetrack not hooked up with the asphalt all the way around that wasnt nearly fast enough now we have to get ready for the race i feel like we have a good opportunity to get the car handling better in practice tomorrow and have a good run sunday
9240217 the qualifying run was ok we were way off this morning but our wells fargo guys stuck to their plan and it paid off this is the first time that ive been back to a two mile track since i got out of the car late last spring i just havent been on the race track and wasnt really sure what to expect today obviously my crew guys have learned a whole heck of a lot in a short time that ive been gone because they got us closer and closer today i can tell that weve gotten better with bump stops and spring set ups because the car just drives much better like i tell them im and old dog its tough to teach me new tricks laughs
9240218 not a good lap for us but well be ok we ran about seven laps in race trim and our target dodge was pretty good we changed to qualifying trim and didnt get too much faster our race trim seems to be balanced pretty good the cool thing about fontana is that its one of the tracks that you can pass some cars so qualifying in the back of the field doesnt kill your race day well keep wrenching on it tomorrow and see if we can make it faster on some long runs
9240219 well i definitely think that weve gone a little bit under the radar weve led the rookie points for seven consecutive races and up until that point we hadnt lost the rookie lead until we missed a couple of races there at the road courses and ron fellows did a great job filling in for us so i think from that standpoint weve definitely gone under the radar maybe its rightfully so sam has got great credentials with the indy 500s and the championships and things like that on a national market but i am driving for dei and theyve done a great job this year the car has been solidly in the top 35 all season long and weve had some good runs and finished races like i said i dont know if its justified or not but maybe a little bit as for next year were working through all that stuff right now my first option would definitely be to remain at dei where im at i like it there i believe in the direction of the companys going i believe in the people that weve added on recently bobby hutchens my crew chief dan stillman and i really feel like my teams coming into its own right now were starting to get setups that like i said earlier that are more for me and that what i want to feel in the racecar thats the first option but a lot of that is depending on sponsors and other moves that different drivers make im not na ve ive been out looking around the garage too and talked to a lot of people and have some other opportunities out there also
9240220 i still question myself obviously from running indy cars to coming over here people would be blown away to know how much different what you feel out of the car what you want to feel out of the car and how you express the changes and even what the changes would be i still question myself quite a bit when im telling those guys that but im kind of finding myself more and more after michigan even after last weekend in a couple of races leading up to that point i tried to lead them in a certain direction and then on race day okay we decided to go maybe a little bit this direction and then we get out there in the race and it does exactly what i know its going to do because of how they told me the direction that they went in the car im getting a little bit more confident in voice in telling them what i want done what i want the car to feel like and now its just getting to the point where we can get em to keep going in that direction once i say it
9240221 i said i am going to stay for the day i have a speech i was determined to give
9240222 things were already settling down when she talked to me
9240223 i dont think it was unreasonable for her to continue to travel back
9240224 i am not a glutton for pain and punishment i would have never wanted to travel had i been fully engaged in labor
9240225 looking at the christmas palin family pic her daughter is the one who looks 5 months pregnant
9240226 weve got a woman holding a shotgun mixing up a batch of moose stew defending her sick baby against the predatory demon democrats from the wilds of alaska with her regular joe blue collar husband who works in the oil fields and supplements the family income with fishing all of her children clustering around except the brave young man just out of high school who has volunteered to join bushs war on terra
9240227 i dont think it was unreasonable for her to continue to travel back
9240228 i am not a glutton for pain and punishment i would have never wanted to travel had i been fully engaged in labor
9240229 very privileged to introduce to you the next vice president of the united states governor sarah palin of the great state of alaska
9240230 its hysterical now but at the time it was urgency
9240231 but a lot of it makes you wonder how well anybody in the gop vetted her
9240232 really how many dems have won the wh in the last 28 years can you say one comical
9240233 when palin was a mayor of a small city of 6000 she spent 16 millions of the states funds on building a ice rink that was never completed when it should of cost 2 million
9240234 she came out of nowhere and became governor she approved the biggest budget in the history of the state 2 billion dollars more costly then the last one
9240235 she supported the bridge to nowhere before it came to the national spotlight and then flip flopped on it to keep her name
9240236 she supported giving 600 million dollars to a state run diary farm and then took it over and ran it to the ground is there anything less to expect from the governor of the most socialist state in the usa
9240237 her husband works for bp and she has forwarded him all her emails while she was governor going over laws and proposals to do what is best for big oil
9240238 a couple weeks ago palin said on the notion of being vp i cant decide whether or not im ready for the job until someone tells me exactly what it is a vp does i dont really know at least i hope i can help advance my state and put alaska ahead of everything else
9240239 when asked about the iraq war a mere 2 months ago
9240240 at the end of the day mccain is still mccain people may find him a refreshing maverick or an erratic egotist in either event he marches to his own beat
9240241 on the upside his team did manage to play to the medias love of drama fanning speculation about his possible choices and maximizing coverage of the decision
9240242 on the potential downside the drama was evidently entirely genuine the fact that mccain only spoke with palin about the vice presidency for the first time on sunday and that he was seriously considering lieberman until days ago suggests just how hectic and improvisational his process was
9240243 in the end this selection gives him a chance to reclaim the mantle of a different kind of politician intent on changing washington
9240244 spontaneity with a touch of impulsiveness is one of the traits that attract some of mccains admirers whether its a good calling card for a potential president will depend on the reaction in coming days to what looks for the moment like the most daring vice presidential selection in generations
9240245 being honest i put much of my emphasis on someone who has proudly served and has shown their commitment to america first i would rather support someone who would rather talk about what is good about america as opposed to those who would rather talk about what is bad
9240246 one of the first things you do when youre leaking amniotic fluid is to go get checked out have a doctor examine you to make sure there are no problems with the baby fetal heart monitor maybe even a sonogram but those werent done why sounds to me like she really didnt care about this child she only spoke to her doctor her actions speak louder than words to me
9240247 bush wasnt my first choice and neither was mccain in 2000 as for cheney
9240248 the only thing you can say about those quotes 46 is that they were written by people with only fourth grade english 76
9240249 she supported giving 600 million dollars to a state run diary farm
9240250 will mccain be able to simply un nominate her ala harriet miers or will the gop have to participate in some way if it happens after the convention
9240251 were in a mental recession america is a nation of whiners i wrote the banking laws that brought on this mess
9240252 were thrilled to take part of the nascar foundation blood amp marrow drive
9240253 this is a wonderful event to be involved in and were looking for this years event to be an even bigger success
9240254 it would mean the world to me to have my name on that list of guys who have won championships there
9240255 i am going to try to run like i have all season and try to block the points out of my mind
9240256 you are always going to keep it in your mind a little bit
9240257 the main thing is to try and do what ive been doing this year and not make any mistakes
9240258 you get five bonus points for winning a race so that would be a big help if we both go out there and finish second and third or something like that it would still be fairly close if either one of us get a win saturday it could mean a big swing in the points
9240259 he will be tough to beat i dont want for either one of us to have any bad luck i want us to be able to race it out and see how things turn out
9240260 this was a fun day to have sam millard who was our winning designer and his family out here to see their jdrf car out on the track
9240261 we were on an incredible run right up until the point where we smoked the tires but we just had a little bit too much in it at the transition from concrete to asphalt right around 500 feet but were real happy with our data
9240262 your first run down the race track is kind of a guess to a certain degree of what you need to do to go from a to b
9240263 the good news is that this is indy and youve got five qualifying runs so with that data well be in good shape tomorrow the first run will be warm but tomorrows night run will be cooler and the track will be a lot better
9240264 but were in good shape this is a big race for everyone the u s nationals is the race that you want to win and to have this whole jdrf initiative behind us in this race makes it that much more special

9240275 a good weekend for him for sure im proud of him thats just awesome milwaukee is the asalms version of the daytona 500 to me
9240276 now we need to go to hawkeye downs and have another good run and keep this momentum going
9240277 i like hawkeye track weve run pretty well there in the past so i think troy will have a good run
9240278 josh was fast until the motor started to break up causing the car to slow dramatically
9240279 im very proud of josh he did an excellent job this weekend crew chief don duffle bag udoni and the whole team did an excellent job
9240280 jordan seems like he has no luck at all he qualified 22nd with a last minute chassis change then on lap 30 as hes racing with a pack of cars the motor started to lose power and he had to come in and was done what a disappointment
9240281 again another situation out of his control his luck will change and when it happens you are going to see how good this kid is
9240282 sometimes when mommy and daddy check if my blood sugar is high or low i can feel my heart beating in my finger
9240283 i dont want to feel that anymore so i want jdrf to win and find a cure
9240284 were thrilled weve been able to help sams design come alive on our mustang funny car
9240285 all of us at ford motor company are proud we are the largest corporate supporter of
9240286 to have sam see his design on our racecar for the first time today was just really special
9240287 i am so proud to be a part of this great contest with ford and jdrf and look forward to putting sams design in the winners circle this weekend
9240288 i just want to thank the ford motor company for what they did for jdrf through this design contest
9240289 jdrf is very proud to have the support of ford and are thrilled to see the end result of this contest with sams design on the race car
9240290 we were tight to start and then i was sliding the front end at the end of the race
9240291 i am looking forward to my first trip to duquoin i have never raced there and we didnt get to test but i feel that my experience at springfield a couple weeks ago was a great learning experience i will be able to take what i learned at springfield and apply it to the race this weekend and hopefully capitalize on a good finish for rab racing
9240292 unfortunately we had some bad luck at springfield a couple of weeks ago john wes had never raced on dirt before but now that he has some experience we hope to turn that luck around and i feel confident that we will be a solid contender
9240293 britney deixando est dio de grava o 28 08 08
9240294 britney voltou amo britney vamos dar a ela um pouco de amor porque britney n o consegue amor n o h nada de errado com ela britney ainda n o est aqui v britney
9240295 britney poder cantar na frente da fam lia real da inglaterra

9240300 britney e kevin brigam por causa da carreira dos filhos
9240301 n s j contru mos palcos para britney e muitos outros shows de rock mas este foi de longe o mais elaborado e complicado pois tivemos que contru lo em um prazo muito curto
9240302 o grande desafio foi assegurar que a estrutura n o iria danificar o gramado abaixo dele
9240303 im just really proud of the way the guys on this dei principal financial group team have kept fighting this year
9240304 weve definitely experienced the typical rookie year up and downs but everyones hung tough
9240305 we struggled at michigan but no one got down we just put it behind us we go to bristol and qualify fourth and finish in the top 15 my guys are just incredibly resilient and good to work with and each week it feels like we gain a little more ground
9240306 winning the raybestos rookie of the year was one of my goals at the beginning of the season
9240307 if you look at some of the names of the guys who have won it in the past it is a pretty impressive list it is made up of a group of guys that any driver would want to be associated with hopefully i can add my name to that list
9240308 that has been a goal of this team from day one and it is a goal that we know that if we can continue to keep working hard and learning each week we can accomplish
9240309 after a great weekend at the milwaukee mile we got the news that josh would not be finishing the season in the 54 car
9240310 weve still got three races left on the 2008 asa late model series north schedule its a pretty big disappointment that he cant finish the year
9240311 our season started off bad with josh getting into that big wreck at orp and that took a lot out of the budget
9240312 it put us behind the eight ball right off the bat the team worked hard to get the season turned around and he was doing good finishing every race and was really maturing as a driver
9240313 i wish josh the best of luck in the future and i hope he keeps his head up keeps working hard and some days his dreams will come true
9240314 hes going to be a very good driver very soon
9240315 you need to be scared you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now this is the storm of the century
9240316 what do you think the national guard has been doing for decades during natural disasters
9240317 as callous as it sounds i cant help but root for hurricanes the weather phenomena not the team
9240318 in case you missed civics class the role of the government is first to protect us
9240319 so why does it make fema responsible to resuce people
9240320 people in this country have become so used ot having the government do so much for them
9240321 you can do anything you put your mind to but ill be damned if ill help you or even allow you to have the basic help i would expect in the same situation move somewhere else what you cant afford to you must be lazy stupid on welfare too lazy to go to college
9240322 in terms of an inspirational leader steve jobs is really the best ive ever met hes got a belief in the excellence of products hes able to communicate that
9240323 an incomplete story referencing apple was inadvertently published by bloomberg news at 4 27pm new york time today the item was never meant for publication and has been retracted
9240324 you think im an arrogant expletive who thinks hes above the law and i think youre a slime bucket who gets most of his facts wrong
9240325 wow is about the only word that can come to mind after racing this past weekend at the milwaukee mile
9240326 this was by far one of the nicest facilities we have ever raced at the whole weekend was a new experience for our team as we did not know what to expect
9240327 the first couple of laps around the track i realized how big a mile truly was
9240328 to think that we where on the straight aways as long as it takes us to go around some tracks that was pretty cool
9240329 on the restart a car got to the inside of me and while trying to hold him off on the outside the car hit the marbles and broke loose and we lost about nine spots
9240330 if we could have got another caution just one to get caught back up to the pack i think our finishing result would have been better
9240331 im real excited to go to hawkeye downs we have been building some momentum over the past two weeks
9240332 weve changed our entire setup package thanks to our new crew chief randy albert and i think with just a couple more adjustments it will really start showing with three races to go every position is really important were trying to break into the top 10 in points so well see what happens
9240333 this is an exciting time of the year for short track racing asphalt or dirt
9240334 all over the country the short tracks are the place to be with many starting to wrap up their 2008 season which means that track champions will start to be crowned guaranteed the racing will be exciting the emotions will be high and champagne bottles will be popped open if a fan hasnt been to an asa member track this season now is the time to go
9240335 i will have to say i am not necessarily looking forward to the dirt this weekend
9240336 we qualified and finished eighth at the last one so hopefully we can run well and get out of duquoin with the points lead needless to say cant wait to get back to the asphalt
9240337 we had a pretty good car at milwaukee but the motor let go and we had to drop out so that sucks
9240338 im looking forward to hawkeye downs its a pretty good track for us so hopefully we can get things back on track
9240339 its just the way the season has gone we won at rockford but just about everywhere else weve been weve had problems of some type
9240340 i raced the challenge division race in the other car just to race without worrying about points we qualified and finished 12th so that was ok we were fighting some handling issues but at least i got to race
9240341 winning the award was so overwhelming it has created so much brand awareness for the businesses and has really helped curves go from strength to strength the publicity generated from winning the award has opened so many doors for me in my professional life and has given me confidence to move forward into new areas of business the last year has been so exciting and i look forward to the future and the challenges that lie ahead
9240342 these awards are our opportunity to congratulate and celebrate the young entrepreneurs we are able to support each year they represent some of scotlands most talented and dedicated young people and are a great inspiration despite todays difficult economic climate many young people across scotland are taking up the challenge and committing themselves to managing and building their own businesses as a result they are responsible for creating some of scotlands most successful companies and are contributing not only to their local communities but the nation as a whole
9240343 potato famine is sad fer spud a starchy holocaust was that
9240344 both us presidential hopeful barack obama and running mate joseph biden are descended from shoemakers
9240345 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9240346 the train is leaving the station and he can go along or not if he doesnt get on board now he will be running to catch up this train is starting and its not stopping

9240352 and all this bullshit about did she try and get her exbrother in law fired or what
9240353 so what i know if i was governor i have some in laws that would be history too
9240354 they can be taught at the same time you know
9240355 the feminists are going berserk because it was hillarys right to be the first women in a posiition like that
9240356 she also has shown corruption in government and had them thrown out and that is another worry for the left
9240357 i have more experience to lead and obama is not running for vice president
9240358 dear democratic women please pretend our vp candidate is hillary clinton just forget that shes pro life and against most things democrats stand for
9240359 and sending the senates two most liberal members to the white house might not be the best idea
9240360 the mccain campaign is reveling in the fact that palin is a game changer
9240361 sarah palin left the finances of her town wasilla in tatters when she moved on in 2002 h t xgz
9240362 may not know how to read or speak the english language
9240363 empty suit as the right is fond of calling obama is beating a nationally known figure
9240364 what is it exactly that the vice president does all day
9240365 so how does joe biden fit into the change in washington theme
9240366 do you feel ready to be a heartbeat away from the presidency
9240367 fact she never said she wanted creationism taught in schools contrary to what ultra lefty jonnieboy alter said
9240368 this issue ultimately is about abortion and not live births because if there are children being born alive i at least have confidence that a doctor who is in that room is going to make sure that theyre looked after
9240369 damn nulli must be black too that explains a lot

9240388 a wackadoodle 2nd place beauty queen sidekick with a sweet personality and no other qualifications
9240389 i guess you guys have to knock her for being a female
9240390 she also has more executive experience than your top man with 143 days
9240391 half 51 of all voters do not recognize peter kinder despite holding a statewide office and his long tenure in missouri politics
9240392 i dont like it going someplace you dont know people you dont know
9240393 and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9240394 the problem is there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9240395 i still cant believe it i was playing great and he was playing great too
9240396 people just need to realize when it seems too good to be true it probably is
9240397 dont ever agree to a situation that requires you to send money back to someone
9240398 they say to send the tax payment to someone who has the same last name as the victim that way credit card companies and banks believe they are simply sending money to a family member
9240399 and you should never pay for a prize you won
9240400 you never want a piece of paper in the trash with your name date of birth social security number or anything on it in the trash
9240401 people make a living going through the trash looking for that
9240402 if someone steals your information theyre going to use it
9240403 cancel your debit cards dont wait for your credit card statement if a thief gets a hold of your credit card or any personal information that will allow them to open credit theyre going to use it your credit card could be maxed out in a matter of hours
9240404 bay medical is continually working to improve our quality of care by examining the best practices seen at other facilities and implementing programs here to put those best practices in place
9240405 quality is a major focus of our administration and our board of trustees and we monitor our compliance with these best practices to make sure we maintain that quality and then we set the bar even higher
9240406 lifes but a walking shadow a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing
9240407 i considered staying in for just two more years then asking the governor to appoint someone to finish my term
9240408 so i dont feel so terribly bad being thrown out with the bathwater
9240409 i was instrumental in getting sewers installed in key west when i was mayor
9240410 then in the late 1990s they turned to me to help solve the countys sewer problems
9240411 weve got that beautiful new terminal and its not costing monroe county taxpayers
9240412 its all paid for with federal dollars and passenger fees
9240413 which venue for that voice is yet to be determined
9240414 the contrasts between us and the republicans could not be starker especially on issues that matter to middle class families
9240415 with barack obama in the white house and democrats leading in congress we will lead the charge to revitalize the economy create jobs make college affordable again and enable hardworking americans to pay for gas food utilities and cover the monthly bills
9240416 democrats will continue to fight to lower gas prices as we are doing now in congress even as john mccain and the republicans side with big oil
9240417 i for one cant wait to watch president barack obama with the support of a democratic congress sign into law universal health care that covers every single american
9240418 john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and hes promised tax breaks for the biggest corporations instead of middle class families and in 2008 he still thinks its ok that women arent earning equal pay for equal work
9240419 as hillary clinton aptly stated senator mccain has a lifetime of experience
9240420 that could change tomorrow and the next day and the day after
9240421 it is once again important to restate that it is simply not yet possible to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall
9240422 he told each of the governors that federal officials were monitoring hurricane gustav very closely
9240423 president bush pledged the full support of the federal government
9240424 you could have blue cross and you could have nothing and youll get the same service
9240425 i need beaver pennsylvania i need you to stand up beside me and say now is the time to bring about change in america
9240426 he told each of the governors that federal officials were monitoring hurricane gustav very closely
9240427 president bush pledged the full support of the federal government
9240428 hey natsuko i need you to help me watch my friend go to the bathroom
9240429 minamoto is a loli for one of the dates being naomi
9240430 as a result we do not have a unified synthesis product but a document that promotes a particular narrow perspective on climate science based on the prejudices of the editors
9240431 this comment therefore focuses on one fundamental issue that must be corrected if the report is to have any credibility data integrity problems contaminate the historical record that is the underpinning of the entire report
9240432 the ccsp established a rigorous process for the writing and editing of its reports in order to limit the ability of political appointees to massage the report in desired directions but apparently the ccsp review process has left a gaping hole for a single non governmental non technical non expert to shape the report in politically desirable ways on an issue as high politicized as climate change where bloggers and others are paying close attention the inclusion of a doctored image the cribbing of an old misleading figure and the inclusion of an editors personal views in the guise of a science assessment is remarkable even in a draft for public comment even if the excuse is plain old sloppiness the report is a big fat black eye for the worlds leading climate science program
9240433 to say the least im shocked that ncdcs leadership has changed from being the nations record keeper of weather and climatic data to being what appears to me now as an advocacy group
9240434 if this nation is to develop an effective climate change policy it needs to be grounded on sound science asking the public to comment on documents it has not seen is about as far from the scientific method as one can possibly get the public deserves scientific information if it is to validate this report
9240435 the number of sunspots visible on the sun normally shows an 11 year periodicity and the current sunspot cycle cycle 23 had a maximum in 2001 and is entering a minimum phase with few sunspots currently visible our data show that there are additional changes occurring in sunspots independent of the sunspot cycle and these trends suggest that sunspots will disappear completely such an event would not be unprecedented since during a famous episode from 1645 1715 known as the maunder minimum the normal 11 year periodicity vanished and there were virtually no sunspots visible on the solar surface 1 recent studies of the appearance rate and latitudinal drift of sunspots 2 and of the solar magnetic field 3 predict that the number of sunspots visible in future cycles will be significantly reduced finally the occurrence of prolonged periods with no sunspots is important to climate studies since the maunder minimum was shown to correspond with the reduced average global temperatures on the earth 4
9240436 in the past sea temperatures were obtained from measurements by passing ships in the sea lanes of the world it is only in the past three decades that more accurate data on sea surface temperatures has become available the analysis of this recent data by the author shows that the oceans regulate the composition of the atmosphere the influence on climate of human generated carbon dioxide co2 in the atmosphere is negligible and global climate change has natural causes the oceans and the atmosphere are quite shallow in relation to the vast surface area of the oceans the interaction of the atmosphere and the oceans is essentially a phenomenon of the ocean surface it would be expected that there would be almost a direct correlation between levels of co2 in the air and the global mean sea surface temperatures and that is the case the chart shows that the co2 levels in the atmosphere and global average sea surface temperatures are locked together the correlation is so firm it is reasonable to include it as a condition in the computer simulations used to study climate change global average sea surface temperatures are now starting to fall it is reasonable to contemplate that sea temperatures may gradually decline towards the average of the previous century that would be a drop of about 0 35 c that would mean that atmospheric co2 levels would also similarly decline towards the average of the past century

9240440 im reluctant to go in with a budget that really doesnt meet our needs and have someone force us to cut it further
9240441 it is unfortunate that property tax reductions will not allow keeping employees even with inflation
9240442 it is hoped we can at least keep them a little ahead of their increased health insurance contribution while employee wages will be less than inflation i would remind us that inflation over the past four years was less than wage salary increases realized during those years hopefully employees will remember that and not feel so badly about slipping back some
9240443 right now we just dont have a real good guess
9240444 150 000 if we have a harsh winter is not going to be enough for salt
9240445 their expenses have been higher than their income and we cant afford to give them money for their capital projects out of both the levy and edit funds
9240446 so it could be a couple of years before we see a decrease due to job losses
9240447 during our convention we democrats laid out clear bold solutions to tackle the two biggest challenges confronting our nation economic disarray at home and a decline in american strength and support around the world
9240448 the contrasts between us and the republicans could not be starker especially on issues that matter to middle class families
9240449 with barack obama in the white house and democrats leading in congress we will lead the charge to revitalize the economy create jobs make college affordable again and enable hardworking americans to pay for gas food utilities and cover the monthly bills

9240454 the offshore oil and gas and rocky mountain oil shale development ban days are numbered 35 days and counting to be specific thats because the bans expire at the end of this fiscal year sept 30 and come october there is nothing in current law that prevents green lighting the leasing and exploration process president bush has persistently called on congress to act on drilling but the ball is now in his court not theirs if he pledges to veto an extension of the ban opponents of oil drilling will have no other option but to cave in because veto sustaining blocks in both houses of congress have made their commitment to allowing the ban to end clear in writing
9240455 evidence is presented that the recent worldwide land warming has occurred largely in response to a worldwide warming of the oceans rather than as a direct response to increasing greenhouse gases ghgs over land atmospheric model simulations of the last half century with prescribed observed ocean temperature changes but without prescribed ghg changes account for most of the land warming indeed we find compelling evidence from several atmospheric general circulation model simulations without prescribed ghg aerosol and solar forcing variations table 1 that the continental warming in fig 1a is largely a response to the warming of the oceans rather than directly due to ghg increases over the continents table 2 in summary our results emphasize the significant role of remote oceanic influences rather than the direct local effect of anthropogenic radiative forcings in the recent continental warming
9240456 nghiem said the rapid decline in winter perennial ice the past two years was caused by unusual winds
9240457 unusual atmospheric conditions set up wind patterns that compressed the sea ice loaded it into the transpolar drift stream and then sped its flow out of the arctic
9240458 the winds causing this trend in ice reduction were set up by an unusual pattern of atmospheric pressure that began at the beginning of this century
9240459 a team of nasa and university scientists has detected an ongoing reversal in arctic ocean circulation triggered by atmospheric circulation changes that vary on decade long time scales
9240460 our study confirms many changes seen in upper arctic ocean circulation in the 1990s were mostly decadal in nature rather than trends caused by global warming
9240461 the winter of 2006 2007 was another high arctic oscillation year and summer sea ice extent reached a new minimum
9240462 it is too early to say but it looks as though the arctic ocean is ready to start swinging back to the counterclockwise circulation pattern of the 1990s again
9240463 it is apparent that solar cycle 23 is a long one i agree with jan janssens spotless day derived result of month of minimum being july 2009 if solar cycle 24 is as weak as i think it will be then it will have a slow ramp up much slower than the late 19th century cycles used for comparison this leads to another point solar cycles generally have four years of rise and seven years of decline solar cycle 5 the first half of the dalton minimum had 6 9 years of rise and 5 4 years of decline if solar cycle 24 mimics solar cycle 4 in this way then year of maximum will be 2016 four years after the latest estimate from nasas solar prediction panel each days passing of anaemic solar cycle 24 sunspot activity reinforces the imminent cooling the above graph is for a 13 year solar cycle 23 if it turns out to be 13 6 years that will result in a further 0 4 degree decline

9240467 i dont know how he made that play and to be able to get two outs just leaves me speechless
9240468 i didnt even feel like we had a chance to turn it i ran to third make sure we kept those runners as far from scoring as possible and i gave it a shot at first i just happened to barely get him

9240483 i am not surprised by the way he played today he ran behind his pads he was physical and he is in great condition
9240484 several times i was five or six yards down field before anybody touched me
9240485 i was very proud of the way our offensive line performed
9240486 it was a big confidence boost to get out and perform behind an offensive line that might be a little inexperienced but definitely didnt play inexperienced today
9240487 they played like they had been out there blocking together for the last two or three years
9240488 whenever im on the field i try to make the 10 other guys around me better whether its with the run or the block or whatever

9240498 are there any circumstances under which you would consider suspending the republican convention if the hurricane really bashes that part of the country
9240499 im afraid chris that we may have to look at that situation and well try to monitor it ive been talking to governors jindal louisiana barbour mississippi riley alabama crist florida ive been talking to all of them but you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9240500 we are in communication with the gulf state governors to make sure the convention is taking all the appropriate steps as the hurricane progresses
9240501 the safety of our affected delegations is our first priority and preparing for gustav comes before anything else

9240513 st louis selection from such an impressive group of cities is a testament to the quality of scientific research and development happening in missouri
9240514 its also a unique chance for our regions citizens to have a little fun with science and technology talk to scientists on the cutting edge about what they are doing and why and potentially impact scientific discoveries and policy at a national level
9240515 the festival will present science in a way that many people have never experienced
9240516 events include entertaining subjects like the science of dating and tough and timely issues like stem cell research and climate change it will be real it will be fun but most important the festival provides an opportunity for all of us to be entertained engaged and informed about issues that concern or intrigue us
9240517 highlight the importance of science and technology to our economic development and the positive role it plays in our future
9240518 the st louis region is a perfect choice for this event st louis county believes in the important value of public engagement with science it is in fact critical to participate in the world at large
9240519 washington university faculty students and staff will become engaged in the festival which has great potential to improve the perception of st louis as a great american city for people interested in science
9240520 has my enthusiastic support and we look forward to this collaborative effort among the zmd institutions and the city of st louis
9240521 something that attracted us to this festival is the fact that it strives to make science fun for people of all ages and socio economic backgrounds
9240522 we hope in turn the festival will encourage more people to participate in scientific dialogue and inspire more u s students to pursue science related careers
9240523 this is yet another category where st louis will grow as a destination for ideas
9240524 advances in science and technology are changing our world every day its thrilling to be able to offer this insiders look at what the future might bring
9240525 ideally we should all have a say in what lies ahead

9240531 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9240532 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9240533 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9240534 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9240535 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

9240542 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed

9240977 we ask authorities with all our heart to be more sensitive maybe nothing like this has happened to them or they would be more sensitive
9240978 the most frustrating thing has been the indolence of many of the authorities their insensitivity
9240979 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a

9240986 so right now im just hoping to win my next match
9240987 hes paid his dues i think hes really ready to move forward
9240988 he has the experience and hes had the opportunity to play matches against all kinds of players so i think its now his chance to do it
9240989 won the first set i remember so that was cool
9240990 like the main thing from that match i remember i was playing at 2 p m and i knew espn went on the air at 3 i wanted to make it to 3 to get some espn time which i did hopefully ive gotten a lot better since then he has too
9240991 he has improved a lot and he has that powerful serve

9241015 despite the apparent strength the nato naval group in the black sea is not battle worthy

9241027 i think there should be an adequate reaction by nato to russias incursion
9241028 we are looking forward to the eu council on monday to define a unified position supporting politically and economically georgia and hopefully sending a strong message to russia

9241111 she had not known the weight until she felt the freedom
9241112 a liberdade econ mica capaz de diminuir a desigualdade social de um pa s
9241113 em primeiro lugar preciso definir o que vem a ser igualdade social esse conceito pressup e que todos sejam for ados a viver em casas id nticas ganhar os mesmos sal rios comer as mesmas comidas e acreditar nos mesmos valores essa abordagem totalit ria j foi tentada na uni o sovi tica e est em pleno vigor em cuba os resultados foram e s o desastrosos para n o dizer tr gicos
9241114 as pessoas n o nascem iguais elas possuem habilidades e talentos pr prios cada uma deve decidir sozinha o que quer fazer da vida se prefere tabalhar duro ou levar uma exist ncia mansa e tranquila o principal papel do governo n o ir contra essa realidade e for ar algo que n o existe nem existir o bom governante aquele que oferece oportunidades iguais para todos buscarem a pr pria felicidade o capitalismo promove n veis desiguais de prosperidade como diria o estadista winston churchill isso muito melhor do que produzir mis ria igual para todos como faz o socialismo
9241115 ao dar oportunidade para que a popula o mais pobre prospere a liberdade econ mica boa para todos
9241116 quando por outro lado existe liberdade o poder econ mico n o est sujeito a for as pol ticas e sociais pequenas e m dias companhias privadas que s o a espinha dorsal de uma economia e produzem a maior parcela dos impostos t m melhores chances de crescer a liberdade econ mica uma doutrina revolucion ria que desafia o status quo e os que querem usar o poder em proveito pr prio no longo prazo sua aplica o produz mais prosperidade mais igualdade de renda mais emprego e reduz os n veis de pobreza
9241117 se dividirmos os pa ses do mundo em cinco grupos usando o grau de liberdade econ mica como par metro vemos que o grupo de pa ses mais livres tem uma renda per capita cinco vezes maior que a do grupo de na es que consideramos repressoras o desemprego nos pa ses livres de 6 enquanto nos economicamente repressores de 19 as na es mais livres tamb m possuem menor infla o que sabidamente corr i o sal rio dos mais pobres

9241121 the employee breached the bargain but beyond that it cant be said that the breach has had broader ramifications
9241122 the concept of penalties applying to breaches of industrial instruments is more appropriately directed to those breaches that have a broader economic impact
9241123 we didnt want to turn anybody off with threatening words that no one understands anymore like worship or hymn people in todays society get kind of uncomfortable with too much talk about things like commitment and dedication theyd much rather have a religion that they can turn on or off at will our book seeks to meet that need
9241124 quando se fala que o ex rcito escola da vida n o um mero acaso pois que ali onde saem melhores cidad os que podem servir o pa s em todas as vertentes incluindo no desporto

9241126 muitos destes programas ainda n o foram conclu dos por isso a popula o deve votar na continuidade que o mpla garante para dar lhe sequ ncia nos pr ximos quatro anos

9241150 elite xc does me a favor after i lose by putting me on the first shoxc against edson berto
9241151 elite xc does me a favor after i lose by putting me on the first shoxc against edson berto bertos father is good friends with jareds father gary shaw who wants bertos brother on a boxing contract berto was the next guy elite xc wanted to build but i win that fight and now i am 1 1 elite xc gives me an opportunity to fight diaz elite xc puts me against diaz because elite xcs roster was so light and there was nobody else to fight him elite xc creates a new weight class for diaz because he beat gomi giving diaz a belt and creating a weight division 160 he can make will make your belt legit sorry to ruin elite xcs plans and beat him elite xc never promoted or took care of me as their champion
9241152 in the elite xcs dvd where diaz and i fought there are two 2 baseball cards of diaz and kimbo hello i won the fight and elite xcs promoting diaz after i beat him or how about the day elite xc flew diaz in to do a signing on the dvd where he lost wow that must have been uncomfortable nick signing a dvd and it is a fight that you lost why wasnt i flown in for the signing elite xc has never promoted me on either of their websites elitexc or pro elite elite xc offered me a fight on the first cbs show but only if i signed a new long term contract instead of promoting their best fighters on cbs you have to be on a long term contract for them to promote you that was not our deal
9241153 consider when elite xc gives a couple thousand tickets away at their cbs show in stockton elite xc gives me a hard time about comping me one extra ticket for my cousin that helped me train for my fight i only get four tickets per show i am the main event in honolulu my home town i did not ask for any tickets for my family and friends and they gave me a hard time about one extra ticket or how about when elite xc brought diaz into the ring after my last victory in hawaii to disrespect me and my family
9241154 chuck champion president elite xc threatens me my family and my manager with lawsuits and how hes going to sue me haha pretty hard to sue a guy who does not make jack with your company im glad kala disclosed how much i make which breached the confidentiality clause of the contract i will break down the real numbers for you i am the defending world champ i have been the main event for elite xc three out of four times on showtime in almost two years i have made approximately 83 000 after paying my trainers and managers fee i have 50 000 thousand after taxes probably 30 grand divide that by two years for 15 000 thousand a year divide by 52 weeks that amounts to approximately 300 a week i do not know anybody that can survive on that amount of money my buddies make more money than that in a couple days being a bus boy or bar back and yes you can argue i should fight more elite xc doesnt give me fights or promote me they ice me gary shaw productions only gave me one of the agreed upon four fights per the boxing contract and i do not want to ramble on about all the little small stuff that i can keep going on about but the straw that broke the camels back is they want me to fight diaz for the second time diaz is not the number one contender and they are paying diaz three times more money than me diaz complained after the stockton fight he was not paid enough how do you think that made me feel yes you can argue that diaz gets more for the draw therefore i do not deserve as much compensation if that is the case it is a result of elite xc terrible job promoting me instead of promoting me as their champ and upcoming athlete elite xc has resented me for ruining their plans to make diaz their champ that is just total disrespect so it comes down to money and what is fair i am tired of being bent over by elite xc with no vaseline
9241155 i am right when i say diaz is not the number one contender elite xc is trying to force this fight for their ratings eddie alaverez is the number one contender and anybody with half a brain knows that a fight with eddie is a way harder fight for me than diaz i will fight diaz but elite has to be fair im not ducking diaz why the hell would i be scared of someone i already beat with that being said i am going to focus on my boxing career i can make more money doing 6 and 8 rounders every other month and make more than i did being the elite xc defending world champ at least i will be able to sleep at night and be able to look myself in the mirror everyday that right there is worth more than 300 bucks a week or fighting a guy i cannot stand for less money than him the second time around will the diaz fight happen yes will the fight happen on elite xc on october 4 2008 probably not the way things are being run by chuck champion a guy whose history is newspapers not fighting and kala someone who talks a lot of game but has never put on a pair of gloves never stepped in a ring or cage kala has had everything handed to him with a silver spoon from daddy does anyone else but me think kala just wants to be famous and stir up all this dirty laundry i guess any publicity is good publicity when i think about it it has been good promotion for their october card since nobody is talking about it until you bring up the noons vs diaz match up

9241335 do you begin to see then what kind of world we are creating it is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic utopias that the old reformers imagined a world of fear and treachery and torment a world of trampling and being trampled upon a world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself progress in our world will be progress toward more pain

9241340 i would just like to remind everyone that this time last year we of course didnt have a peace process and perhaps its well to go back to when president george w bush came to office in 2001 in the midst of the breakdown completely of the peace process with the second intifada underway with the election of prime minister sharon who explicitly did not come to power intending to be a part of the peace process
9241341 president bush has worked tirelessly over the last seven years of his administration to lay a foundation for this peace process

9241382 die erfreuliche gesch ftsentwicklung im zweiten quartal konnte die schwierigen ersten drei monate des jahres ausgleichen
9241383 die entwicklung der einzelnen ertragsquellen zeigt dass wir im operativen kundengesch ft gut unterwegs sind
9241384 die lbbw hat in den vergangenen sechs monaten entscheidende meilensteine erreicht
9241385 die finanzmarktkrise hat nochmals verdeutlicht dass unsere schon lange vorher eingeleitete weichenstellung zum ausbau des kundengesch fts strategisch richtig ist dass es zu einem kundenorientierten gesch ftsmodell f r landesbanken keine alternative gibt zeigen die erfahrungen der kleineren institute sachsen lb und lrp mit geringem kunden und gro em kreditersatzgesch ft mit der integration beider banken demonstriert die lbbw ihre wirtschaftliche st rke
9241386 vielf ltige gut ausbalancierte ertragsquellen die konservative risikopolitik und die solide kapitalausstattung sind die erfolgsfaktoren an denen die lbbw weiterhin festhalten wird auch zuk nftig werden sowohl organisches als auch anorganisches wachstum m gliche handelsoptionen darstellen
9241387 ich habe jeden einzelnen der 11 900 kilometer der tour aus eigener kraft auf dem fahrrad bew ltigt
9241388 ich hatte eine fahrradzeitung in der hand gehabt und von der tour gelesen zwei wochen sp ter musste mein fr herer arbeitgeber insolvenz anmelden dann war f r mich sofort klar dass ich daran teilnehme
9241389 ich war marathonl ufer und habe das rad lediglich als ausgleich benutzt
9241390 mein ziel war die tour als expedition zu fahren und nicht als rennen auf zeit schlie lich m chte ich ja auch mitbekommen was um mich herum alles sehenswertes ist
9241391 einmal bin ich au erdem mit starken magenkr mpfen gefahren dies h tte mich fast den efi status gekostet allerdings war f r den n chsten tag ein ruhetag eingeplant so dass ich mich durchgek mpft hatte
9241392 von deutschland sollte er salztabletten mitbringen und nahm versehentlich tabletten f r den gebissreiniger mit au erdem hatte er damenhandschuhe anstatt herrenhandschuhe und winterfahrradsocken dabei

9241396 einerseits bin ich stolz dass ich es geschafft habe andererseits spielt auch schwermut mit dass ich die ganzen leute nicht mehr sehen kann
9241397 der reiz des neuen fehlt dann allerdings werde ich bestimmt wieder nach afrika fliegen

9241413 man muss schon sagen dass die mannschaft den trainer im stich gelassen hat in der halbzeit hatte ich nicht das gef hl dass noch mal ein aufb umen bei den spielern da ist
9241414 wir haben jetzt zwei wochen zeit das vern nftig zu konsolidieren und werden zu einem guten ergebnis kommen
9241415 das dfb pokalspiel gegen hertha bsc berlin hat gezeigt dass die mannschaft potenzial hat f r eine einstellungs nderung gibt es methoden es muss nur jemand her der diese einstellung f rdert das ist sicherlich nicht erst jetzt angereift sondern in den letzten drei spielen der schl ssel zur motivation ist nicht gefunden worden
9241416 wir waren alle der meinung dass ein schnitt her muss wir m ssen sehen dass wir einen anderen geist in die mannschaft rein bekommen

9241509 please pray for us inhabitants of the gulf coast please if you have a blog post asking for prayers 3 years after katrina and rita we are still rebuilding we need help pray please for cameron lake charles new orleans etc we need prayers
9241510 please god let me know that going public wasnt a futile gesture on my part tell me my sense of righteousness didnt get in the way of my better judgment tell me that the publicity surrounding this suit wont make things worse for my son let me know there is a purpose to this mortifying charade that has torn my family my community and me apart most of all lord let me that my son will be all right
9241511 the lord has seen fit to answer your prayers and ease your pain you will learn shortly that there is a special place for those who use god and his church to desecrate children for the lord holds children close to his heart woe upon the man who masquerades as a priest in order to fill his own lusty desires with children he has a special place in hell as do all those who aid him in his crimes innocence has brought you to us so that we may put your mind at ease
9241512 will i learn exactly what becomes of these monsters and more importantly to those who allow it to continue
9241513 it is here that we will find the priests who have violated children over the centuries
9241514 it wasnt time the comedy was written to legitimize the church not offend it
9241515 in the name of god most high and holy i command you move aside and let us see the most prized of your souls
9241516 because their acts were such abominations that next to satan himself no single group has driven more people from god than sexually abusive clergy
9241517 someone who is trying to thwart their work on earth and it is heavens desire that he see the punishment which lies in wait for those who commit these atrocities the lord wishes man to know that regardless of the outcome of the earthly courts there is one court of justice that cannot be escaped
9241518 if your right eye causes you to sin then gouge it out
9241519 but i did this to save the church the church is more important than a few children i was doing gods work i didnt know they were serial molesters think of the scandal it was consensual you dont understand how difficult a priests life is children of satan were seducing my priests priests are only human think of all the money i saved the church and think of all the good i have done with that money
9241520 this is my favorite part i just love the good intentions speech
9241521 thank you my friends for destroying the innocence of children youve planted the seeds of fear and distrust in their hearts for with fear and distrust burned into a heart it is almost impossible to accept the idea of a loving god

9241523 as the massive boeing 777 jet accelerated down the runway then lifted into the air i was again in awe at the magnificent power that would lift such immense weight to a cruising altitude of more than 43 000 feet as the plane entered an area of turbulence and the giant machine was tossed about as though it weighed nothing i was reminded of the tremendous awe inspiring force of the one who is the source of all power we witness gods power in so many areas and ways as we journey through this world in the roaring of mighty waterfalls the glories of a sunrise the churning of the seas the birth of our babies we witness his ultimate power in our own lives in our own personal experiences as we come to know him as the one who cares for and loves us individually and unconditionally he knows and cares about every difficulty we face and each heartbreak we suffer it is difficult to understand how such a powerful god who rules the universe would care for us on a personal basis we must come to understand that god does not allow his work of keeping all things in the universe in its proper place to divert his attention from us personally nor does it interfere with his working in our individual lives
9241524 though we travel the world over to find the beautiful we must carry it with us or we find it not

9241791 for a while now science has been converging with common sense catching up at last with experience confirming a widespread suspicion that things are far more connected than traditional physics ever allowed the holographic universe is an elegant affirmation of this process a lifeline that helps to bridge the artificial gap that has opened up between mind and matter between us and the rest of the cosmos
9241792 we desperately need new models of reality to fire the imagination of what is possible and to give us new visions of our place in the cosmos michael talbots the holographic universe does this it is a wake up call to wonder an adventure in ideas if you need to maintain your idea that science has proved that its all mechanical that there is no room in the universe for consciousness soul and spirit dont read this book
9241793 the concept of the universe as a giant hologram containing both matter and consciousness as a single field will i am sure excite anyone who has asked the question what is reality this book may answer that question once and for all

9241804 missbethd i really really really dont like taco hell but others love it i just cant do it
9241805 thinking of putting wichita lineman on the ipod shush i like it
9241806 so what do you think of mccains choice of vp
9241807 so my son told me that mccain left a wife in a wheelchair to marry cindy mccain but thats just information from a teenager
9241808 shouldnt women be flattered that the republicans think the female vote is so valuable its worth choosing someone totally unqualified as their vp candidate just to court women
9241809 im dealing with a very difficult very personal issue and i know this is not the solution
9241810 oh my god i have been told that im hideous not to bond girl standard that the only reason im working is because i must be shagging someone in the industry ive read that everywhere at first i was like im an actress i went to drama school i did theatre im serious and then you go ah its some fat t with no life who wrote that so they can sod off ill just do my work which i seem to be getting and see what happens
9241811 i thought is it an art project or does she like my top
9241812 and she giggles in a way that can only be described as wicked with echoes of her gravesend council estate upbringing in england
9241813 no there are similarities but ive got too much of a sense of humour poor old tess doesnt have much of a laugh she doesnt think things through she just feels them and im like that i dont rationalise i just feel i suppose if i had been born 150 years ago it might have been into the same sort of life theres a similar background normal family life not middle class i look after my family ive always been quite a mothering person and tess is like that more than similarities in character i think there are similarities in the way i operate as a person and the way i think and feel but i cant really pin them down shes much more restrained and shy and gentle she laughs again im more abrupt shall we say
9241814 shes simple as you like shes a pure straightforward girl who grows into a woman with simple ideas and simple goals and thats really attractive people come along and chip away at her life but she still keeps this sense of strength and dignity about doing the right thing for her family her baby and her love
9241815 when i first read the script i thought i dont know if i can do that because ive never been raped and millions have
9241816 if you dont feel dead and desolate and young and vulnerable doing that scene the audience is just watching an actor trying to make themselves cry
9241817 i thought now i can show everybody i can act
9241818 although in bond my characters cool shes not a typical bond girl shes funny and real and someone you could know from down the road im quite tough i have to arrest bond at one point but i go to bed with him of course so it is a good part
9241819 but more than anything its so that my grandkids can say their gran was a bond girl
9241820 by going to morocco and escaping from it all im going to be in the depths of the souk in a hut
9241821 all the reviews will come out and ill be in a hut because i read every review i cant help myself ive read so many bad ones now people saying such horrible things about me as a person
9241822 oh my god i have been told that im hideous not to bond girl standard that the only reason im working is because i must be shagging someone in the industry ive read that everywhere at first i was like im an actress i went to drama school i did theatre im serious and then you go ah its some fat t with no life who wrote that so they can sod off ill just do my work which i seem to be getting and see what happens
9241823 it was just this big rocknroll sing along that wed always play before we went out
9241824 i think what guy has achieved is that hes got all the elements that people love about the novel pride and prejudice or even the bbc adaptation of it but then hes dealt it this very witty twist hes kept all the nostalgia all the affection you have for mr darcy and elizabeth but then hes made it up to date and punchy and interesting
9241825 these great big lavish costume dramas are our favourites because they get more money spent on them they have great casts lovely scripts and high production values
9241826 but weve seen all that we saw it years ago and now everythings just another remake whats nice about this is that youve got characters you know and love but in completely different circumstances
9241827 i think i was a bit young to quite get it but i pretended i did but he is brilliant in it and i still watch it
9241828 i just know that if i walk into an audition i wont look right
9241829 its not like i think im a hideous troll or anything its just a question of not being the most beautiful a lot of it is decided as you walk through the door ive got a lot of very beautiful young friends who are doing very well and i know if i was a director and they walked through the door id be like wow yeah
9241830 being the lead and being in every single scene is not something ive done before
9241831 because the couple of jobs i did when i was 16 were very serious dramas where i was playing heroin addicts and stuff like that they were heavy issues and thats what i assumed i was good at and could do
9241832 that environment was an incredible one in which to make television because you could have a lot of input if you wanted it and there was a couple of us who did
9241833 so through ideas i had which were just stuff that came naturally we all started getting a bit zany then they started writing for that and nicki became a completely different character she turned into a bit of a clown which was also the sort of human being i was growing into
9241834 i once got a text message from a friend in new york saying ive just seen your face on a bus in times square
9241835 because of the britishness of it and because of the subject matter it just filled that little hole that buffy fans wanted filling
9241836 being fed a lot of chit chat all the time it gets exhausting after a while and i got embarrassed to say i was an actor because everybody is an actor everyones got a script for you to read its sounds like a clich but its really true
9241837 and if you want to make a career over there or youre aiming to get work you have to be there the whole time my agent and i kind of fell out over that because i was always running back home
9241838 and im not a lesbian this time which is a nice change
9241839 leaving the baby in the bushes like that if the baby hadnt been found it probably wouldnt have survived for long
9241840 it was a game of hide and go seek that turned into a day of reckoning
9241841 they made it very clear that this storm could be as bad as it gets
9241842 we could see flooding even worse than we saw in hurricane katrina
9241843 i felt that we were good friends i could go in there and chat 15 20 minutes no problem
9241844 she straightened things out here shes not afraid a bit what she thinks is right she is going to do
9241845 she has that aura i think she will be mccains ace in the hole
9241846 she seems to speak her mind which could get a person in trouble in that position
9241847 would you let anyone speak to your sister that way
9241848 do you think that just because im a foreigner that kind of behavior is appropriate
9241849 yo billy watsa matta with you youre shaking so much youre making me nervous
9241850 i think thats dawn hedgegood we did her and her husband the other night

9241981 i could hear the excitement in his voice and it reminded me of those butterflies youd get starting school as a kid
9241982 ci sono trenta persone che lavorano con me perci parlo della nostra cucina perch soltanto con la loro collaborazione con lo scambio di vedute con il contributo di altre idee e altre braccia ho potuto sviluppare il mio obiettivo che dare emozioni attraverso il cibo certo e non mi sembra n assurdo n presuntuoso affermare che con i nostri piatti riusciamo a dare emozioni perch una pietanza non solo quello che viene servito in tavola e si mangia di ogni piatto posso elencare gli ingredienti indicare modi e tempi di cottura ricordare lorigine di ciascun prodotto impiegato ma non ne avr esaurito la descrizione ci sono le sensazioni che vanno molto al di l degli ingredienti e del procedimento della ricetta
9241983 per cucina cerebrale per non intendo una cucina finta astratta bens una cucina che nasce dai sensi ma rielaborata con la testa per esempio quando inventiamo un piatto nuovo lo facciamo a partire da ricordi lontani o vicinissimi ieri ho assaggiato una susina cotta e anche se sembra strano dirlo il suo sapore mi rimasto in testa ho registrato delle sensazioni e so che prima o poi le elaborer con laiuto dei miei collaboratori e ne far una ricetta come accaduto non troppo tempo fa per un ricordo gustativo che serbavo da tanto da piccolo i miei amici mi hanno fatto mangiare per scherzo dellanguria con il sale il gusto si era impresso nella memoria e quasi a mia insaputa rimasto l fino a quando ne nata languria impanata con alghe essiccate ci sono le sensazioni saline e zuccherine di quel ricordo interpretate in modo diverso
9241984 magari di una nocciola mi colpisce lo scricchiolare sotto i denti di un pezzo di carne la consistenza e il colore e poi ci sono ispirazioni olfattive di incredibile potenza come il cappero che un concentrato micidiale di profumi oltre che di sapori mediterranei ecco che il percorso creativo sempre giocato su diversi sensi
9241985 ci sono anche tentativi che finiscono in un archivio da dove giusto non tirarli pi fuori
9241986 da ragazzo quando facevo le prime esperienze professionali la odiavo la maionese impazziva luovo rimanendo del tempo sul vassoio degli antipasti si ossidava e poi inacidiva facilmente senza contare che era pesante poi sono stato a lavorare allestero e intanto la cucina era cambiata eppure quando tornai in italia per aprire il ristorante a milano passavo davanti alla vetrina della famosa gastronomia peck dove cera sempre un gran vassoio di insalata russa e pensavo possibile che sia ancora in voga linsalata russa ogni giorno la vedevo e il mio cervello registrava fino a che ho capito non volevo abolirla ma cambiarla in fondo se col tempo evolvono i gusti anche i piatti possono devono cambiare dopo tante prove nella nostra cucina quindi nata linsalata russa caramellata in piccoli bocconi da mangiare con le mani al primo morso croccante poi il dolce sottile strato di caramello aromatizzato con capperi essiccati e polverizzati esalta la piccola quantit di insalata non abbiamo inventato i sapori n il caramello n linsalata russa ma li abbiamo messi insieme in modo inedito la sorpresa per chi la assaggia la prima volta che riconosce il gusto i sapori familiari eppure non li aveva mai provati cos questo per noi importante ci non vuol dire che le nostre proposte piacciano a tutti ci sta che qualcuno non apprezzi ma limportante lonest quando i cuochi sono onesti c una parte di loro e della loro storia in ogni piatto e la gente lo capisce
9241987 sarebbe bello anche se di difficilissima attuazione perch i clienti hanno esigenze diverse non avere un menu ed essere quindi pi liberi di seguire totalmente il mercato e lavorare giorno per giorno col meglio offerto dai fornitori le triglie fantastiche che mi ha portato ieri un pescatore di fiducia sar impossibile averle uguali domani e tra una settimana ecco vorrei poter seguire ogni giorno i prodotti del momento servendo leccellenza irripetibile

9241992 we had a little bit of everything we started the first match against toledo with good energy struggled a bit from self inflicted issues against a tough xavier team and found that we can bounce back with this win tonight
9241993 you tend to learn more about yourself after a loss because you ask more questions it is good to see this young team can come back after a tough loss and put together a good match
9241994 it was good to see kaila find her rhythm today
9241995 she had a little trouble yesterday so it was nice to see her bounce back and come out aggressive today
9241996 we play back to back matches in the morning and at night against three top 25 teams and in two different time zones
9241997 its going to be a good trip for this young team to learn from well make sure we are getting the rest we need while also taking time to have fun and bond as a team
9241998 one day her hand will be as big as mine and i will forget what it was like to hold such a tiny hand in my own

9242000 do you want to see mommys princess dress its in the attic
9242001 at first glance hes not that cute but his look is quite enduring
9242002 so outrageous in character and extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency so as to be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in civilized society
9242003 weve been using them for 10 years in the united states and they have a proven effectiveness in increasing yields in lowering the use of fertilizer in providing better water and soil management and also increasing taste and appearance so you know those are all good things
9242004 perhaps the biggest issue raised by these results is how to explain the rapid adoption of gm crops when farm financial impacts appear to be mixed or even negative
9242005 bear testimony to the success of this technology and the benefit that farmers derive from it
9242006 please please my little girl is only 12 just turned 12 and she is dying the doctors can do nothing and i have heard that you can heal please come to her if you will not there is no hope
9242007 there are hundreds of people pressing all around us and you want to know who touched you there is no time for this my daughter is dying if we dont get back soon it will be too late
9242008 master the crowds surround you and press in on you
9242009 now jesus will see how foolish this is and we can continue on
9242010 someone touched me for i noticed that power had gone out from me
9242011 i have been bleeding i have not been able to do many of the things i used to do so many times i have wanted to be in the temple to worship and i couldnt because i was unclean i have spent all i have on doctors but not one has been able to help me then i heard about you people said that you were able to heal
9242012 i knew that you would be coming today i saw you in the boat
9242013 i had to try i had to try to reach you but but i am i was unclean i am i was not allowed to be in a crowd for fear that i would defile those around me there were people surrounding you everywhere so i stood back and watched you get out of your boat i thought if i could only touch you even just your robe i might be healed so i dropped to my hands and knees and crawled through the crowd then i reached out for you my fingertips only brushed against edge of your robe and immediately i knew the bleeding had stopped i only touched the tassel of your robe and the thing that had plagued me for twelve years the thing that no doctor could cure was stopped in an instant i tried to crawl back out of the crowd when i heard you calling for the one who had touched you and i knew it had to be me
9242014 daughter your faith has made you well go in peace
9242015 your daughter is dead do not trouble the teacher any longer
9242016 he said he would heal her he said he was coming why did we have to stop we could have made it in time
9242017 do not fear only believe and she will be saved
9242018 do not weep for she is not dead but sleeping
9242019 give her something to eat and tell no one what happened

9242029 they are more bloodthirsty they make their victims disappear they mutilate them they cut their ears off just as in the case of my daughter we do not know where she is
9242030 the message is get to work or well hold you accountable were angry
9242031 major catastrophic events are likely to stimulate and rekindle debate on the issue
9242032 but the two candidates for president seem to have different views on the issue so that influences potentially what would happen
9242033 these legislative changes could cost the federal government some 140 billion to 161 billion in 2009 197 billion to 230 billion in 2013 and 278 billion to 332 billion in 2017

9242040 vamos a evaluar la parte legal vamos a evaluar la parte de inteligencia y veremos si es necesario o no si es necesario todav a tomar otro tipo de acciones de control y de protecci n del estado y de los bolivianos frente a estos min sculos grupos

9242065 no one knows whether sarah palin could be a competent president which shows how highly political and potentially reckless this choice is
9242066 she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant
9242067 republicans rightfully have criticized the democratic nominee sen barack obama for his lack of experience but palin is a neophyte in comparison
9242068 governor palins lack of experience especially in national security and foreign affairs raises immediate questions about how prepared she is to potentially succeed to the presidency
9242069 senator mccain has not only succeeded in unifying our party but also in generating great enthusiasm

9242113 i think the purpose to a full life is to strive to be first water we have to be the purest that we can be in everything we do we cant let the sediments of life color our opinions feelings or zest for happiness
9242114 ive been training and i feel good i feel strong and healthy im motivated to continue my career
9242115 i felt good about the way things worked out last year when i filled in for an injured kicker down in jacksonville then i finished the season with kansas city and things worked out well i felt confident if i continued to train and hope i would get some more opportunities here in 2008
9242116 if you want to buy a fucking potato you have to barter for 45 minutes
9242117 i felt the difference in the game was who would rush the ball better
9242118 we wanted to wear them down and we wanted to wear them out we didnt do it by much but im telling you a one point difference in any sporting event makes a huge difference
9242119 we felt coming into the game that it would be like that and in the second half we didnt have good enough field position to make plays
9242120 i think they might have started getting a little worn out by the end there
9242121 our guys were kind of getting momentum and we were running the ball great
9242122 for a man who is 72 years old and has had four bouts with cancer to have chosen someone so completely unqualified to become president is shockingly irresponsible suddenly mccains age and health become central issues in the campaign as does his judgment
9242123 for months the mccainiacs have said they will run on his judgment and experience in his first presidential decision john mccain has shown that he is willing to endanger his country potentially leaving it in the hands of someone who simply has no business being a heartbeat away from the most powerful complicated difficult job in human history
9242124 the more i think about it the more shocked i am
9242125 you wouldnt hand that responsibility over to somebody you had only met once he is now entrusting the fate of 300 million families 300 million people not to mention three million people in the armed services to her based on one meeting its astonishingly reckless i know he wants the political pop from it i guess thats his calculation but theres no reasonable responsible person who would make a decision that consequential on so little personal knowledge
9242126 continued high fuel prices weak freight demand and escalating operating costs as well as tight credit markets
9242127 regrettably it was more politics as usual from rep kuhl
9242128 on july 24 of this year randy kuhl voted against the use it or lose it consumer energy supply act of 2008 which would have released 10 percent of the strategic oil reserve for consumer use this would have lowered and stabilized gas prices within a matter of weeks
9242129 the use it or lose it policy is already the law of the land and speaker nancy pelosi and majority leader steny hoyer know it
9242130 the fact is that the congressman supports suspending shipments to the strategic petroleum reserve and sent a letter to the president urging him to suspend shipments of oil to the strategic petroleum reserve and allow more oil to remain on the market
9242131 your television ads keep saying things that are not true and you have refused to accept my proposals to have a debate
9242132 we have said publicly when we can arrange our schedule we will meet were not going to do it on your demands

9242134 he sees things from a different perspective than other people
9242135 he communicates well with the players i respect him we really have shared a lot of things together im just happy he got the opportunity of being a manager one more time
9242136 its rough because they have been hanging around here for a whole year we have to face that what happened last year
9242137 we realized that when we lost games we shouldnt have lost
9242138 there have always been some critics who have looked at one thing that happened with the giants it honestly even started in free agency when we lost the guys on defense
9242139 we couldnt really care less those are the same people that last year told us we wouldnt do anything we wouldnt make it to the playoffs and we wouldnt do what we did in the super bowl
9242140 there was always this ominous cloud on the horizon knowing we might not play the season
9242141 we were used to winning and then to lose in the last minutes you can imagine what that was like
9242142 we just felt that because we had done what we did wed be back at the super bowl the next year it was a heck of a run we had but it could have easily been longer and better
9242143 we just felt like it was one of those things where we would always go back there we were going to be a perennial team that goes to the playoffs
9242144 in the modern nfl its kind of not like that its year to year you can go from the top of the league to the bottom knowing that i think our team is going to approach the season a lot differently
9242145 i hate perfume perfume is too often an ethereal corset trapping everyone in the same unnatural shape a lazy and inelegant concession to fashionable ego too often a substitute for true allure and style an opaque shell concealing everything revealing nothing a childish masque hiding the timid and unimaginative an arrogant slap in the face from across the room people who smell like everyone else disgust me perfume is a veil that reveals the soul perfume is the fanfare of our individuality sounding differently to everyone who listens perfume is a signpost to our true selves a different journey for the brave to travel perfume is the weather of our inner world bringing life to a personal landscape perfume is an art that shows us who we can be if we dare an invisible portrait of who we are perfume is discovered fully only by our lovers when we are together naked i encourage you to be yourself expand yourself and please yourself allow yourself the luxury of your own vision perfume is an adventure i encourage you to explore i love making perfume i love being a perfumer
9242146 matt and hank are both guys that ive had a long relationship with both here and in new england ive known them a long time it was hard

9242148 its unique its different but all four of them are guys that we like
9242149 he was just trying to get me to come at first but once we knew the deal was going to be done he wouldve liked a two year commitment

9242153 im thinking way to get my ass out the door
9242154 i mean thats the craziest thing i ever heard of
9242155 but we felt like look theres a lot going on with our team and his situation so lets get up here lets get settled lets get into the new building lets get established lets go one year at a time and move forward in a true partnership
9242156 jesse never tested positive for a steroid or any other performance enhancing drug
9242157 near the end of last season the league claimed he had a diuretic in his system that they said could also be used as a masking agent after spending great time and money defending his innocence the league made its final ruling and now jesse has no choice but to look ahead to week 5
9242158 hes disappointed and so am i but i look forward to him being able to come back and contribute
9242159 first of all i dont really guarantee thats not the business im in but i fully fully fully anticipate kellen being on the roster on opening day unless something earth shattering happens
9242160 im disappointed chatman is disappointed my experience with jesse since he has been a new york jet has been positive he had a good training camp im looking forward to him coming back to contribute
9242161 what i can say is ill have a definitive update on monday
9242162 its always disappointing but its a program that the league has set up and something that i understand and jesse understands the consequences of
9242163 jesse has had a very good training camp and really punctuated it with his game against the eagles hes disappointed and so am i but i look forward to him being able to come back and contribute
9242164 never tested positive for a steroid or any other performance enhancing drug
9242165 near the end of last season the league claimed he had a diuretic in his system that they said could also be used as a masking agent
9242166 after jesse spent great time and money defending his innocence the league made its final ruling and now he has no choice but to look ahead to week 5
9242167 i respect the program the league has in place and its very clear that if theres a violation there are consequences
9242168 my experience with jesse since hes been a new york jet has been extremely positive i think hes done everything weve asked him to do
9242169 tony richardson has run the ball in the past and wide receiver can be used back there as well so well definitely have alternatives in place
9242170 had this not gone through he would be on the 53 man roster
9242171 in terms of evaluating him as a player and a contributor i think he earned that spot from that perspective

9242177 the latest dumb suggestion from australias favourite prefect julie bishop is for university graduates to start teaching in schools without any educational qualifications
9242178 serve as a serious signal to those who try to turn black into white
9242179 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
9242180 mr smith stated that australia respects the territorial integrity of georgia and believes that russia should abide by ceasefire arrangements and return to the positions they occupied before the conflict began
9242181 moscow alleges that there atrocities were meted out on the south ossetian population russia or south ossetia must document whether this is the case and to what extent
9242182 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one
9242183 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships
9242184 any attempts to jeopardise this atmosphere of cooperation would not only have a negative impact for russia but will definitely harm the economic interests of those states
9242185 it will shock many canadians to think of our soldiers who are amongst the best trained in the world to be sent down to the u s to work with a private war making company that has been indicted in some of its operations in iraq in the past
9242186 kbr has not seen the lawsuit so it is premature for us to comment at this time the safety and security of all employees and those the company serves remains kbrs top priority the company in no way condones or tolerates unethical or illegal behavior
9242187 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
9242188 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
9242189 we try and keep our industry out of politics and into marketing opportunities but sometimes its very difficult to separate the two
9242190 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
9242191 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
9242192 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
9242193 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
9242194 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
9242195 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
9242196 the participants underscore the need for respect of the historical and cultural traditions of each country and each people and for efforts aimed at preserving the unity of the state and its territorial integrity
9242197 support the active role of russia in promoting peace and cooperation in the given region
9242198 the soviet union was not so alone even in 1968

9242201 this is something that i caught onto just before 2002 when there was so much research and exploration going around concerning the human colon and digestive system working in harmony with nutritional absorption and i started doing independent studies just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after seeing some fantastic results
9242202 truly unlocked the keys to permanent fat loss they may actually suffer the same fate as jfk

9242218 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too

9242231 calls for the dispatch of additional osce observers to the security zone and setting up an impartial monitoring of the acts of the georgian government
9242232 the russians have checkpoints and we still cannot bring these people back home the threat of paramilitary irregulars looting and robbing is still very high
9242233 apparently the russian military are not willing to prevent these kinds of cases
9242234 but we expect certain sanctions which wont be against the people but against the political elite
9242235 agreed on the need to put an end to attempts to use the situation surrounding georgia to raise tensions in europe by speculating on non existent threats concerning other post soviet countries
9242236 organizing a celebration of peace and sport in an area near where there was a massacre and a war of aggression seems to me to be a strange idea
9242237 i still dont know why were bothering wasting our power here
9242238 its my job which i do whether or not its a tough call
9242239 for the first time in this run that will be a good thing i will make certain of that
9242240 i dunno maryl savans doing the talking but i think theyre both up to something
9242241 i expected someone at least old enough to shave a full beard
9242242 weve had a full drive failure due to a radiation leak in our holds three quarters of the ship are sealed off
9242243 radiation that wouldnt happen to be salicite radiation would it
9242244 i wonder what kind of dealer would trade out salicite without ore casings unless there werent any to be had need the casings to seal the cargo right sure they could get a few light years maybe to the next station to see if they had some casings to spare but without proper holds theyd never get back to ulinas with that much radioactivity melting through unprotected bulkheads even with the right holds theyd have some damage but everyone knows you dont have the right holds
9242245 do you remember picking up casings at irtrin maybe we can lend them a few
9242246 i think youre aware of our cargo and our dealings
9242247 so lets quit the game im trying to avert a core overload and as much as i dont want your help im asking for it
9242248 you cant carry it as it is and even if you do make it to ulinas its likely they wont take it because itll be half rotted by the time you get there
9242249 but if you want to breach on top of all that thats your choice
9242250 how much does a half smashed nacelle go for on the open market
9242251 thats enough to buy some more deuterium and me a bottle of real scotch
9242252 any way we look at it we win thatll be nice for a change
9242253 since im new in the circuit you might need a hint at this point i dont give a damn if you give me your cargo or not ive got nothing left to lose in watching your ship blow to chunks and collecting debris when the sparks sizzle down nothing left to lose at all so you can do whatever the hell you want ill still be flying away
9242254 youd love any block of soil wed to land on after the last few months
9242255 no way this place beats the hell out of minjau any day
9242256 now if only we can actually get it to do that
9242257 come on enjoy yourself its not often we land on a planet with actual civilization
9242258 how little its changed my father brought me here once when i was a boy my sisters and i played in that park over there when he was in the conference
9242259 little wonder you got into all that because your father was in it too
9242260 hana and i well weve struggled before especially in the beginning when we were really young she was still a fugitive and i didnt have the means to pay both our ways for a while that was a rough time cardies like to keep their assets and their reputations in check you know anyway wed have gotten out of here altogether but she couldnt leave her family far behind yeah that was rough but this really isnt looking good either its sad but i like it here i dont want to lose what weve managed to make
9242261 i know you took a chance on me and i appreciate you standing up and trying me out but ive never been interested in command and i dont have that many connections in this part of space only bills
9242262 not to mention you hate the fact you got bamboozled into this in the first place
9242263 nah dont worry about it you never asked for this i dont blame you but if you get any snap ideas trust me ill be willing to hear it anythings better than listening to livich bitch and moan all day and night
9242264 well find a way out of this hanas good at what she does knows darned well how to dig well figure it out you just keep us flying and well get through it i just cant help but think sometimes about if worse comes to worse you know
9242265 yeah well im already there if you need any pointers ill be glad to show you around
9242266 you really are in a bad space arent you tom
9242267 nothing more unqualifies a man to act with prudence than a misfortune that is attended with shame or guilt
9242268 an old earth saying a friend of mine had a list of them tacked up in her quarters she loved to read
9242269 but i am anyway youre too young to have to think like that
9242270 well there wasnt an age requirement just the way things turned out not as if i didnt have it coming hell i should have known id end up out here the way i used to be
9242271 look me up sometime trust me they had no problem going public with it
9242272 i mean it maryl i wasnt raised here and as much as i used to hear about the trade circuit i never understood how much went into it hell all ive done here the past half year is fly peoples stuff around i didnt learn anything but how to fly really old ships
9242273 and you were born and raised on earth i guess we cant expect you to get used to the way it is out here right away but if you stay whether its on our ship or somewhere else youll eventually have to this isnt a playground life can be tough on the border and it takes a lot of work to get us from place to place
9242274 i dont mind the work i like that part of it actually
9242275 i dont want to be in the position to repeat that
9242276 sounds like youre no better than the rest of us
9242277 im afraid we hadnt stockpiled but a small amount of salicite captain its not common on this side of the route after all weve been out for a week and dont expect a shipment for another quarter
9242278 so lets play some catch up you say you have no salicite ore but you carried it when did you run out
9242279 im new here after all would it be too much to ask who was so interested in a whole store of salicite since its not a big commodity around here
9242280 now you cant be so stupid to think id just tell you
9242281 not like you wouldnt find out once you got here the stock was transferred to the zalista six days ago
9242282 that fool couldnt seal a deal with ulinas if he whored himself
9242283 you didnt know what you were dealing with you pilots get to talking over drinks just like anyone you couldnt know your old buddy was ferreting you its not completely your fault
9242284 livich traded off a full flat of warp coil casings for a bucket of pickles her first week on the job
9242285 none of you were expected to be a goddamned captain
9242286 you must have screwed up big time to run this far
9242287 i just didnt want the reminders there was nothing left but that
9242288 im nothing but bad luck for all of you definitely not reliable and you dont need me screwing up your deals even on an unofficial basis you guys can send the bolian lawyers after me if you want but i wont stay here and kill you all off
9242289 will you remain long enough for us to find the zalista
9242290 the ships stores are all but gone time to give up just try to get something else
9242291 something else will not matter when we lack a pilot
9242292 your error was not unique paris maryl and livich i believe forget that they have made similar ones it is different in your position i understand however we do need your skills
9242293 i believe you are a capable pilot even in a state that starfleet would never allow you on duty
9242294 the academy i lost interest in my studies and so chose not to complete the regimen thus i sought another career
9242295 because i am vulcan does not guarantee that i will be exceptionally careered
9242296 it would likewise bring me satisfaction to find the zalista and correct them for their neglecting what few rules are generally respected among our profession and status moreover for their flouting of federation regulations i have already informed our ulinian contractors that the ship bears no deradiative holds and that they will need to inspect the zalistas cargo for flaws due to chemical breakdown they should suspect what sound ore remains if they are going to use it for more than four years i also suggested they might hold the zalista for orbital inspections as they are exposing themselves and all they come in contact with to hazardous conditions
9242297 will you help us find the zalista certainly its pilot has served you an insult or are you as they say too dead to desire recompense
9242298 even if i wanted to we dont have the power
9242299 i still have some stores that will trade for enough deuterium and plasma to bring us up to full power for a time
9242300 i have been on the circuit long enough to learn frugality
9242301 i dont want to be a captain of anything i go back on board that title goes out the window
9242302 as captain as well as owner of the ship regardless of how this came to be you will be able to design the role as you please while using the title when it is necessary i think we all would like to develop a more egalitarian structure aboard the guerdon if you want to make those changes then you will meet little resistance
9242303 livich uses titles for what blame she desires to pass on
9242304 regardless your positions influence would be whatever you make of it
9242305 then what precisely do you want tom i would like to know
9242306 i believe you know only it is something you believe you cannot obtain
9242307 may i take you back to the ship when you are sufficiently intoxicated
9242308 just make sure livich doesnt try to kill me when we get there okay
9242309 i dont think we should catch up with the zalista first though we should skip kalandra nine station that is the next planned stop right
9242310 why would we go there they do not regularly stock salicite ore would they have any it would be minimal
9242311 but they deal in ore casings and a few other things the zalista needs to take care of their stocks if they dont have deradiative holds like you say theyd have to make up for it by changing out their plating before they have a spill out right i know someone working on irtrin who owes me an out from the brig and happens to work the stocks there meanwhile we need to get ahead of the zalista if we get the power we need do you think we can handle a short speed run
9242312 hard enough to get trek fans to agree water is wet
9242313 all the wulfenbach sparks are known for their oversized gt machinery you know i mean just look at castle wulfenbach gt what exactly are we trying to say here
9242314 you can give up whenever you want but dont do it at our expense
9242315 and i never wanted it either find someone to replace me and trust me ill go
9242316 i just paid your bills out of our pockets you worthless the least you can do is pretend while we complete our deals you can even have a relaxing drink while we underlings work you dont have to do a damn thing and itd probably be better if you didnt
9242317 a pain in the were all glad to see off the circuit hes managed to make an enemy of half the unaffiliated traders and most of the syndicates with his backhanded deals and under the table so called agreements cheap old bastard probably spent only a fifth of his net profit on his crew and that ship which kept them on and kept them going but it wasnt near to democratic if you know what i mean
9242318 that mechanic of yours livich yeah shes not much help she and trusket didnt argue about all things commercial id unload her when you can just a thought
9242319 anyway word has it that trusket bought into a small colony five light years away from bolarus a part shared with the rest of his greedy little clan
9242320 so i guess he took you for a ride too
9242321 and netted himself a cozy retirement package in the bargain a last hoorah after thirty years of pissing people off off to sip drinks on the beach
9242322 hey nothing out of the ordinary here paris just all the more obvious when youre the one whos gotten taken
9242323 so whatre your plans if you cant break out of the contract
9242324 guess were off for podala next then taking the back circle to velir prime following up on a few deals thats not my job though
9242325 why the hell are you guys wasting your time on salicite nobody buys that radioactive crap
9242326 we have the facilities to transport it amazingly enough trusket used to trade heavily in it during the border wars so the guerdons got three ready bays in any case some freelance geologists are building a small science station outside the betreka nebula so i guess they need the resistant hull shell in any case well be picking up the salicite on the way around the kalandra bajor route then back to ulinas
9242327 you can say it paris its boring as a vulcan symposium but it does pay the bills
9242328 maybe youll get a vacation at the end of it all ulinas has a good share of well off scientists and its got some nice resorts
9242329 yeah they do thats something to look forward to thanks
9242330 captain and your own ship thats a change for you though it cant be all bad im surprised youre not feeling it
9242331 this ship needs a hell of a lot more than itll ever afford its not that much of a prize unless you want it
9242332 come on paris youve got a crew thatll do the work all you have to do is steer and speak for them thats not a bad way to get by even if it is a relic
9242333 well thats not really what i was looking for limar
9242334 well theres none of that here none left since two days ago
9242335 even with the ulinian deal well be scraping by for a while hana knows better than to be too proud even if you probably think thats surprising
9242336 bastards cant save a little for the people whore keeping them supplied in the first place
9242337 all the managers are like that until they get to know you they like to see if you squirm
9242338 im new here remember besides im just a pilot the rest shouldnt be my concern
9242339 i know what i said and maybe i still mean it
9242340 that said its going to have to become your concern if youre going to stay here paris
9242341 who said i was sticking around this bucket any longer than i had to
9242342 you were the one who suggested i pretend for the meanwhile and thats just what i plan on doing dont let my charm convince you i care any more than i did the first day i came on board
9242343 else you wont even have ferengi ear muffs to give away
9242344 we got a little but its not going to do the job we need itll break down faster than the last batch did
9242345 you shouldnt have let the supply get so drained in the first place
9242346 ive been trying to keep the rest of that derelict engine in one piece
9242347 sorry but its hard to perform miracles when im stringing together that piece of warp reactor on a daily basis
9242348 and i sure as hell didnt poke a hole in the reaction chamber besides what do you expect me to do about it
9242349 i dont give a damn how you got it but you cant just let the ship stop moving you wont have much to fly at all if that happens
9242350 what do you want from me livich im not getting paid as much as you arent
9242351 i expect you at least give a damn about our surviving out here
9242352 now thats a problem youre talking to the wrong person
9242353 well you shouldve worked harder to keep your captain satisfied
9242354 how about a friendly wager between friends with nothing to lose then
9242355 find me a couple friends in this hellhole and maybe ill consider it
9242356 i got the impression you had more dick than balls
9242357 im after someone whos able to fly youre after a job right
9242358 just what i wanted another opportunity to fly around an biggest commodity around here
9242359 i wouldnt be here soliciting a slob if i didnt need what im asking for
9242360 ill send my tech for you tomorrow morning hell take care of your papers
9242361 payoff time all bets are honored at this table though you can take your own chances later
9242362 kids alive after all up paris time to collect and get us the hell out of here
9242363 besides this is a starfleet boy weve got though he doesnt look like much yet
9242364 yes but theres probably a good reason why hes not in starfleet
9242365 we didnt know much about trusket either when we signed on
9242366 mm hmm and look what happened took the ships repair money his own and this idiot drunks too hes retiring in style somewhere and were stuck with worse than we ever had
9242367 so theres not much we can do now anyway ive got a good feeling about this one
9242368 you can have it okay take it and go just let me sleep
9242369 dont know as much about navigating as your resume says you do kid
9242370 besides you said yourself you needed work well we have that and it comes with a profit for the one who knows how to get around
9242371 sorry but trusket won you the deed on his freighter
9242372 and were needing that deal to go through youll be doing us all and yourself a favor by getting up and getting what is yours considering the dust trusket left behind getting out of here this morning youve got no chance for a rematch
9242373 its real enough kid now come on what do you have to lose
9242374 hana go take care of his contracts and bills well dock it from his share later and ill shove him into the shower just a little alliteration paris but you really do reek of that nasty mizarian ale howd you drink that slime anyway
9242375 ill see about getting you something to detox it and cheer up your lucks not that bad just that you dont know it yet
9242376 the devils advocate that just walked out is my wife believe it or not maryl hana my names eldridge mccauley but everyone calls me ridge weve been with trusket for three years and though hana doesnt show it trust me were all glad hes finally spending our shares elsewhere
9242377 it hurts me to destroy such gt magnficence but my family needs meat this winter
9242378 reserve your right to think for even to think wrongly is better you
9242379 well i guess we both know what ill be like next week

9242474 no podemos aspirar a cambiar el sistema educativo si sus escuelas no est n al d a y a tiempo con las aspiraciones de los padres de familia y con las necesidades de una econom a global
9242475 entre los apoyos que se otorgar n destaca una agenda de prevenci n para adicciones un programa de nutrici n y salud que ponga a los ni os en un punto de arranque parecido al de otras comunidades del pa s adem s de diversos programas de innovaci n como escuela de tiempo completo y escuela de horario discontinuo todo esto para integrar y convertir a la escuela en un centro de desarrollo e integraci n comunitaria
9242476 esta transformaci n concentra por lo menos tres aspectos esenciales en la vida de los ni os aprender a ser aprender a aprender y aprender a convivir
9242477 las evaluaciones nos perfilan a un tipo de educaci n basada en habilidades y competencias para el trabajo en transformaciones que pongan en el centro del sistema a los alumnos los maestros a las escuelas y a los padres de familia

9242489 que los est ndares curriculares son dise ados para la mejora de la practica escolar pero tambi n para que sirvan como punto de referencia en las evaluaciones y con base en esto observar realmente qu tipo de est ndares se deben seguir aplicando para cambiar el trabajo de los alumnos de operar y crear a mecanismos para que exploren comuniquen y creen
9242490 en nuestro pa s los est ndares acad micos de educaci n b sica deben abarcar los contenidos habilidades y destrezas b sicos para garantizar una educaci n de calidad a todos los estudiantes independientemente del tipo de escuela en la que estudien
9242491 se deben tomar acciones para que los padres y madres de familia reconozcan y entiendan los est ndares y que estos puedan individualizar la educaci n para aprovechar el mejoramiento de todos los ni os en la educaci n b sica as mismo se al la importancia de la participaci n de los maestros en el establecimiento de est ndares para beneficio de la comunidad y la calidad educativa

9242497 yo me pregunt podr n haber hormonas de estr s de otras plantas que tengan alguna eficacia cl nica mientras varios estudios han sugerido que la aspirina puede prevenir el c ncer especialmente el c ncer de colon me di cuenta que podr a haber una chance de encontrar una hormona vegetal potente que pueda luchar contra el c ncer incluso mejor i le apunt al jasmonate
9242498 el compuesto jasmonate es utilizado mucho en agricultura y en cosm tico
9242499 ya se ha probado que no es t xico tiene el mismo estatus regulatorio que la sal de mesa eso el el hecho de que estamos trabajando con un qu mico natural nos da un buen punto de partida para lanzar una nueva droga

9242525 it kind of validates what weve been saying that these storefronts that are for profit that really have no relationship with medical marijuana users are really not within the law
9242526 i think its part of an overall strategy to run for governor in 2010

9242593 now this is eternal life that they may know you the only true god and jesus christ whom you have sent
9242594 delight yourself in the lord and he will give you the desires of your heart
9242595 and now dear children continue to live in fellowship with christ so that when he returns you will be full of courage and not shrink back from him in shame see how much our heavenly father loves us for he allows us to be called his children and we really are but the people who belong to this world dont know god so they do not understand that we are his children yes dear friends we are already gods children and we cant even imagine what we will be like when christ returns
9242596 i have come to meet with you today walk with me today
9242597 i am praying not only for these disciples but also for all who will ever believe in me because of their testimony my prayer for all of them is that they will be one just as you and i are one father that just as you are in me and i am in you so they will be in us and the world will believe you sent me i have given them the glory you gave me so that they may be one as we are i in them and you in me all being perfected into one
9242598 but you are my witnesses o israel says the lord and you are my servant you have been chosen to know me believe in me and understand that i alone am god there is no other god there has never been and never will be i am the lord and there is no other savior first i predicted your deliverance i declared what i would do and then i did it i saved you no foreign god had ever done this before you are my witnesses that i am the only god from eternity to eternity i am god no one can oppose what i do no one can reverse my actions
9242599 god has given to each of you from his great variety of spiritual gifts manage them well so that gods generosity can flow through you
9242600 then god will be given the glory in everything through jesus christ
9242601 have i put my trust in money or felt secure because of my gold does my happiness depend on my wealth and all that i own have i looked at the sun shining in the skies or the moon walking down the the silvery pathway and been secretly enticed in my heart to worship them if so i should be punished by the judges for it would mean that i would have denied the god in heaven

9242615 what is it exactly that the v p does every day
9242616 the democrats also preach individual freedoms and individual rights capitalism free market let it do its thing best let people keep as much of their money that they earn as possible and when it comes to like the party machine no one will accuse me of being partisan

9242766 im a long time poster of the allakhazam forums i found the site a few years ago when i was searching for ffxi information and i it has carried me through ffxi wow lotro and hopefully war i plan to roll a greenskin shaman but i have to say runepriest might actually be my favorite career
9242767 the pvp focus was what initially caught my attention there were a lot of mmos coming out and i knew a lot of them would flop war was the only game where the updates continually impressed me i never felt like any of the revealed information about the game was taking it in the wrong direction once i finally had the chance to play it during preview weekend i knew i was hooked
9242768 this is a world at war its important to understand that everywhere around you there is conflict battles rage both large and small if you are squeamish about battle or torture and hope the two factions can get along and hold hands it will be apparent right from the start that this is not the game for you
9242769 yes the quests introduce you to what is going on and give some information about the race you have chosen each faction has career choices mirrored in the opposing faction so there are enough similarities that choices can be based on roleplay lore or aesthetic reasons
9242770 they definitely have a very distinctive atmosphere the chaos zones definitely have a dreary and malevolent appearance and thehigh elves have their bright and shiny structures but when you look into the lore of warhammer you see that really no realm is truly the good side the empire is fending off the evil chaos hordes they want to wipe them out witch hunters are inquisitors who would turn in a friend if they showed the slightest sign of heresy the aesthetic of good vs evil is there but the story changes as you go deeper into the lore
9242771 the graphics in wow tend to have a cartoon like feel
9242772 the comparison of war with wow is very valid warcraft stole their lore from warhammer and war stole many gameplay ideas and styles from wow i guess blizzard and mythic can call it a draw now
9242773 i havent had a chance to explore the guild features yet
9242774 i liked this game enough that i put forth the effort to create my own guild warhammer offers several tools to do what players have previously been doing outside of the guild war lets you form formal alliances with other guilds mark dates on your own guild calendar the ability to tax members boo and a guild vault two features stand out the most guild banners and claiming objectives banners offer another element of strategy and customization to guilds banner may be carried or at later levels planted in the ground to provide an aoe group buff to your guild members based on the tactics you have slotted banners also let guilds claim keeps they have taken over when your guild takes an objective that benefits your realm everyone will know that it was your guild that did it
9242775 as i mentioned earlier the game provides lots of catalysts for grouping open groups and public quest are both tools that strengthen access to group activities one option i would like to see added at a later time is the option to put a tag by your open group stating its purpose this would make it easier to join a group focusing on the type of activity you want to do
9242776 most exciting logging in and being able to select a server serious close second seeing a dark elf army pouring out of a black ark with a hydra leading the way most disappointing that i was exiting out of the game when the hydra was coming out and didnt get a screenshot serious close second no black guard i cant wait to see them in game
9242777 the greatest disappointment for me was in the lack of responsiveness of the abilities which they are currently fixing

9242836 what does clayton have to do to make the team the kid can run the football idiotic cut
9242837 freakin letting jto practice with the ist team offense and throws alex to start against the charger wow
9242838 i here that why didny they let jto go against the chargers if he is penciled tobe the starter why
9242839 michael silver wrote that smith isnt the only one who thinks the competition was a sham shawn hill
9242840 i did some good things and some bad things ive got to go look at the films to see how i did the one errant throw floated on me and i had the interception in the red zone which was hard on me the fourth down in the red zone id like to have that one back too other than that ive got to look at the film and take it for what it is learn from the mistakes and get better
9242841 we feel disgusted at the turnovers i dont remember anything except for those two plays those things are 100 percent unacceptable i am disgusted about those turnovers you cant make excuses for something like that
9242842 what does clayton have to do to make the team the kid can run the football idiotic cut
9242843 freakin letting jto practice with the ist team offense and throws alex to start against the charger wow
9242844 i here that why didny they let jto go against the chargers if he is penciled tobe the starter why
9242845 michael silver wrote that smith isnt the only one who thinks the competition was a sham shawn hill
9242846 when it gets right down to it it became a durability issue coach mike nolan said a few hours after cutting the veteran receiver
9242847 if you cant count on somebody for whatever reason it becomes a tough call nolan said
9242848 but when you take the whole package of michael robinson hes valuable to your football team
9242849 we just didnt see him really push for the job like wed hoped
9242850 ulbrich is still ahead of him at this point nolan said
9242851 what does clayton have to do to make the team the kid can run the football idiotic cut
9242852 freakin letting jto practice with the ist team offense and throws alex to start against the charger wow
9242853 i here that why didny they let jto go against the chargers if he is penciled tobe the starter why
9242854 michael silver wrote that smith isnt the only one who thinks the competition was a sham shawn hill
9242855 if you cant count on somebody for whatever the reason its a tough call
9242856 in the past we usually have 9 or 10 with a practice squad guy it might be one heavy from what we usually do but we have a decent group of defensive backs and several young guys who we need to keep around because we have a couple of guys who might be graduating one day more importantly than any of that i think we have a lot of defensive backs and i dont want to put them out on the street for someone elses benefit
9242857 it really became a durability issue he did not practice much here and since hes been here theres been some durability issues if you cant count on somebody for whatever the reason its a tough call but we made the decision we did
9242858 hes good in the backfield hes good out of the backfield i think hes a jack of all trades at this point hes probably not a master of any one thing but a jack of all trades he plays at a high level hes got very good hands hes a pretty good route runner he did miss some time so hes got to get back up to speed but i have a lot of confidence in michael hes an outstanding special teams player hes one of our leaders and players look up to him because they respect him you take the total package of michael robinson and hes pretty valuable to your team
9242859 we were looking for someone to play alongside to patrick willis early on we were hopeful that maybe he had a chance to be that guy as it went along hes still inexperienced to the point that we didnt see him pushing for the job as we may have hoped i think he made some good plays last night

9242910 it is like a king who before he enters the city the people of the city go out to greet him in the field there everyone who so desires is permitted to meet him he receives them all with a cheerful countenance and shows a smiling face to them all and when he goes to the city they follow him there later however after he enters his royal palace none can enter into his presence except by appointment and only special people and select individuals so too by analogy the month of elul is when we meet g d in the field
9242911 if there were any word of god beside the scripture we could never be certain of gods word and if we be uncertain of gods word the devil might bring in among us a new word a new doctrine a new faith a new church a new god yea himself to be a god if the church and the christian faith did not stay itself upon the word of god certain as upon a sure and strong foundation no man could know whether he had a right faith and whether he were in the true church of christ or a synagogue of satan
9242912 gods grace is promised to one who feareth god and not to sees or successions
9242913 we are to know that the word of god is his heavenly truth touching matters of eternal life and uttered unto men unto prophets and apostles by immediate divine inspiration from them to us by their books and writings we have therefore no word of god but the scripture

9242937 in dem er auf das recht der territorialen integrit t von serbien hinwies denn im november 2007 hat der uno sicherheitsrat die resolution 1244 angenommen in der die territoriale integrit t aller staaten des ehemaligen jugoslawien best tigt wurde
9242938 warum habt ihr euch dann einige monate sp ter nicht gegen die einseitige unabh ngigkeitserkl rung des kosovo gestellt

9242963 it is uncertain whether congress will take the administration up on its request
9242964 some republicans have already embraced the idea with representative lamar smith of texas the ranking republican on the judiciary committee introducing a measure almost identical to the administrations proposal
9242965 recalls a resolution known as the authorization for use of military force passed by congress on sept 14 2001 which authorized the president to use all necessary and appropriate force against those responsible for the sept 11 attacks to prevent future strikes that authorization still in effect was initially viewed by many members of congress who voted for it as the go ahead for the administration to invade afghanistan and overthrow the taliban which had given sanctuary to mr bin laden
9242966 but the military authorization became the secret legal basis for some of the administrations most controversial legal tactics including the wiretapping program and that still gnaws at some members of congress

9242982 allows inmates to be trained in work habits and allows them to develop marketable skills in the areas of farming animal husbandry vegetable meat and milk processing
9242983 the warden says it takes good food good medicine good prayin and good playin to have a good prison
9242984 in the conventional plantations slaves were given just enough food clothing and shelter to be a financial asset to the owner the same is true for the louisiana prison system
9242985 prisoners worked out in the field sometimes 17 hours straight rain or shine
9242986 theyd tell you the officer was always right no matter what
9242987 neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime where of the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the united states
9242988 prisoners can be forced to work for the government against their will and this is true in every state
9242989 i would have more faith in that amendment if it werent so clear that our criminal justice system is racially biased in a really obvious way
9242990 i dont have any illusions that this is a simple process
9242991 many people are apathetic about what happens in prisons it would be very difficult but i would not suggest it would be impossible
9242992 many black inmates viewed farm work under these circumstances as too close to slavery to want to participate

9243082 we will very likely see more cases linked to the outbreak given the timeframes involved for symptoms to show up and testing to occur
9243083 what makes this situation different from what happened three years ago is that the state has pre positioned commodities and resources like food and water ready to roll once this thing hits
9243084 its been quiet for a few years and were hoping people havent become apathetic

9243090 i went in to see if i could help there was nothing that could be done for anyone in the front of the store
9243091 locals in the county rushed out into the open cracks appeared on house walls and many windows were broken
9243092 there is a possibility when it does move out into the gulf of mexico it could be as strong as as a category four or five now thats very similar to what we saw with rita and katrina and certainly will raise grave concerns along coastal communities
9243093 we had people on the ground working with the communities to try to get people into the emergency shelters ahead of time
9243094 we launched an aggressive public information campaign so people took the storm seriously
9243095 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
9243096 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by five 10 15 cents a gallon

9243105 the two men began laughing at how silly erics bandages looked
9243106 this is prompted by the fact that one in four children in british columbia is either overweight or obese

9243110 it doesnt mean that a student couldnt have pizza its just a matter of whats on that pizza
9243111 absolutely teachers are behind that but that revenue was funding sports teams special events and in some cases text books and basic supplies
9243112 you cant add p e in schools without adding space for that and resources for that
9243113 we dont have the gym space in vancouver it rains a lot and you cant have kids out there on the field in the pouring rain and in many parts of the province its very cold in the winter
9243114 fundamentally you need to have classrooms that are going to be as effective as possible
9243115 we continue to struggle to convince the government to address resources there
9243116 the prime ministers legal actions are an attempt to use the courts to interfere with the official oppositions freedom of political expression and thereby give his party an advantage over his principal political opponents
9243117 such an injection of legal action into our political debates were it to succeed would give the government party a political advantage over its opponents
9243118 someone with strong principals a fighting spirit and deep compassion
9243119 she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her when to sit down
9243120 shes exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second my friends and fellow americans i am very pleased and very priviledged to introduce to you the next vice president of the united states gov sarah palin of the great state of alaska
9243121 to have been chosen brings a great challenge i know it will demand the best that i have to give and i promise nothing less
9243122 its always safest in politics to avoid risk to sort of go along status quo but i didnt get into politics to do the safe things a ship in harbour is safe but thats not what it was built for
9243123 another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9243124 the enrich the rich the rich at the expense of everyone else
9243125 if you dont agree with us you are an intolerant extremist
9243126 barrack makes me think of trying just a little more at being caring of others he motivates
9243127 its high time to put all the left wingers out of their misery
9243128 everything i ever needed to know i learned in kindergarten
9243129 most soldiers i recall take orders mccain should try to remember that
9243130 we dont vaccinate dogs if they were so damn smart theyd come up with their own vaccine i say

9243140 all night last night there was wind but not like now now its very strong things are starting to fall down

9243142 im going to be leery the first few nights like every little crack i hear is going to make me wonder
9243143 theyre facing a lot of cleanup in many cases and a lot of work
9243144 this is a situation that has infuriated a great deal of people its hurt a great deal of people
9243145 theres no water laundy facilities arent available and you look at the front theres no place to park its still a mess out here you know
9243146 theres no compensation other than the fact that we got people back in as quickly as possible
9243147 i think everybody thinks the same thing it wont happen to me
9243148 all the food borne illnesses that are floating around this country of ours theres anger toward that that canadians have to be subjected to this type of lackadaisical attitude toward food safety
9243149 i want her death to be counted and for people to know this is a real hazard out there
9243150 whether listeria was the actual cause or the underlying cause is very difficult to determine
9243151 many of our recalls relate to products such as sandwiches and pre packaged meats meats carrying best before dates that have now already expired
9243152 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me
9243153 i would rather hear you say that at the end of the trial rather than the beginning
9243154 and now that im talking to you i feel blood freezing in my veins
9243155 in my mind i saw my son my husband and 22 members of my family that were killed in srebrenica
9243156 may i hold you to your word that i am not guilty
9243157 with a green mp sitting in the house of commons it will now be impossible to exclude the green party from the televised leaders debates in the next election
9243158 the sun and the moon and stars all lined up

9243160 not only do i embrace the policies of my new party i will feel that all my past difficulties are justified if by my actions i can make a real difference by ensuring elizabeth may is included in the leaders debates
9243161 there is a democracy deficit in canadian politics and this is one step in restoring effective democracy in canada
9243162 this is a promising new lead in the search for biological pathways that contribute to obesity
9243163 this finding may eventually lead to the development of new drugs to regulate appetite in people who have not had success with other treatments
9243164 what we do not know is the reason for the imbalance in deaths
9243165 what we learned from hurricane katrina is that disaster preparedness efforts must focus on evacuating and caring for vulnerable populations particularly the elderly including those in hospitals nursing homes and private residences

9243184 the presidential run off between senator barak obama and senator john mccain we also have bob barr and chuck baldwin running not too mention a few i left out alan keys etc
9243185 when russia has a grievance over an issue such as south ossetia it should act multilaterally by consent rather than unilaterally by force
9243186 my message to russia is simple if you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the g8 oecd and wto you must accept that with rights come responsibilities
9243187 we want russia to be a good partner in the g8 and other organisations but it cannot pick and choose which rules to adhere to
9243188 that is why i will argue tomorrow that russia should accept georgias territorial integrity and international mechanisms for addressing these conflicts and withdraw troops to their previous positions
9243189 and in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9243190 we are also reflecting on the nato response we must re evaluate the alliances relationship with russia and intensify our support to georgia and others who may face russian aggression
9243191 must add urgency to the work on europes energy agenda
9243192 we must more rapidly build relationships with other producers of oil and gas

9243420 theyll be talking about jewel in the parking lots tonight who is that where did he come from
9243421 hes got some quickness to the corner and hes not afraid to run up the middle id say hes got a bright future with the hawkeyes
9243422 as a unit it looks like we have a little more depth and we improved they had a nice day
9243423 mr hampton will no doubt remember that first carry and his first day in kinnick
9243424 i had to take steroids for a while when i had this disease called sarcoidosis and i was going absolutely insane there was this guy doing sound for us and he was an antagonist to say the least i was eating in a diner and i was so out of my mind on steroids i tried to stab him i leaped on the table and flung my milk at him a knife in my other hand the waiter was like oh my god they threw us out thats funny isnt it
9243425 i have to support them theres always the possibility for me that in the near future ill have to get a real job rock and roll is a young mans game these days after a concert i usually just drink and sweat
9243426 i went to school to become a nurse thats totally far from the image of a punk hilarious i actually think about going back to school im kind of a nerd so maybe something like engineering or just technical work
9243427 it was all just an adventure we used to break down in the middle of a desert and just be sitting out there saying well i guess well figure it out wed be due on stage and we wouldnt even be there i think things got less fun when we started making money
9243428 its an interesting feeling when i go on tour now like wow all that freedom you dont have that with a kid its a holiday for me but unfortunately its mixed with the fact that i end up missing my daughter its really painful to be separated from her
9243429 the only useful decision to come out of the su in the last seven years
9243430 i dont think we got out worked tonight we just got out played
9243431 iraq signs multi billion dollar oil deal with china wtf

9243433 descartes believes the soul of the australian wallabees mating rituals denies the post communist russian economy its conditioning of pavlovs dog
9243434 weve only got a small number of fourth and fifth year players so the team is undoubtedly going to be led by john konye danny nielsen alex campos returning after he didnt play last year and cam black a student from red deer whos with us for his second year but hes been around the college program
9243435 those are the senior players thats where the leadership is going to come from but we have an emerging group of second and third year players who are definitely canada west seasoned
9243436 it definitely motivates me weve kept around some players who possess a lot of speed and at the higher level game it becomes of paramount importance
9243437 athletically i think were a little bit stronger than last year youve got to be strong in the goalkeeping position and central defence has to be capable of dealing with an aerial attack which tends to come from a good number of the canada west opponents most things have been coming together and thats why it looks promising
9243438 in our first four games all of them are played on the road and were playing the current national champions in our second game then there are two away games with calgary and lethbridge the following weekend so were going to face some adversity and were definitely going to be challenged but if we just keep approaching the challenges as weve done up until now theres a lot to look forward to
9243439 victoria is probably the most experienced team now theyve taken over from ubc and perhaps trinity western in terms of number of players going into their fourth and fifth years
9243440 theyll play a very strong powerful direct game and thats why we need to be strong to withstand an aerial attack or bombardment if you like because theyre going to get the ball forward quickly
9243441 ubc lost a number of their fifth year players who returned last year to play in the national championship that they were hosting
9243442 but vancouver is a hotbed of soccer and theyve got a lot of players coming in with significant provincial and national team experience its definitely going to be a challenge but we might as well face it from the get go to see what were made of itll tell us a lot about our group of players and what we need to do regardless of the results from that first weekend to put us in the top four and then be a contender in the playoffs
9243443 i thought we played very physical and it was wonderful to see us stick to the game plan and make adjustments our errors are very fixable and we need to keep improving
9243444 they were in the ncaa tournament last season and thats where we want to be at the end of the year we really came out aggressive and played hard the team is really looking forward to getting back on the court tonight against alabama
9243445 dont be afraid to suck and learn from the mistakes you make
9243446 i havent kept many photographs of myself but i found one where im in full flight im leaning into a turn you pick up the centrifugal forces and you lay in it for a few seconds like a gyroscope they support you im in full flight and my head is turned im concentrating on something and im grinning thats the way i like to picture myself im something else there im on another level of existence just being in pure motion going wherever i want to go whenever i want to go thats nice you know
9243447 because well be on top of things during the cis season were going to be well ahead of the game because well be able to identify athletes get them trained and look to have them prepared
9243448 i feel very honoured to have the privilege to work with the canadian team at the world fisu games
9243449 i have never played nor coached internationally national so far is the highest for me
9243450 what it will do is answer the question of where the differences are in national and international competition
9243451 having been exposed to national play i have seen canadian players who have played internationally and got to see what theyve done
9243452 we know that the canadian womens national team was able to get to the olympics and see some results as well as with the womens world cup so i think itll be interesting to take the university level and see where its at by comparison
9243453 in previous years when weve selected athletes its been done in april so they have may and june to sort of get themselves physically prepared
9243454 but now because well be on top of things during the cis season were going to be well ahead of the game because well be able to identify athletes get them trained and look to have them prepared
9243455 its tough to say really we have to do more legwork to see what kind of team will be selected
9243456 i know that there are some national team players or at least ex national team players that are playing in the quebec division so there could be some potential athletes there of course ontario will have to be brought up to speed by some of the coaches that are in that division from the bc schools we have some very strong keepers that have come out as all stars and canada west has shown to be a pretty strong division
9243457 were just in the process of separating all the tasks
9243458 with the fisu games unfortunately its not a canadian funded project so were responsible for everything to be able to get to universiade fundraising getting uniforms organizing the training camp sending the players creating opportunities for the players etc
9243459 you talk about loyal fans i want to say thank you to them for turning out like they did
9243460 shonns not quite full speed yet but hes getting closer
9243461 im extremely appreciative of our fans you talk about loyal fans i want to say thank you to them for turning out like they did
9243462 everything was mostly good well see what the tape looks like and see what the next week of practice looks like
9243463 we gave up a little more than i like to see
9243464 if were going to be a good football team were going to have to stop the run
9243465 china road the journey into the future of the risisng power
9243466 vba wont work in 2010 spend this time porting your stuff over to our new scripting language
9243467 one of the objectives of training camp is to make sure that they start learning the structure understanding the offence and what it takes to start competing at a higher level
9243468 every game is equally as important but the biggest factor is getting out of the gates and creating some momentum
9243469 coach stead is bringing in what he knows best and with that comes offensive changes
9243470 everybody is learning from a brand new starting point whether a player is here in their first or fifth year everyone is very focused and paying attention and thats bringing us up the ladder really quickly
9243471 its been a pretty frustrating first few days but you can start to see the potential come day four and five the offensive concepts are great and we have the talent here so its really progressing
9243472 we have a great d line with a lot of depth we have a lot of vets returning and a lot of new guys who could start for us teams are going to have a hard time running against us with our secondary looking as fast as they do and our front seven being so strong
9243473 some of the veteran players that have canada west experience guys like simeon rottier gord hinse aaron holba damon fraietta quade armstrong at quarterback danny bass and chris muchena are all in a foundation in each one of their units and are respectively going to bring stability to their area
9243474 perfecting our execution is going to take time so thats going to be one of the things were going to have to get a handle on both offensively and defensively
9243475 its going to be a matter of how quickly were going to get up that ladder and if we dont get up weve got to have enough arrows in the quiver to give us an opportunity to win
9243476 i anticipate theyre going to be a much better football team than last year based on all their returners and them having more experience so its going to be a tough opener
9243477 the people were so genuine and this is truly an institution that cares about its athletes the student athlete experience is very very important to me ive coached for 25 years and i want our players to have a great experience and certainly winning helps that experience but this is an easy place to move to because of the people
9243478 in the four films starring kate we are given dream sequences that invite us to imagine how we might fulfil her desires
9243479 the dreams are beautifully crafted fantasies each with an eerie atmosphere that brings us into a serene la la land where we feel free to imagine pleasing kate
9243480 im hoping that itll firm it up and shape it up
9243481 everyone is asking if im worried its going to go away no its going to tone it up i can use that

9243495 the most important thing this approval body looks at is heritage but they had other reasons that were equally important
9243496 they didnt want to name a public facility after a private building or company in the past names for companies have changed and its just too inconvenient and expensive to fix the stations name again and again how do we know enterprise square will remain enterprise square
9243497 also enterprise square is just one building and it isnt even that well integrated with the lrt station there are other buildings there too and so it seems unfair
9243498 while i wouldnt say that we feel we are guiding edmonton in the sense that the hudsons bay company guided this city i do feel that we are key contributors to this citys success and direction
9243499 recently a poll showed 82 per cent of edmontonians thought the u of a was important for civic pride we have contributed greatly to the economic well being of edmonton we are very engaged with the larger community and government agencies
9243500 the bay was a pioneering business based on exploration and enterprise when you look at whats happening in enterprise square with the location of the school of business and faculty of extension its very much about exploration discovery and enterprise
9243501 its important for the university to have a strong presence in the city and to create a supportive community for our students
9243502 changing the name would be a positive endeavor it gives the university a chance to showcase its different campuses across the city
9243503 they didnt want to name a public facility after a private building or company
9243504 i think the university is confused about what we do we are an important and historical part of university life students are going to expect the houses to be close to university more accessible
9243505 if you woke up one morning to find a cigarette butt in your front yard how would you know who threw it
9243506 building and purchasing houses in south campus would be the fraternities responsibility
9243507 i think the university is confused about what we do
9243508 we are an important and historical part of university life students are going to expect the houses to be close to university more accessible if you take our house and remove it far from the main campus students would have less options for cheap housing the rent would be cheaper than university residences but because its so far away its no longer worth it
9243509 they said they couldnt write us up because theres absolutely no reason to do so before every single party we have a protocol we follow we go to our neighbors and tell them well be having a party and after this time well take it inside were really respectful about it
9243510 this meeting was organized so that we could consider other options as well
9243511 we will probably also look at whats happening in other communities in the us and canada which have fraternity houses in their midst certainly this is not a new issue and other communities have struggled with these kinds of problems
9243512 they are a governing body for all the fraternities and sororities yes but they are not going to be able to speak on our behalf
9243513 what it comes down to is stigmatization which leads to alienation
9243514 i remember when these people used to direct their nasty attacks at us 20 years ago and their prejudice against fraternities has had two decades to mature
9243515 since i started my research and started trying to read around different forms of popular print ive become convinced there is a popular aesthetic to it
9243516 my research assumption is that there really is no well founded hierarchical difference between kinds of reading matter people read what they read because they find it interesting and they find it interesting because it speaks to the real material interests in their everyday lives
9243517 most people have condemned popular print culture having never read it for one thing since i started my research and started trying to read around different forms of popular print ive become convinced there is a popular aesthetic to it
9243518 there are artistic and literary codes that readers and writers understand very well often these are disparaged among academics as formulaic but a tragedy is a formula a high romantic comedy is a formula a henry james novel is a formula
9243519 in the domain of popular arts it is often the commercial producers who are the real researchers
9243520 paula eykelhof knows much more than any academic ive heard of about harlequin romance trends shes a researcher she doesnt call herself a researcher but she has research knowledge the same could be said of comic book collectors they are researchers they have knowledge it is valuable knowledge
9243521 this conference is designed to bring together writers publishers books sellers collectors and teachers like myself
9243522 siha was founded by a group of medical students who originally just started discussing international health as a focus group
9243523 in recent years its been that we not only go into the communities and talk about preventative healthcare steps that people within the community can do but we also provide supplies that they can use like bed nets for malaria condoms for hiv and handkerchiefs for tuberculosis
9243524 in our village miono we had a definite focus on travelling to the outlying areas and we were able to reach eight of them to deliver our seminars we also had a big bed net giveaway and we gave them to kindergarteners and grade ones and twos which was really nice
9243525 the group was started off by medical students but somewhere along the line we just became a very interdisciplinary organization theres no preference for what faculty youre in and we really love having students from all different faculties
9243526 its a different perspective which makes us really well rounded
9243527 our organization is a big commitment because we want our members to be really well trained and really know the material since they become the teachers
9243528 you know a hookah for breathing under water compressor tubes regulator
9243529 oh yeah i was picturing you and all the kids on deck smoking a hookah you know to each his own
9243530 it adds bones that allow the character to move freely without major distortions in the character skin which minimizes having to paint skin weights
9243531 it looks specifically at the diffusion of water in the brain and by getting information on the magnitude and direction of the water diffusion we can map out the brains connections and their integrity
9243532 we looked at children who have been diagnosed at the glenrose hospital and when we compared their brains to those of normal healthy children we found gross abnormalities across a number of white matter tracts
9243533 we looked at ten major tracts and found that seven of the ten were damaged in children with fasd
9243534 the most compelling part of this study is that alcohol really affects the whole developing brain and the majority of the tracts
9243535 currently were recruiting and scanning some older subjects our original subjects were 5 13 years old and now were looking at some teenagers even some young adults so we can look at the trajectory of brain development
9243536 did you ever notice the first thing a non sailor will ask an experienced sailor is have you ever been in a bad storm
9243537 this is great but i wish it was someone elses boat
9243538 when the wind kicks up get the hell off the lake
9243539 no me lo cre a pensaba que era una broma pero no iba muy en serio
9243540 estaba convencido de que jugar a cinco o diez minutos y debutar a pero entre problemas de lesiones de est mago y otras bajas tuvimos que formar pareja v ctor ikpeba y yo
9243541 esa es la nica derrota en toda mi carrera que no me dej triste
9243542 empec a correr a querer hacerlo todo a ir de un lado a otro estaba muerto y mir al marcador s lo hab an pasado diez minutos y ya estaba muerto entre los nervios y querer llegar a todo
9243543 no jugu bien la verdad es que no se puede decir que jugara bien aquel d a
9243544 cuando echo la vista atr s sobretodo veo mucho trabajo la gente s lo te ve el domingo durante 90 minutos en el terreno de juego pero no ve todas las horas de trabajo a las que te enfrentas durante la semana
9243545 est claro que durante todo este tiempo que me ha pasado muy r pido hay buenos y malos momentos pero creo que estar arriba del todo durante 14 a os es duro cada a o hay que darlo todo y darlo todo siempre no es f cil
9243546 satisfacer a mi padre lo he dicho un mont n de veces quer a que l fuera feliz vi ndome jugar al principio no jugaba por m sino por mi padre
9243547 he jugado en estadios llenos partidos en los que hab a much simo en juego a nivel internacional y a nivel de club pero al hacerlo enfrente de tu padre sientes una presi n especial
9243548 que la gente se acuerde de m cada uno con su opini n pero el que se acuerden de ti ya es algo muy positivo
9243549 pusimos a soria en el mapa con la eliminatoria de copa de 1996
9243550 pusimos a soria en el mapa con la eliminatoria de copa de 1996
9243551 it was definitely really hot but i think we all worked together as a team and fed off our energy
9243552 i think thats what weve been missing in the past couple years is somebody who can just create goals out of nothing sometimes its big
9243553 having that available to us is exciting because now teams are going to have to prepare in a lot of different ways and find a way to try to stop us
9243554 the second one i got a really nice ball from brittney smit she sent it through and i just had a clear shot
9243555 hopefully i can keep it going its been pretty awesome so far so hopefully it keeps up
9243556 we came out a little slow i think the goal kind of woke us up and it was good to see that we reacted to it
9243557 some of the goals we got were a little scrappy today but thats good to see and the fact that were not giving up at any point in the game is a good thing
9243558 amy does a lot of tireless work just up and down the field which sometimes goes unnoticed but she does a lot to create a lot of goals for us
9243559 it makes things a lot easier for a lot of other players so the fact that she could get a pair of goals for us today is great
9243560 s que aqu lleva muchos a os sin ganar pero eso no nos asegura absolutamente nada el real madrid es dif cil en cualquier momento de la temporada si est mal porque est mal si est bien porque est bien
9243561 soy de la opini n que la liga la tienen que ganar real madrid o barcelona si fallan los dos aparecer cualquiera de los otros que tenemos en mente como en su d a fue el valencia o el deportivo
9243562 resulta dif cil entender la racha cuando me hablaban de ella pensaba que ser a seis o siete a os porque es dif cil entender que sean tantos porque el madrid acaba ganando un a o u otro pero vamos a tocar madera para que siga la racha
9243563 pusimos a soria en el mapa con la eliminatoria de copa de 1996
9243564 es el que ha tocado y hay que ganar y convencer porque en la liga hay que ir paso a paso y no nos queda otra opci n que estar listos para este partido y hacernos con los tres puntos
9243565 las sensaciones de la pretemporada han sido buenas y estoy seguro de que lo haremos bien pero los inicios siempre son complicados es un partido especial obviamente no hay que dramatizar porque la liga no se ganar en soria en caso de triunfo ni tampoco se perder si perdemos
9243566 lo que tenemos que hacer es trabajar y jugar como sabemos ante el wisla pasara lo que pasara no bamos a ganar la champions pero s que pod amos perderla y en el c mputo de la eliminatoria hicimos un buen papel luchamos hasta el final tratamos de empatar a pesar de que en la primera parte con un ojo mir bamos la porter a rival y con el otro tratamos de defender nuestro marco estoy satisfecho porque de ninguna manera fuimos a polonia a pasearnos no obstante centramos toda la pretemporada en el partido de champions y quiz s descuidamos la liga pero que nadie dude que nuestra intenci n es la de ganar para meternos cuanto antes en una din mica positiva buscando una inercia
9243567 somos favoritos a ganar la liga siempre es complicado hacer pron sticos pero est claro que nosotros somos uno de los favoritos al campeonato no creo que el madrid sea el gran favorito pero s candidato el camino determinar lo que debe pasar si nos ganan ser porque no hacemos bien nuestro trabajo
9243568 le veo bien cuando estuvo entrenando con el equipo lo hizo con tanta ilusi n que quiz forz un poco la m quina por lo que tenemos que ser muy prudentes con estas lesiones adem s ha tenido una peque a contractura que le ha hecho perder tono muscular y trabajamos para recuperarlo
9243569 le veo muy animado y en tres semanas ya estar entrenando a tope con el grupo seguro
9243570 podemos decir que ser un fichaje de invierno para el primer equipo gaby es un profesional como la copa de un pino y le gustar a estar en barcelona pero sabemos que en argentina tiene a los suyos y puede seguir con el proceso de recuperaci n sin problemas
9243571 quiso venir para que le viera y todo va sobre ruedas hace tres meses y medio que le oper y est tonificando isquiotibiales cuadriceps y haciendo bicicleta bajo la supervisi n de homero de agostino y ra l madero los m dicos de la selecci n argentina
9243572 pusimos a soria en el mapa con la eliminatoria de copa de 1996
9243573 s s ganamos a la real pero tenemos un vestuario en el que no hay azulejos ni calefacci n los techos son muy altos
9243574 oye ra l que los trapos sucios se lavan en casa
9243575 llegaba mr marshall a soria y lo que son las cosas con la visita de los catalanes se acondicionaron los vestuarios ven a el bar a
9243576 hac a un fr o del carajo incluso nev pero la gente ah estaba en el campo y dos hora antes del partido
9243577 tom im genes del desplazamiento en autocar de los vestuarios
9243578 y lo de personalizar las camisetas fue idea m a yo las rotul todas y no se acuerdan que me compararon con bakero por ser f sicamente muy parecidos
9243579 nuestra intenci n era abrazarnos en el camp nou cada vez que lanz ramos un saque de esquina
9243580 esa eliminatoria lo cambi todo y el presidente que sigue al pie del ca n fue el m s listo aprovech la ocasi n para poner unas bases muy s lidas que han dado sus frutos un nuevo campo una fundaci n secciones estar tres temporadas en primera fue un milagro
9243581 las cosas me han ido bien no me puedo quejar
9243582 aunque t desees ser como todo el mundo en realidad no lo eres tienes limitaciones y hay que aprender a asimilarlas y convivir con ellas del mejor modo posible pero sin renunciar a nada
9243583 definitivamente es m s duro de lo que esperaba no muchas horas de pie y haciendo aceleraciones cada dos por tres no es lo mejor para mi pr tesis es agotador
9243584 estando en la pista con gente tan competitiva puedo percibir su empuje y su condici n atl tica y casi te sientes parte de ello
9243585 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated

9243593 although movement has slowed slightly the fact it is still moving is significant hills arent supposed to move at all
9243594 we would expect the movement to slow when the weather is fine and the ground dries out however any heavy rain would cause substantial movement
9243595 what we do know is that at any time it could bring down hundreds of thousands of tonnes of debris
9243596 the chap who passed away was having difficulty with his life jacket while in the water was overwhelmed by the conditions and died
9243597 whether it was through drowning or a heart attack will be established at a post mortem
9243598 mis compa eros lo han dado todo que es lo que quer a y por ello algunos los que tienen menos reprise lo han pagado
9243599 porque el recorrido era muy t cnico la etapa desde luego no era nada f cil
9243600 las diferencias son m nimas y teniendo en cuenta todo lo que queda de carrera no hay que darle mayor importancia
9243601 yo al lado de este no llego a la altura de sus zapatillas contador sin duda es el favorito de esta vuelta
9243602 el haber quedado unos segundos por delante de los favoritos ya es para sentirse contentos
9243603 desde que concluy el tour no he entrenado nada s lo lo justo para no pasarlo mal
9243604 desde que termin el tour no he entrenado nada o casi nada bueno lo justo para venir aqu y no pasarlo mal
9243605 me han puesto un caramelo delante porque el final me viene como anillo al dedo pero no me mover estar por all pero no para luchar por el triunfo de entrada porque no estoy al cien por cien y luego porque si me meto tambi n tendr a que entrar ma ana y pasado y al siguiente no no quiero meterme en el l o prefiero probar en la segunda semana
9243606 la idea es llegar al mundial con ganas y encontrarme psicol gicamente fresco aqu vengo sin presi n y si me la ponen la evitar y eso que cuento con un equipo bastante mejor que en el tour horrillo y flecha estar n conmigo uno o dos d as pero el resto del tiempo podr n ir por libre mi objetivo aqu es preparar el mundial
9243607 conozco el recorrido y me va bien tendr posibilidades pero todo depender de mi
9243608 s lo conozco compartimos el gimnasio y tambi n conozco a carolina no tengo nada con l aunque reconozco que es una excelente persona

9243633 i love guitar hero and i think its a part of pop culture i would love to do a guitar hero movie if activision would ever let me im trying to convince them but why would you have a movie screw up such a huge franchise not that i would make a bad movie so that would be cool to do a guitar hero movie
9243634 it could be about a kid from a small town who dreams of being a rock star and he wins the guitar hero competition one of these dreams come true kind of concepts
9243635 no puede haber incertidumbre hemos de salir a por el partido debemos tener claro que es un lujo jugar en primera y se nos tiene que notar en la manera de vivir y de afrontar el encuentro
9243636 deberemos estar muy atentos cuando el villarreal tenga el bal n porque es un rival de much sima calidad
9243637 tenemos ausencias importantes pero nuestro plantel es lo suficientemente potente como para sacar los compromisos adelante
9243638 si queremos hacer algo en la liga hay que hacerlo desde la primera jornada y no empezar a pelear en marzo o abril hay que empezar con el pie derecho
9243639 es el que ha tocado y hay que ganar y convencer porque en la liga hay que ir paso a paso y no nos queda otra opci n que estar listos para este partido y hacernos con los tres puntos
9243640 las sensaciones de la pretemporada han sido buenas y estoy seguro de que lo haremos bien pero los inicios siempre son complicados es un partido especial obviamente no hay que dramatizar porque la liga no se ganar en soria en caso de triunfo ni tampoco se perder si perdemos
9243641 lo que tenemos que hacer es trabajar y jugar como sabemos ante el wisla pasara lo que pasara no bamos a ganar la champions pero s que pod amos perderla y en el c mputo de la eliminatoria hicimos un buen papel luchamos hasta el final tratamos de empatar a pesar de que en la primera parte con un ojo mir bamos la porter a rival y con el otro tratamos de defender nuestro marco estoy satisfecho porque de ninguna manera fuimos a polonia a pasearnos no obstante centramos toda la pretemporada en el partido de champions y quiz s descuidamos la liga pero que nadie dude que nuestra intenci n es la de ganar para meternos cuanto antes en una din mica positiva buscando una inercia
9243642 somos favoritos a ganar la liga siempre es complicado hacer pron sticos pero est claro que nosotros somos uno de los favoritos al campeonato no creo que el madrid sea el gran favorito pero s candidato el camino determinar lo que debe pasar si nos ganan ser porque no hacemos bien nuestro trabajo
9243643 creo que todo el equipo ha jugado bien no s lo yo los titulares y los del banquillo
9243644 ese es uno de mis mejores recuerdos de mi etapa en el bar a junto con el debut claro
9243645 es uno de los mejores equipos del mundo y tiene a los mejores jugadores del mundo as que no hay sitio para todos
9243646 es un honor haber estado con jugadores como ellos y sobretodo ver que pueden triunfar en un equipo como el bar a
9243647 va a ser un encuentro dif cil estamos trabajando con ilusi n para obtener algo positivo
9243648 lo celebrar porque la satisfacci n personal de debutar en primera y lograr un gol
9243649 la primera parte ha sido un atasco apenas hab a juego el partido no era fluido
9243650 ellos han jugado con tres futbolistas de contenci n que nos han dificultado mucho el juego en esos primeros cuarenta y cinco minutos
9243651 la segunda parte ha sido m s clara no ha habido el atasco anterior en el juego a los jugadores les he dicho en el descanso que hubiera m s movimientos porque en la primera mitad no hab a pasado casi nada
9243652 me siento bien contento el equipo ha trabajado bien mi objetivo era este partido luego ya tendremos tiempo para valorar las incorporaciones
9243653 sab amos que iba a ser un encuentro complicado porque el valladolid es un equipo muy fuerte con muchos apoyos ya esperaba que el partido pudiera transcurrir por unos cauces parecidos a lo que ha deparado
9243654 yo no he mirado la edad antes de decidir los cambios necesit bamos un refuerzo en el centro del campo y le he dado entrada sin m s
9243655 el valladolid ha hecho un cambio ofensivo pero en l neas generales hemos tocado mejor el bal n los minutos finales han sido bastante embarullados sab amos que iba a ser muy complicado pero hemos sabido contener el l gico empuje de un rival que arriesga
9243656 no podemos estar contentos ninguno de los dos entrenadores con el juego de nuestros equipos en la primera mitad
9243657 ten amos que estar centrados en el partido hasta el lunes no hablaremos del tema de las incorporaciones
9243658 han estado excelentes ambos son muy buenos futbolistas que pueden aportar mucho a nuestro equipo
9243659 were facing what could be a very strong hurricane possibly one of the largest and strongest to hit america since records began
9243660 the rain is not so intense but there is a lot a lot of wind
9243661 the officials they have told us the wind will be bad first but then the rain could cause flooding into the night
9243662 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9243663 he has been co operating with investigators and weve had the opportunity to sit down with him and get his version of the events
9243664 with a green mp sitting in the house of commons it will now be impossible to exclude the green party from the televised leaders debates in the next election
9243665 our view is there should only be one liberal candidate in the leaders debate
9243666 you cant have two candidates from essentially the same party in the debate
9243667 the environment has always been the biggest issue in my riding and i think that in the next election the environment will be the top issue nationally as well
9243668 whether listeria was the actual cause or the underlying cause is very difficult to determine
9243669 we will very likely see more cases linked to the outbreak given the time frames involved for symptoms to show up and testing to occur
9243670 many of our recalls relate to products such as sandwiches and pre packaged meats carrying best before dates that have now already expired
9243671 nevertheless in the public interest and in the interest of openness we feel it is important that such info is visible

9243675 we were just getting the house back together getting it started cleaning up after hurricane katrina and we had to evacuate again
9243676 we just pray for both of them and for everyone whos struggling to get out or whos not able to
9243677 here i stand 3 years later on the anniversary not as an evacuee but im here to help people to give the reception arkansas gave to us
9243678 were going to need a lot of help to be able to house that many people
9243679 what this means to me basically is an opportunity to show the love of jesus christ
9243680 the least little bit of rain we get now it floods so were just hoping for the best praying for the best
9243681 like i said we practice monthly we talk to people all the time we give people an opportunity to ask questions to practice to learn more about the system
9243682 what we found was everybody wanted to come and help and so as it continued for days we were all really worn out
9243683 we train for these kinds of scenarios all the time what makes this one different is we got a little notice
9243684 to be able to help communities when theyre in their most vulnerable hours is a wonderful feeling
9243685 hopkins sufri un desplazamiento de un m sculo intercostal en la ca da en brno hace dos semanas y aunque la herida parec a mejorar durante esta ltima semana la agrav accidentalmente el jueves por la noche por su seguridad se ha decidido que no subiera a la moto porque la distracci n por la lesi n combinada con la falta de sue o podr a haber dificultado su concentraci n en pista
9243686 y aunque cada ronda que paso me da m s opciones de terminar el a o en el n mero uno el objetivo ahora es dar lo mejor y llegar lo m s lejos posible
9243687 si el objetivo es llegar lejos mejor pasar la primera semana sin sufrir demasiado sin desgastarse mucho
9243688 es lo importante seguir mejorando d a a d a a medida que avanza el torneo

9243709 o minist rio da educa o disse que j tem os professores suficientes para o sistema educativo 120 mil mas n o levou em conta as reas onde o sistema insuficiente como o pr escolar o secund rio que precisa de mais alunos ou a educa o especial
9243710 no pr escolar e no 1 ciclo n o houve uma nica contrata o
9243711 a senhora ministra j disse v rias vezes que o minist rio da educa o n o um centro de emprego mas a verdade que est a transform lo num centro de desemprego at os professores dos quadros est o a ficar de fora
9243712 porque os professores nas escolas est o sobrecarregados at com hor rios ilegais
9243713 antes devido ao fen meno da guerra civil os direitos humanos n o eram observados mas agora com a paz e com a normaliza o da vida pol tica a esperan a que temos vai no sentido de melhorar a situa o
9243714 os direitos humanos passar o a ser mais tidos em conta
9243715 s com mais rg os de comunica o social os jornalistas poder o com maior abrang ncia abordar as quest es ligadas aos direitos humanos e isso muito bom para o desenvolvimento e democratiza o de angola
9243716 era constitu da por deputados que sa ram da guerra e nada tinham a ver com o povo
9243717 no parlamento que agora termina a legislatura existia uma comiss o cuja voca o era fazer respeitar os direitos humanos mas na pr tica isso n o foi o que se verificou havendo muitos atropelos
9243718 onde os partidos pol ticos est o a ser muito t midos na sua actua o
9243719 mas em angola esses t tulos apenas favorecem os interesses de quem os financia e nada t m a ver com os direitos humanos respondem unicamente aos interesses de quem paga
9243720 a independ ncia dos rg os de informa o est longe de acontecer no pa s estando condenada por mais algum tempo a um segundo plano a favor de quem det m o poder financeiro havendo por isso manipula o da informa o
9243721 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
9243722 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
9243723 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
9243724 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
9243725 how do you know some nigger with a cut lip didnt drink from that
9243726 if there is any dna evidence that would be a surprise to me
9243727 i cant comment on any evidence that may be out there
9243728 we have a lot of evidence and the connection between so many cases of dna will allow us to eventually solve this
9243729 the day those tests came in we realised we had a serial killer on our hands who has been active for 23 years
9243730 he could be some computer nerd out there for all we know
9243731 it could be anybody in this case it has gone on so long we have to be open to any possibility
9243732 this guy is out there working i was not expecting that
9243733 he wrapped it himself in aluminum foil and red rope
9243734 she just said i got a place she was really excited whoever she was going to stay with she felt she was safe
9243735 leaving us out of the loop about something so important boggles the mind
9243736 we should have some awareness that it is going on again nobody came to us
9243737 this is a pretty small area in south los angeles we have been talking to the prostitutes for years the word is out that the police are out there
9243738 how come they havent involved the community there are no fliers or nothing in order for us to work on it to stop it we have to be all inclusive and involve everybody we have to flood the neighborhood this is serious we need to have a press conference to talk about it
9243739 it is almost hush hush the authorities act like the parents of those kids dont exist
9243740 i have wanted this case solved so i can get on with my life i want to know who killed my baby
9243741 it is not something that will all of a sudden crack thousands of cases
9243742 if it is a lead if you have a killer at large if it can help we want to work with the agency
9243743 and i would venture to say that this is probably half of what he has done
9243744 if we didnt catch him he would have called his own news conference he wanted to be in the hall of fame of serial killers
9243745 rader would go for a year or two without killing
9243746 then he would go dormant again for almost 10 years
9243747 a big mess they didnt put forth any effort the detectives didnt show no aggressiveness about it
9243748 that was what was told to us she supposedly got into a rust or orange colored hatchback she was tough it was possible she might have not known him
9243749 the low profile media coverage and problems with the investigation are all examples of womens lives not counting and black prostitute women counting least of all
9243750 it was something she said that convinced him and he dropped her off
9243751 after he was arrested it stopped there werent any killings anymore
9243752 you would think that somebody involved in those activities would have been arrested and had a dna sample taken
9243753 it could be we arent connecting the cases i am sure we dont have a lab report for everything he has done there could be other cases that he has done that could drastically eliminate the gap
9243754 the stress can be a motivator a bad day at work or a fight with your wife
9243755 i have to think the worst that he is going to continue it has been going on for 23 years at least
9243756 come on 23 years thats a lifetime we need to stop this person
9243757 you dont just get into your car and drive to aruba i am really starting to have a problem with it why wouldnt you offer rewards i guess no council member is really interested i am just a mother who wishes they would say something about my daughter like they say about every other kid
9243758 we arent talking to the media and that is that
9243759 a year ago we werent sure if there was going to be a flurry of murders again
9243760 i dont think it will harm us to acknowledge this i dont think we are hiding a secret that there is a night stalker out there
9243761 we are trying to get answers from them and hopefully get the right answer soon
9243762 it will take old fashioned police work we just cant wait for brown to give us a link
9243763 is a family man or goes home to his wife or kids we might never find him
9243764 is going to be one of those cold cases they never solve
9243765 hes a guy with a mindset who is smart enough to back off and wait i dont think he has left he can start this mess all over again
9243766 if him lef prison a kill wi ago kill him dem beta mek him dead in deh

9243802 se puede pensar en un sistema como el del torneo de tenis de wimbledon all los espectadores que dejan la cancha devuelven sus entradas que son vendidas nuevamente a un precio m s reducido

9243819 after the end of the omonia aek game and despite the fact that everything had proceeded smoothly both in the arrival and departure of the supporters and while people were celebrating the victory of their team shortly after the end of the red star belgrade apoel match some other people perhaps incited by their own reasons chose to blacken the victory of their team
9243820 wearing hoods and helmets and carrying iron bars they flooded makarios avenue and caused severe damage to cars passing by but also to a particular caf
9243821 these incidents have saddened me because whereas the whole of cyprus should be celebrating the victory of these teams these people chose to blacken their teams victory in this particular way

9243832 after the end of the omonia aek game and despite the fact that everything had proceeded smoothly both in the arrival and departure of the supporters and while people were celebrating the victory of their team shortly after the end of the red star belgrade apoel match some other people perhaps incited by their own reasons chose to blacken the victory of their team
9243833 wearing hoods and helmets and carrying iron bars they flooded makarios avenue and caused severe damage to cars passing by but also to a particular caf
9243834 these incidents have saddened me because whereas the whole of cyprus should be celebrating the victory of these teams these people chose to blacken their teams victory in this particular way

9243853 lick the palm of your hand so that your balls dont swell
9243854 abba rocks anyone who says otherwise is probably mourning too deeply over the loss of george carlin and needs to be kicked while theyre down
9243855 alan moore you wrote my favorite issues of radioactive man
9243856 oh really so you liked that i made your favorite superhero a heroin addicted jazz critic whos not radioactive
9243857 i dont read the words i just like when he punches people
9243858 i heard you get on it married and when you get off it youre single
9243859 a full nelson that wont work on me im radditz
9243860 a paul nelson that wont work on me im radditz
9243861 come on now give it your best shot maybe then itll be a real battle
9243862 we are working on reviewing existing policies and procedures and making changes and more will be implemented in weeks to come
9243863 we interviewed him in detail in regard to the escape and we believe that we still have a great deal of momentum in our search for the other four
9243864 law enforcement officers are receiving multiple tips through the crime stoppers hotline and those working the investigation around the clock are very optimistic that they are making progress and getting close to the remaining four escapees
9243865 courage is not the absence of fear but rather the judgment that something else is more important than fear
9243866 i think everybody thinks the same thing it wont happen to me
9243867 all the food borne illnesses that are floating around this country of ours theres anger toward that that canadians have to be subjected to this type of lackadaisical attitude toward food safety
9243868 i want her death to be counted and for people to know this is a real hazard out there
9243869 whether listeria was the actual cause or the underlying cause is very difficult to determine
9243870 many of our recalls relate to products such as sandwiches and pre packaged meats carrying best before dates that have now already expired
9243871 nevertheless in the public interest and in the interest of openness we feel it is important that such info is visible
9243872 he was known in the neighborhood as someone who was off his rocker when he got mad
9243873 didnt look suspicious because we saw him all the time he played us he knew that area
9243874 society tends to focus on dramatic explosions of violence against people with whom they identify
9243875 it usually fails to stimulate much public outrage there might even be in some peoples minds some kind of moral difference drawn
9243876 their addiction made them an invisible class on the fringes of society
9243877 i never thought that he was that kind of person
9243878 you have to deal with those things i knew he had problems but i never thought he would go out and kill people
9243879 i thinks its a very important issue something everyone in the community should be concerned about these people are our friends family and neighbors
9243880 we could have done it earlier but we chose this timing right before the city council meeting
9243881 it doesnt mean thats what we want but well take it well make it work
9243882 from what i understand what will go is the transportation side and two part time employees and thats not good
9243883 some of us have to buy groceries for a whole month and you cant buy that
9243884 were appreciative for what we get dont get us wrong were very appreciative but to get rid of skilled staff theyre needed they are a necessity no matter what the city council thinks theyre needed
9243885 i would welcome some other creative contributions to this i think they are going to be necessary in the future
9243886 but at this point i feel very comfortable that we can preserve this program to the satisfaction of the folks who live there
9243887 our organization was set up to look for injustices in the criminal justice system
9243888 and when we see potential injustices as glaring as those in this case how can we refuse to take it
9243889 we hope and anticipate that individuals with relevant information about the case will continue to come forward
9243890 we also hope the department of justice will publicly identify a contact person so that we can provide important information to those who are examining the prosecutions case
9243891 its been more than 10 years since i have held him outside prison walls
9243892 we are able to demonstrate to the public the importance of crop diversification while at the same time continuing our own research
9243893 lewis and clark ate it while on their expedition but it doesnt taste very good
9243894 any way we can get people out here to learn is beneficial
9243895 were keeping our fingers crossed right now for oil prices as well as those in the path of the hurricane
9243896 gasoline prices could go down if the hurricane peters out or hits an area that isnt central to oil and natural gas production
9243897 but if it hits crucial areas for oil we could see some more increases
9243898 i guess im surprised there are still so many people out there who havent done it
9243899 its hard to reach out because unless theyre affiliated with a senior center or some other group its hard to get the word out to them
9243900 they may think its too late but its not too late
9243901 our goal is to make sure that individuals get their money in their hands as fast as they can and make sure that they know that they are eligible to receive that money
9243902 i wish to humbly apologize to society for my crime
9243903 every human life is sacred i took the life of a human being and im very sorry for that

9243906 there is mold on the floor tracking in the shower and paint chips coming off the shower
9243907 the maintenance did come over and said yep thats mold
9243908 when i go in the shower there is also mold behind the paint that is chipping and it falls in my familys hair and is making me sick
9243909 no the 30 days isnt firm wed work with her on that as long as she moves
9243910 after ewa was here she investigated and said she saw the mold so well have to go over and do something about it
9243911 el origen del nombre indaliano se atribuye a d juan cuadrado quien un d a present un dolo prehist rico era una estatuilla que representaba un rostro sonriente con incisiones representando barba bigote cejas y pesta as con una curiosa copa como sombrero donde part a una pluma o penca este falso dolo se tomo como amuleto de la tertulia y por su parecido con el conocido de un contertulio llamado indalecio se le denomin indalo
9243912 mas tarde fue descubierto que el tal dolo nada ten a de prehist rico sino que lo hab an hecho unos gitanos fue entonces cuando el arque logo d juan cuadrado tom conocimiento de un dibujo en la cueva de los letreros v lez blanco que representaba una figura humana con los brazos extendidos y unidos por un arco y las piernas abiertas este s mbolo se tom como emblema y recibi el nombre del dolo
9243913 perceval tom este ltimo significado apoy ndose en los indalos aparecidos en moj car
9243914 examinamos las pinturas que quedaban hoy son menos crey ver en una la figura del indalo y yo le hice notar que parec a la estilizaci n de un hombre con el arco tensado para disparar

9243917 i was just trying to put my glove on it and do anything to prevent it from getting by me
9243918 i didnt ever feel like we had a chance to turn it i gave it a shot at first and we got him
9243919 he made an unbelievable play i dont know how he made that play let alone get two outs on it
9243920 i think he might have been just a little too far away to do a shovel pass
9243921 it was a little low but thats a play hes made many times before
9243922 we need to win some games and maybe spoil some people
9243923 its nice to do some good things and get a win out of it
9243924 you dont want to hurt them but if we need them we need them
9243925 its real disappointing but that was a game we needed to win
9243926 thats an unfortunate loss for us because thats a game we have to win
9243927 i didnt think in spring training that id be part of anything like that
9243928 i wanted to but i didnt think it was a possibility sometimes you get things that you dont expect so it was nice
9243929 i know that everybody feels especially happy for him he looks really comfortable out there and i like that
9243930 little bit of nervousness in my first game in my hometown
9243931 thirty people here to see me and i just let it overwhelm me
9243932 i think were making it a whole lot more difficult than we should
9243933 i just love it because its everyones art coming together its really interesting because i just love seeing handmade jewelry and stuff its cool
9243934 kipona is great so far this year were having a good time and shes getting ready to get on a few of the rides its not too hot were having fun arent we jules yeah hi five
9243935 what we found out is that the petroleum dealers can actually look at the demographics of a region and zone price it
9243936 i know i can get gas here 5 to 10 cents cheaper than in other places so i come here
9243937 you shouldnt be penalized because of the way you pay or where you live
9243938 we needed to put up some runs weve got the offensive power to do it and we showed it tonight
9243939 i thought it could be better and it was i had command of all my pitches
9243940 if i had made one movewe might have won the game
9243941 you always want to contribute and sometimes regardless if you win or lose just going out there and throwing quality innings up there gives your team a chance
9243942 for whatever reason thats where the streak has come from
9243943 he was changing speeds spotting the ball well on the attack
9243944 any time youre going to have success its going to be because you got good starting pitching and your defense is good
9243945 any time youre part of something thats a first especially since im a big brewers fanatic now its an honor to have that title
9243946 hes done a phenomenal job all year and youve got to figure that at some point hes going to hit a bump in the road because everyone does
9243947 when you throw the ball down the middle i dont care who youre playing its not going to get major league hitters out
9243948 for the first few innings every time i tried to pitch inside it was right down the middle camerons home run was right down the middle sure theyre a good hitting team but when you throw pathetic pitches it really doesnt work
9243949 the most important thing at this point in the season is to continue to find ways to play well youve got to play tough every day were doing that right now
9243950 its one of those situations where youre trying to do your best and you come in against a lot of good hitters
9243951 its nothing to disrespect the opponent its just the fact that you get into a situation that you want to do your best and on top of that i got one of my hometown friends geovany soto
9243952 i had a huge at bat there in the eighth inning and didnt come through
9243953 its part of the game sometimes you hit a big homer and you kind of stand there and look and enjoy the success at that moment i think it was a big strikeout for him
9243954 i had a good year get hurt then have a bad year then dont play one year then turn into a platoon kind of a bench player all of a sudden hopefully this sets me back in the right direction
9243955 we just squandered too many opportunities and left a lot of people on base
9243956 the home plate umpire said that he wasnt tagged the first base umpire said he was tagged in the hip
9243957 one of them was right and one of them was wrong
9243958 unable to display full directory path when trying to edit a layer where the app was installed on drive other than c
9243959 your current security settings do not allow this file to be downloaded
9243960 he got a fastball up to bruce and he put a backup slider right in pattersons wheelhouse we had the matchups taschner couldnt make a pitch
9243961 its gotta be location because the stuff is still there
9243962 im throwing beach balls up there ive not gotten anyone out its embarrassing that we score that many runs and cant get a win
9243963 i was trying to calm myself down i thought i relaxed very well after that
9243964 that was one of the best seven innings weve had from our young pitchers this year maybe the best
9243965 antes que nada analisa tu ordenador en busca de virus
9243966 thats my motto a walks as good as a hit and i showed them today you dont always have to get a hit sometimes a walk will beat a team too
9243967 they worked the count a full count and were able to lay off some tough pitches when those times a lot of people just want to get the hit to win it
9243968 theyve been playing with a lot of confidence of late
9243969 right now theyre just flying high they think they can come back and our offense is clicking
9243970 a lot of players arent lucky enough to play this long but i have been that lucky and relatively healthy during that run and able to produce
9243971 any kind of longevity record is a feather in your cap ive had a pretty good career to be standing besides eddie mathews in another category is quite an honor
9243972 you feel like youve got the game won were up 4 0 6 2
9243973 then whatevers been happening all year reared its ugly head again we couldnt get anyone out it cost us the game
9243974 my job is to defuse a situation rather than ignite it
9243975 no matter what you throw there hes going to get it
9243976 i get opportunities to walk him to face big papi i will do it
9243977 i felt the same as i did the last time against them
9243978 you go through times in the year where youre not very good and then you go through times when you are good
9243979 the last couple of days i got on base every time so its just one of those things
9243980 i know so much stress its tough on her to watch this stuff
9243981 she reminds me of mira stupica our greatest actress drama is her speciality
9243982 i wish i didnt have any drama in my matches i wish i could cruise win nice and simple
9243983 i dont have anything to do with the top side it makes no difference until if i go to the final
9243984 no it was good as long as im doing the splits that means im healthy when i cant i know somethings wrong that im not sure about my body if i go into a split who knows if ill come back up
9243985 if you want to beat zheng you have to beat her to the end
9243986 and you know moehlers going to battle he ended up pitching a great game for us you know hes a gutsy guy and hes aggressive and going to give us a chance we just had to get some runs for him
9243987 im an old man and i saw it with my natural eyes
9243988 that took a run off the board for us and probably at least a double away from a kid whos scratching for hits
9243989 i knew it short hopped me and i popped up like i caught it i knew it was a short hop i also knew it was a tough one it was up to the umpire and it was a tough call for him to make
9243990 thats not his game or anybodys game and he got it up and got nailed
9243991 basically the guys put three runs on the board for me and if i did my job we would have had a good chance to win the game
9243992 i just had to make an adjustment and get the ball down i kept trying to pound the strike zone and get ahead and i was just missing a lot and falling behind when you do that theyre going to make you pay
9243993 why not just have a superintelligence that answers human questions instead of acting autonomously in the world
9243994 why not just have the ai answer questions instead of trying to do anything then it wouldnt need to be friendly it wouldnt need any goals at all it would just answer questions
9243995 what is the code of an ai that always does the right thing
9243996 well just keep the ai in a solid box so it cant have any effects on the world except by how it talks to the humans
9243997 okay so well just give the ai the goal of not having any effects on the world except from how it answers questions sure that requires some fai work but the goal system as a whole sounds much simpler than your coherent extrapolated volition thingy
9243998 yeah sure if it has any effect on the world apart from talking to the programmers through the legitimately defined channel the utility function assigns that infinite negative utility whats wrong with that
9243999 we can make an 8 1 game as exciting as anything in the world
9244000 we do probably have to find out what we can do to be a little more consistent than we have been
9244001 weve got to come out sunday and win too we cant lose that many more games and we know that
9244002 a walkoff anything ranks high because that means your team wins the game
9244003 you load the bases and hopefully you get a groundball and give your infielders a chance to go home and maybe turn two if its hit hard enough
9244004 you just have to keep working working working and eventually its going to turn around
9244005 i hit him with two strikes so i actually did him a favor
9244006 the best way to respond is with the bats and we did
9244007 it feels good anytime you can help the team win
9244008 weve been battling i like the way weve been doing that
9244009 i hit it in the right place where nobody was standing and it worked out
9244010 raul ibanez is probably one of the most underrated players in the game
9244011 people shouldnt be afraid of their governments governments should fear their people
9244012 we got punched in the mouth early we got some good looks but we couldnt make a shot really bailed us out in the first half because he made a couple of threes when we didnt have any offense at all
9244013 to go from 11 point lead to three means we did not perform very well down the stretch
9244014 we made some big free throws down the stretch but give them credit they made some shots that we pretty well guarded
9244015 you always want the win but i was happier with the way we competed
9244016 we played really well basically the last 35 minutes of the game i really didnt know if our team could win this game because we dont have our guys meaning the morris twins but certainly they responded well
9244017 we came out and did what we needed to do on the defensive end
9244018 we started out slow and coach got after us and after a few time outs we finally picked it up
9244019 on the womens side i would say it was pretty dominating they all really looked good on the mens side there was really good competition we had some people who really stepped up and got the job done were excited about the total team effort on both squads
9244020 ive been running at rim rock since i was all the way back in high school and it was my first win out here so thats really special for me
9244021 that was definitely exciting our team did really well today i think were in a really good spot for the start of the season i think its going to go really well this year its just really exciting to see such a good start and im really pumped for the rest of the year now
9244022 when you talk about 1 2 thats a great place to finish but more important than that you have your three four and five finish not too far behind thats what makes a great team and those are the signs of a great team and were starting to get those things together
9244023 following recent assessment we found that she hasnt been performing very well in her duties so thats why we asked her to step down from her post
9244024 we have made it clear that anyone not performing will be dealt with accordingly and she was no exception
9244025 caryn really had a great game and moved the ball around well
9244026 the upperclassmen really held it together this afternoon and we had two solid games
9244027 caryn really had a great game and moved the ball around well and laira is starting to show that she is regaining full strength in her knee
9244028 allows california to grow but in a way that is consistent with our environmental goals
9244029 gas prices certainly may have an impact on growth patterns but i think thats only one piece of it
9244030 im not confident that the current state of gas prices alone will combat sprawl
9244031 this is not about mandating where people live but it is about urging our cities and counties about being more thoughtful about where people live
9244032 is that you dont have to get up early like bird watchers butterflies need at least 17c to start flying and that means theyre not about until 10am and then at their most active at midday and in the afternoon when its hottest
9244033 which will be decisive for the future of air tahiti nui
9244034 but a small change in behavior can make a big difference
9244035 id hate to have the store bagger ask do you want to double bag that and then be thinking about whether i want to spend the extra 20 cents
9244036 we need programs that combine practical lessons from the government with the educational rigor of universities it is worrying to see public servants not taking on further training in our state run universities and it already having an adverse impact on timely delivery of goods and services to the rural people
9244037 this is part of the overall public sector reforms initiated by the government and that is the entry level into the public service and such makes this program unique and challenging
9244038 we are looking now at developing graduates for the public service
9244039 today is a kind of epiphany because we might have a solution for at least one state
9244040 i believe the 2001 roadless rule to be one of the most effective conservation measures of our time however conservation cannot endure if the people most affected by it dont support it
9244041 we are proud of the way we manage our own state lands and our own private lands
9244042 they own two out of every three acres in idaho
9244043 if you look at the substance its frankly not hugely different from the clinton rule of 2001 what is different is the messenger
9244044 in 2001 we had a democratic president telling idaho that 9 3 million acres of their landscape was going to be managed a specific way
9244045 its been great to learn about the experiences of our body shop trainers and relate it back to our experiences and ways in the solomons
9244046 we now appeal to the government to support us and any other young people in using what we have learned we cant do it without you
9244047 this course has given us the tools of the trade to go out and realize out potential
9244048 ich h tte die mercedes nicht so stark erwartet es ist ausgeglichen jeweils vier autos beider marken in den punkten jeweils ein jahreswagen

9244050 das auto muss gerade hier sowohl mit gebrauchten als auch mit neuen reifen funktionieren die audi waren tendenziell auf den long runs besser aber mercedes war nicht weit weg
9244051 ganz generell sch tze ich sogar mercedes im rennen etwas st rker ein

9244054 chiss perch mentre in altri ambiti queste problematiche sembrano superate ormai da tempo tutto il lavoro di elaborazione storico critica fatto sul modernismo e il postmodernismo tanto per citare un esempio in campo musicale si assiste periodicamente a un ritorno al passato

9244058 ecco io credo che come per tutte le cose unabitudine allascolto della musica contemporanea sfaterebbe la sua presunta difficolt
9244059 dire che le avanguardie musicali dal serialismo in poi non siano musica che siano una parentesi da dimenticare il prima possibile unenormit
9244060 music is a phisical phenomena you dont need to think when you listen if you think you dont listen
9244061 i have nothing to say and i say it and this is poetry
9244062 you dont need to say things necessarily if you think things hard enough other people would sense it and this is an important statement for music
9244063 stockausen sosteneva di essere andato a scuola su sirio e non lo diceva in senso metaforico ma con la massima seriet su sirio era stato investito della missione di portare allumanit la vera buona musica me lo ricordo a darmstadt nel 1957 lui teenva un corso io ero l come studente con una borsa dis tudio il suo corso fu straordinario
9244064 non ci fornisce delle risposte sicure ma ci indica immaginificamente uno dei tanti percorsi espressivi possibili
9244065 mi chiedo come mai a comprare i cd di stockhausen siano oramai pi i ragazzini cresciuti a pane e
9244066 sulle molte direzioni che ha preso la musica contemporanea e in particolare quella elettroacustica il discorso sarebbe veramente lungo da fare magari si potrebbe pensare di dedicare una serie di articoli su ni allargomento

9244069 la tendenza quella di decontestualizzare oggetti di modernariato elettronico e informatico come le console dei videogiochi tipo game boy per inserirli in un contesto diciamo cos musicale
9244070 camerette di una generazione cresciuta a pane e computer e musicalmente onnivora
9244071 servono tanti don chisciotte per ribaltare lo slogan imperante il business tutto
9244072 the excitement is because we have a quality opponent in mississippi state its on national television and its the season opener these are the types of games we want to be in as a program how we will fair we will find out
9244073 weve had a terrific run with the kids that have been in the program that have won national championships but theyve all left us
9244074 to see the change in leadership and the emergence of the leadership we sense a whole new excitement
9244075 i feel good about it if it were up to me im in

9244323 i dont really care about that the rankings to be honest with you i wanted us to get our feet wet i wanted us to see what kind of team we had at least to this point and i wanted us to get a victory we accomplished what we needed to accomplish today but we do have a long way to go
9244324 like i was saying the other day were just like everybody else were kind of feeling our way to see what we have find out where our weaknesses are and try to improve so the next time well play well play better but we played pretty good
9244325 this is going to affect us a lot because jeff was our leader
9244326 hes the one who got us motivated and got us hyped up for the game losing him is huge but were going to step up for him and make him proud

9244335 the 8 0 run out of the gate was a huge sense of comfort it is always nice to start strong and finish strong im proud of the team for executing

9244471 much of the old confusion we deplore in political theory and much of the fresh confusion we spread when trying to get rid of what has been spread springs from false notions of what rationality is and what it does

9244570 nos permite sacar la voz y no s lo depender de los medios para llevar nuestro mensaje y punto de vista
9244571 yo dije d jame poner un calendario porque sal a un aviso de una exhibici n un s lo d a en los medios y si no lo viste no te enteraste empec de manera informal mandando copias del calendario a amistades y enlaz ndolos con otros recursos
9244572 por eso surge este proyecto de autogesti n para producir esa documentaci n mayormente fotogr fica y que sea accesible econ micamente
9244573 hay cosas relevantes que se est n dejando atr s no estamos diciendo que esa informaci n se oculta sino que es valiosa tiene relevancia social y no se est documentando
9244574 la cr tica especializada est en crisis no la hay como tampoco hay espacios discursivos ni te ricos estos espacios son para eso
9244575 es una variaci n de otros blogs pero tiene la misma intenci n y a la misma vez quiere jugar con el medio las voces son bien heterog neas hablan los artistas los cr ticos los coleccionistas la pregunta es para todo el mundo y responde todo el que quiera busco identificar lo ltimo qui nes lo est n haciendo y qu cambios se avecinan en el mundo del arte
9244576 vimos la parte negativa del comentario abierto primero comentas como an nimo y luego atacas a los artistas y no al argumento eso nos pareci injusto ahora tenemos un email por si quieren comunicarse
9244577 y lo m s incre ble es que est n entrando personas de otros pa ses que no hablan espa ol o ingl s cuando miramos las estad sticas muchas de esas entradas son traducidas v a google o altavista eso nos interesa
9244578 diariamente entran a la p gina entre 70 a 80 personas
9244579 y cuando se hizo la exposici n 05 08 tuvimos visitas de estados unidos espa a m xico colombia inglaterra suiza egipto y hasta de india cuando hay enlaces a otros lugares sirve de trampol n inclusive hago enlaces a rese as buenas y malas sa es la din mica de la cr tica del arte el portal no tiene espacio para comentarios sino para enviar emails y lo que he recibido ha sido superpositivo
9244580 est n como el arroz y la habichuela en todas partes no se quiten as nos dimos cuenta de que nos estaban leyendo despu s empezaron a comentar y vimos un aumento en las visitas esto es un trabajo por amor al arte no se sostiene solo tiene que ser con un segundo y tercer trabajo
9244581 no sabemos cu nta gente est visitando la p gina porque no miramos esos n meros no tenemos auspiciadores que pregunten pero muchas personas se nos acercan en las exposiciones para felicitarnos por el trabajo lo malo es que no podemos ir a todo los eventos que quisi ramos cuando hay cosas de artistas j venes las visitas aumentan hemos llegado a tener de italia y hasta jap n
9244582 hay algo que raya en la obsesi n de contribuir y cambiar las cosas en el mundo del arte de abrir m s espacios y mantener un compromiso fuerte con el arte contempor neo y con los artistas j venes eso vas a ver en los blogs de artistas no es un grupo cerrado hay una din mica de informaci n bien estimulante y eso es importante cuando ha habido controles de instituciones que han manejado la cultura eso se est desplomando con esta manifestaci n
9244583 se ha formado una peque a uni n entre blogers de arte que hasta cierta manera uno apoya al otro y el contenido hace referencia al del otro eso nos ha hecho acaparar un nicho

9244599 he estado leyendo la prensa y utilizar mis remedios y mis derechos para defenderme ante las crasas violaciones constitucionales y legales que ha tratado de realizar el se or luis fortu o
9244600 mundo ha estado diciendo que yo le dije a l que yo le daba mi candidatura y el esca o y eso es mentira
9244601 insinu de parte de fortu o que si yo le ced a mi candidatura y mi esca o ellos se encargar an de todas mis deudas de mantenerme econ micamente no tan s lo desde este momento sino que en enero cuando l se convirtiera en gobernador me dar a carta blanca para cualquier contrato de asesor a que yo solicitara en su gobierno lo juro ante mi madre fallecida
9244602 a la verdad que se volvi loco y estoy dispuesto a someterme a un pol grafo junto a l
9244603 cuando los l deres pol ticos hablan como luis habl el s bado pasado no se dan cuenta de que tiene unos seguidores
9244604 de cualquier cosa que me pase responsabilizo a fortu o y no respondo por el que lo intente estoy en r cord pero el responsable de lo que pase f sicamente a mi persona es fortu o
9244605 el se or edwin mundo el mismo s bado entr en una negociaci n econ mica conmigo que yo no le permit insinu de parte de luis fortu o que si yo le ced a mi candidatura y mi esca o ellos se encargar an de todas mis deudas de mantenerme econ micamente no tan solo desde este momento sino que en enero cuando l fortu o se convirtiera en gobernador me dar a carta abierta para cualquier contrato de asesor a que yo solicitara en su gobierno eso es verdad y lo juro ante mi madre fallecida
9244606 el mismo rivera schatz dec a que sab a de la primera plana el vocero de las posibles investigaciones dos semanas antes y el senador roberto arango sab a lo que estaba pasando desde marzo y yo desde marzo le dije a la fiscal dom nguez y al director del fbi lo que se estaba diciendo porque me estaba muy curioso que rivera schatz y arango tuvieran una informaci n y estuviesen hablando de ella cuando yo sab a que era mentira hasta habl con jueces federales desde marzo yo estaba alertando sobre los inuendos que estaban llevando arango y rivera schatz m s del lado de rivera schatz rivera schatz se atrevi a decir que hab a un gran jurado en mi contra que se reun a los s bados los grandes jurados no se re nen los s bados pero l dec a eso para hacerme da o en la carrera por la presidencia del senado cuando un hombre le dice a otro que est loco y que se tome los medicamentos es porque le tiene miedo y es un cobarde este se or cuando dice eso es porque me tiene miedo y es un cobarde el a o pasado lo llam a la casa cuando se puso a hablar cosas personales y menos l que vive una vida inmoral y mundana eso es de conocimiento p blico en el partido tambi n podr a haber una orden de allanamiento para l pude haber usado como ejemplo un inuendo de l que tiene un hangar con tantos carros antiguos motoras y caballos de paso fino una persona que era fiscal es un cobarde
9244607 ah tienes una expresi n irresponsable este era el abogado de pedro rossell y rivera schatz para que luis fortu o no se convirtiera en candidato a gobernador del pnp ellos ponen a hablar a las mismas personas que intentaron que l no fuera candidato a gobernador por lo tanto las expresiones de sagard a de rivera schatz las expresiones de luis el s bado domingo y lunes me hace pensar que a l lo est n asesorando para que luzca como una persona que no est lista para ser gobernador de puerto rico qu es lo que no dice sagard a que el gran jurado puede ordenar que se corroboren unos testimonios y eso fue lo que hizo el gran jurado van a un juez porque quer an algo que se dice sobre de castro font y el juez lo firm y fueron a allanar los tres sitios donde podr a haber informaci n
9244608 a los nicos que yo escuch hablando barbaridades fue a an bal vega borges y a ram n luis rivera esos dos alcaldes no han estado conmigo nunca los dos entend an que bamos a perder el caso en el tribunal supremo aut nticos y que si gan bamos el caso nos iban a colgar en la papeleta llevan de dos dos si quieren estar de tres tres con mucho gusto nunca han sido amigos m os hay una veintena de alcaldes que ser n citados si pasara lo que yo espero que no pase igual que el alcalde de guaynabo h ctor oneill y el de fajardo an bal mel ndez que son testigos de reputaci n para que le digan al tribunal cu nto dinero me dieron a m por confirmarles a sus amigas amigos a sus familiares etc tera estamos preparados para cualquier circunstancia que se levante en contra nuestra
9244609 francisco besosa quien firm la orden de allanamiento tambi n estar como testigo de reputaci n primero porque es pariente m o y segundo porque yo le confirm a su esposa enid mart nez moya como juez superior antes de ser juez federal

9244715 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
9244716 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
9244717 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
9244718 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
9244719 so if he were to pick governor kaine it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what im really not first and foremost concerned with is this person capable of being president of the united states

9244766 the six totally false talking points that the yes on 8 campaign is trying to use to fire up their target voters
9244767 the abuse of alcohol narcotics and tobacco emotional instability forced marriage self medication dental caries nutritional disorders suicide and accidents
9244768 fostering in students an understanding of their role in protecting the environment and in safeguarding themselves from other health and safety dangers which may be posed by hazardous substances

9244770 all educational programs offered in kindergarten and grades 1 to 12 inclusive in the public school system
9244771 if you believe as i do that no government should be allowed to force churches to perform marriage ceremonies that contradict gods word im asking you to say i do by offering pji a one time tax deductible gift
9244772 theres not a shred of truth in their assertion it is so clearly established in law that clergy and religious organizations have absolute discretion on which marriages to perform and what is within their religious faith that is one of the most solidly established principles in law
9244773 it is unlikely that a court would force clergy to marry same sex couples
9244774 withdraws from legislative power state and federal the exertion of any restraint on the free exercise of religion its purpose is to secure religious liberty in the individual by prohibiting any invasions there by civil authority
9244775 the debate could raise questions about whether its appropriate for the clergy to continue to act as agents of the state in solemnizing marriages under the authority vested in me they could be in a difficult posture to say they can do that but cant act as agents of the state in performing civil unions
9244776 because of the legalization of same sex marriage in massachusetts
9244777 comply with state law requiring that gays be allowed to adopt children
9244778 n othing in the provisions of the adoption statute g l c 210 precludes the joint adoption of a child by two unmarried individuals
9244779 p rior to adoption of the current domestic partnership law the california supreme court had permitted a child to have two female parents upholding the adoption by one woman of her female partners biological child in sharon s v superior court
9244780 the california supreme court considers three broken up lesbian partnerships and finds in each that a child can have two mothers
9244781 petitioner sharon s and her former domestic partner annette f had a child by artificial insemination and both women reared the child annette f was the biological mother when the couple parted ways the sharon s petitioned for independent second parent adoption but the annette f petitioned to block the proceedings last month the california supreme court issued its opinion in favor of the sharon s see 73 p 3d 2 cal rptr 3d 699 it held that 1 termination of a birth parents rights is not a prerequisite to adoption and 2 second parent adoptions are valid under californias adoption laws
9244782 required to provide housing for same sex couples even if it runs counter to church doctrine
9244783 focus on the family action is a new cultural action organization that is completely separate from focus on the family legally
9244784 if you dont trust your representative then find someone else and vote them to represent notice the similarity between the words your interests
9244785 i am very disappointed that the california supreme court by the narrowest of margins would allow their own personal partisan views to get in the way of their duty to uphold the rule of law by thwarting the will of the overwhelming majority of californians who voted in support of proposition 22 i hope that once this constitutional amendment becomes law in november the supreme court will resume its appropriate role of interpreting the law and stop legislating from the bench
9244786 when its a decision people like they say the court is doing the right thing when its a decision they do not like suddenly its judicial activism from the bench

9244789 and neglecting to promote their last album they instead treated fans to some of their best work and deeper album cuts like two thirds of the

9244791 wootens words were i will kill him hell eat a expletive lead bullet ill shoot him if our father got the attorney to help molly
9244792 i heard this death threat my 16 year old son heard it track palin molly heard it as did their small children wooten spoke with his trooper gun on his hip in an extremely intimidating fashion leaving no doubt he is serious about taking someones life who disagrees with him
9244793 my concern is that the publics faith in the troopers will continue to diminish as more residents express concerns regarding the apparent lack of action towards a trooper whom is described by many as a ticking time bomb and a loose cannon
9244794 wooten is my brother in law but this information is forwarded to you objectively
9244795 my wife says i would rather speak to you on the phone than for you to come back here and be killed
9244796 she says id rather you talk on the phone to your children than for them to have no father
9244797 it is expected any person whose case has been finally determined and they have no grounds for remaining in australia should depart
9244798 several residents are now crammed into disaster shelters here in east portland and the weather continues to make the situation worse
9244799 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9244800 so we are monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9244801 i do believe there are other methods to deal with that potential situation so that we recognize and show the gravity of the situation and still do our business
9244802 our helicopters were barely able to fly for most of the day yesterday as it continued raining heavily till 4 p m
9244803 i really didnt know what was going on with beanie
9244804 it got real quiet i was really scared i wanted to run out there to help now were just hoping for the best
9244805 he went down a couple of times last year and was all right
9244806 his spirits were down i think he started thinking too much and freaking himself out thinking it was worse than it was hes a competitive guy im sure hell figure out a way to come back
9244807 you dont like to see your horse go down like that
9244808 but i dont think his injury will have any psychological effect weve got a stable of backs a lot of talent back there beanies our guy it hurts not having him but i think hell be back sooner than later
9244809 we were out there playing all of our guys throughout the course of the game hes the kind of guy we want him to be a 20 to 30 carry guy i dont know what he got but i dont know that he was overused or anything
9244810 we got a chance to put our names on the map
9244811 its a sign of a pretty good football team when you can not play your best and come away with a win particularly in a venue like this
9244812 non bcs teams should get a shot at a championship every year
9244813 we never were able to get the defense a rest because we couldnt move the ball effectively
9244814 we were struggling offensively so i couldnt blame him a bit
9244815 we knew that both of us were going to play and it was going to be based on how coach felt
9244816 there was just a look in everyones eye its not something ive seen in the last couple years of utah football
9244817 the focus is likely to remain on tropical storm gustav and potential supply disruptions during the weekend and earlier next week
9244818 with the us and russia still at logger heads over georgia and credit market issues continuing to send jitters through the financial markets gold remains an attractive choice to longer term investors looking to factor in some safe haven protection
9244819 apart from lead the base metals struggled which points to further consolidation in the near term
9244820 further strength in the oil market amid concerns that tropical storm gustav will disrupt oil and gas production in the gulf of mexico this weekend led to a boost
9244821 weve been able to pick things that offer the biggest value
9244822 a strong indication of the macro environment getting a lot worse
9244823 och wat een pracht wat een geschenk geniet er maar van h
9244824 is het een tweeling goh ze lijken niet op elkaar h hoe kan dat nou waarom kleed je ze niet hetzelfde wel druk h zit het in de familie
9244825 nee ze lijken niet op elkaar het is ook geen familie van elkaar
9244826 ik kleed ze niet hetzelfde omdat ik dat niet betalen kan
9244827 druk hoezo druk ik heb geen reet te doen ik doe er ook niks mee hoor ze redden zichzelf maar
9244828 ben ik een vrouw vrouw en dan zo n die alleen maar zeiken kan
9244829 ik snap vrouwen vaak niet mannen zitten veel ongecompliceerder in elkaar bij een man is het gras groen of niet bij een vrouw is het niet groen maar ook niet niet om er vervolgens een half uur over uit te wijden waarom het niet groen of niet niet is ik word daar altijd zo moe van
9244830 daar waar al die andere vrouwen het altijd over hebben daar heb jij het nooit over wat die vrouwen waar jij het over hebt doen doe jij nooit
9244831 jij kijkt studio sport terwijl ik in de keuken sta te koken jij hebt de afstandsbediening ik nooit niet dat ik dat erg vind hoor ik doe de kinderen in bad en op bed terwijl jij het journaal kijkt en de boekhouding doet
9244832 dus als ik het goed begrijp ben ik een lui ego stisch manwijf en jij een mislukte man die slaafs de huishoudelijke verplichtingen vervult onder het juk van zijn mannelijke vrouw volgens mij zou je wel graag willen ruilen met al die vrienden van je die een vrouw hebben die voor ze wast zuigt dweilt de kinderen verzorgt etc zodat haar man zinloos naar een drijvende dobber kan loeren in n of ander triest slootje en maar zeuren en maar vreemdgaan omdat hun leven m t kinderen toch wel wat tegenvalt ten opzichte van vroeger z nder kinderen en hun vrouw valt helemaal zwaar tegen want ze hebben ineens wenkbrauwen als die van bert van ernie en die hangbuik die er eerst nog niet was en dat mooie lange haar wat eraf ging en de oninteressante verhalen die ze tegenwoordig ophangen over de ouderraad van het kleuterklasje ik pas daarvoor ik wil niet zo n man die vol overtuiging heeft meegewerkt aan het fabriceren van het kind om er vervolgens achter te komen dat het niet is wat hij gedacht had
9244833 waar komt dit nu weer vandaan dat heb ik helemaal niet gezegd ik hou van mijn kinderen ik ga helemaal niet vreemd ik zei alleen maar dat jij geen vrouw vrouw bent en je bent heus ook geen manwijf
9244834 het is ook nooit goed voor een man dan is zijn vrouw een persil trut maar als ze mee praat over voetbal moet ze haar plek weten dan is ze weer vrouw nou ik vind het wel goed ik blijf mezelf en geen man die dat veranderen kan
9244835 kind van ontaarde moeder verdwenen moeder in hechtenis maakt een zeer verwarde indruk
9244836 when russia has a grievance over an issue such as south ossetia it should act multilaterally by consent rather than unilaterally by force
9244837 my message to russia is simple if you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the g8 oecd and wto you must accept that with rights come responsibilities
9244838 we want russia to be a good partner in the g8 and other organisations but it cannot pick and choose which rules to adhere to
9244839 that is why i will argue tomorrow that russia should accept georgias territorial integrity and international mechanisms for addressing these conflicts and withdraw troops to their previous positions
9244840 and in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9244841 we are also reflecting on the nato response we must re evaluate the alliances relationship with russia and intensify our support to georgia and others who may face russian aggression
9244842 must add urgency to the work on europes energy agenda
9244843 we must more rapidly build relationships with other producers of oil and gas
9244844 there was a lot of opinions from all different sources
9244845 i know our staff and i know i didnt buy into it there was a process that started a long time ago a lot of information to be evaluated and it really wasnt one thing more than another to the credit of both of the quarterbacks it was close
9244846 and thats what you want to see i saw the competitiveness of matt come out and i have no doubts that when its his turn this year to play that hell respond in the same way
9244847 i know no matter which way we went with this decision somebody was going to be upset
9244848 he leinart is disappointed because he felt like he had made progress and he has made progress
9244849 but im also disappointed for matt and know the position hes in and how difficult that is
9244850 i knew it was going to have the whole preseason to play out
9244851 i knew there were a lot of things that were going to happen between when we started this process back in january and where we are right now
9244852 as you know i do have my own jet but ive been having to fly back and forth to la pursuing my acting career now if im flying back and forth twice a month thats like 200 000 250 00 round trip im back on american airlines
9244853 give a shout out to all my saudi arabia brothers and sisters and all the brothers and sisters in all the countries that have oil if you could please send me some oil for my jet i would truly appreciate it
9244854 tell whoever the next president is we need to bring gas prices down i cant believe im flying commercial
9244855 its something i dont think anyone has ever done before
9244856 have i ever had a reason for why i do what i do im having fun
9244857 the survey took it to mean all moslems are guilty for the acts of a few

9244944 yaitu bagi orang yang telah lanjut usia yang tidak ada harapan kesembuhan kembali kuat
9244945 ketika darah haidh keluar terdapat darah lain yang juga ikut keluar bagi wanita haidh dimungkinkan berpuasa di luar waktu waktu keluarnya darah haidh dan darah lain yang keluar pada masa haidh maka wanita yang berpuasa dalam keadaan tidak haidh atau tidak keluar darah lainnya bersama haidh adalah puasa yang adil karena tidak ada sesuatu darah pun yang merupakan kekuatan badan yang keluar dari tubuhnya apabila dia berpuasa di saat haidh maka hal ini akan menyebabkan tenaganya menjadi berkurang dan akan lemah oleh karena itu yang adil adalah meninggalkan puasa dan diperintahkan untuk berpuasa selain waktu waktu haidh
9244946 berbeda dengan haidh waktunya umum dan tidak menentu tidak mungkin menghindar dari hal hal seperti muntah keluar darah karena luka bisul mimpi basah dan lain sebagainya kejadian kejadian tersebut tidaklah menjadi penghalang untuk tidak berpuasa seperti halnya darah haidh

9244965 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

9244984 i was just sitting in my tent on the sleeping bag and packing my pack
9244985 it was like a ton of bricks coming in on me
9244986 when the bear started dragging me i started screaming for anne and the other ladies
9244987 they came running at the tent and the bear had its head in the tent
9244988 that got its attention and it left staples alone and came toward the other two women
9244989 the sound of the aerosol spray and the odor was enough for the bear to turn and amble slowly away
9244990 their quick thinking and their quick actions very likely saved her life
9244991 she basically faced the bear down and chased it off
9244992 after a lifetime traveling around the world for the state department with repeated assignments in africa the staples return home to retirement and face this thank heavens shes alive
9244993 i wanted to see the northern hemisphere while i could still walk into it
9244994 the way their camp was set up we cant see anything at all that would have possibly mitigated this

9244996 right now its a little early to talk about it or decipher everything
9244997 the resident canada goose population is stable to slightly increasing
9244998 we are in good shape our target goal is 50 000 resident geese and we are right at that number
9244999 all the guys i know that hunt them and do well hunt them on fields just like in winter

9245001 during this time of year the early morning and dusk are best they stay put during the day in this heat a pond with clover alfalfa or silage nearby is a great place to start they are looking for fresh cut greenery
9245002 make sure you dont take birds coming into ponds after legal shooting hours
9245003 we just kept plugging away and expected good things to happen and most of the time they eventually did
9245004 theres going to be things go wrong in the game and how our team responds will be critical
9245005 we know who looks like theyre the leaders but they need to do it when it really counts
9245006 sunday is when it really starts counting who knows wholl have to have the guts to make things happen in those situations thats why we play the game
9245007 even if hes the focus or not hes the leader of the offense
9245008 i think weve got firepower but whether it will perform as firepower in games is what we need to see
9245009 im tired of seeing us go against each other i want to see us go against somebody else
9245010 im looking as much forward to it as you probably are to see how they do
9245011 why i a clinton supporter will vote for john mccain
9245012 i heard on the news about the new deployments and while i support our president condoleezza rice and the administration i want to know that we have an exit plan in place i want assurances that we are doing all we can to keep our troops safe

9245014 the number of female alcoholics has risen from 65 000 to about 100 000 and the number of male alcoholics has risen from about 135 000 to about 165 000 one important reason is that it has become easier and cheaper to buy alcohol
9245015 during many sleepless nights i kept asking how is it that possible that we did this to each other
9245016 i have not found the answers but i know one thing if the truth cannot save us then really nothing can save us
9245017 the firefly populations have dropped 70 percent in the past three years
9245018 the only new but nonetheless absurd suggestion from the mdc was that cabinet be co chaired by president mugabe and mdc leader morgan tsvangirai zanu pf dismissed that not just as insolent but also stunning ignorance on how government works
9245019 if the law is passed by september 9 or 10 we can hold the elections on december 22 if its later than that we will try for december 31
9245020 deep wounds caused by italian colonisation to the people of libya
9245021 many americans are worried about the health of our housing and job markets i share these concerns about our economy yet there have been some recent signs that our economy is beginning to improve
9245022 during our convention we democrats laid out clear bold solutions to tackle the two biggest challenges confronting our nation economic disarray at home and a decline in american strength and support around the world
9245023 the contrasts between us and the republicans could not be starker especially on issues that matter to middle class families
9245024 above all the speech reflects on the role of the presidency and the qualities that are demanded by the job and makes the case that john mccain is the best qualified to be our next leader and commander in chief
9245025 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet
9245026 i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9245027 im going to google her to find out more it will draw some hillary voters who are on the fence
9245028 there has been no improvement in the ground situation so far hence the conditions are still not conducive for resuming work today
9245029 we want to focus on helping bridge the gap of u s vehicles traveling to the iss international space station as efficiently as possible
9245030 but ive made it clear to the science team that the warrantys over
9245031 armstrong says that positive thinking and doing a lot of sports can save you i dont agree
9245032 i even think its dangerous because it implies that if you are not a positive thinker all the time you lose the doctors saved me i am just lucky
9245033 ive helped hundreds get off drugs in scientology weve the only successful drug rehabilitation programme in the world its a statistically proven fact
9245034 and when the republican chieftains nodded solemnly and pityingly and said
9245035 she does herself a disservice to even mention it really youve got to plow through that youve got to know what youre getting into
9245036 any kind of perceived whine about that excess criticism i think man that doesnt do us any good women in politics women in general wanting to progress this country
9245037 lester questioned greens motherhood asking palin if the senator cares about her own kids palin laughs
9245038 governor you cant say this but i will lyda green is a cancer and a b
9245039 i would like that too very much but i respect you and i wont do it
9245040 eg brown skinned doll removed but angry mood wearing dresses princess
9245041 will women be swayed by palins appearance on the ticket
9245042 i tell you the truth as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers you did it to me
9245043 i got mine if you dont want to be mean enough to get yours at the expense of those less fortunate less powerful less greedy fuck you
9245044 we have working white families in the south voting for tax cuts for the richest 1 while their children remain with no health care
9245045 the dividing of working people by race has been a cornerstone of republican politics for the last three decades starting with richard nixon the only way were going to beat george bush is if southern white working families and african american working families come together under the democratic tent as they did under fdr
9245046 to think about how well cole threw the ball and how well our lineup did against ryan dempster
9245047 2008 is official george basketball 2008 torch athletic at official tar outlook
9245048 soon theyll be telling us that we cant thrash our own wives
9245049 we cannot go to our constituencies for fear of being killed the provincial minister for science and technology said
9245050 but at least in the short term it will shake up the race and leave some asking why senator obama didnt pick senator clinton to be his veep
9245051 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9245052 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9245053 without hillary being the nominee its really quite equally as important
9245054 there are a lot of women who are disaffected by how hillary was treated by the media by how she was treated by the obama campaign not speaking up when sexism raised its ugly head in the media
9245055 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9245056 and it is warm not something im really used to
9245057 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9245058 can be a distraction in these kinds of situations so we want to make sure that were monitoring the situation and that were being useful
9245059 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case for me
9245060 users did not want search engines to stores any data at all

9245062 we want to stop the swift boating before it gets off the ground
9245063 theyre not going to be intimidated by some pipsqueak on the kooky left
9245064 wouldnt you rather click on one link and receive a concise summary a digest on the phenomenon of for example the dot com bubble compiled from the top most relevant pages on the subject
9245065 it would be unrealistic to expect sensbot to match a summary prepared by a human expert however we believe that even less than perfect summaries may be of great help for internet users and would be preferable to numerous links to web pages
9245066 we also anticipate that the advent of semantic web and tools like yahoo mindset will allow sensebot to get a more accurate identification of the type of web pages thus decreasing the amount of noise in the content and improving the quality of generated summaries we are open to partnerships in any of these areas

9245076 todos los partidos son complicados uno los hace complicados o menos complicados como se va desenvolviendo en el campo tuvimos oportunidades claras el equipo estuvo bien y en la nica llegada que tuvieron ellos la hicieron v lida
9245077 no est conforme con el resultado la circunstancias estaban para haber ganado yo s que la lluvia y las expulsiones pintaban para que le di ramos la vuelta al marcador y creo que lo est bamos haciendo bien pero esto no es de merecer sino de hacer
9245078 el funcionamiento me gusta pero hay unos detallitos que hay que corregir el equipo siempre estuvo insistiendo teniendo posici n de pelota manteniendo las circunstancias adecuadas para encontrar el arco rival en el segundo tiempo las circunstancias fueron muy diferentes con la lluvia
9245079 creo que el equipo cada vez se ve mejor en el primer tiempo mostr un futbol vertical con jugadas de uno o dos toques que realmente cada vez me entusiasma m s
9245080 zeballos cada vez se ve mejor pero la mayor a ya ha estado y han tenido continuidad y por consecuencia viene lo mejor de ellos y saben que pueden dar mucho m s y as debe de ser realmente cualquiera puede jugar hay una competencia sana y nadie se debe echar a dormir porque en cualquier momento pueden jugar est n mostrando el futbol que deseo y me deja contento el funcionamiento ya que fuimos los mejores sin embargo hay que seguir trabajando en la definici n

9245221 in this information era the use of research based information is vital in continuously improving the educational practices and creating forward looking policies
9245222 i was born and brought up in wales and trained as a primary elementary schoolteacher i taught other peoples children for over 12 years until i took early retirement on health grounds when i was diagnosed with terminal neuroendocrine cancer my son was then only 18 months old at that point i was too poorly to even think of homeschooling so school was the only option thank the lord i am now much better and strong enough to provide littlesmurf with an apt and adequate education
9245223 well my husband gets home at 6pm and my husband and all 5 of my kids go to bed at 9pm
9245224 we know something you dont know ha ha ha ha ha ha
9245225 huh i could have sworn that i fucked up their car oh thats right the car is under warranty and the van isnt i decided to let them off the hook with the car and fuck with the van
9245226 moms formed three years ago at princeton and now live in brooklyn they play orchestral space pop combining the epic scale of post rock with a pop sensibility using mandolin and strings as the driving force behind the music their most frequent comparisons include broken social scene if they were pared down to a 6 piece they added a cellist
9245227 ong bak 2 which was to have been his directorial debut his subsequent return and on air clash with the films producers
9245228 ong bak 2 is still a movie worth waiting for
9245229 przemyslaw kazmierczak 7 kept the ball moving well and was inches away from opening his account on two occasions only for the ball to fly narrowly wide once and steele to make an outstanding save the second time his best performance in a derby shirt so far
9245230 my booklist was a short list with thin books to be honest but that was more because i didnt have the time i love reading i like reading all sorts of books its great to wind down and you learn a lot too
9245231 i try to think along with my club i watch a lot of football like the copa libertadores i saw two players who could really do well at ajax and i tipped van basten i did that at heerenveen as well one player was guerron a guy with a superb cross but he was signed for getafe so i can name his name now the other player i wont mention now
9245232 frustrated nah it doesnt feel like that at all youll get frustrated when youre close to a deal and then it doesnt happen you know there were some contacts but i only want to leave ajax for an absolute top club nothing less and yes real madrid that would be one of them anyone would want to play for madrid but im not doing one of those inbetween steps to a sub top european team why would i
9245233 i do notice of course that against russia or similar opponents its harder than against say fc utrecht but a move to some other competition isnt sacred i played against sunderland and newcastle united with ajax and heerenveen but i wasnt too impressed with their level its not arsenal chelsea in the epl every week you know
9245234 i know myself im very ambitious i wouldnt want to play for a mid tier team in spain or england and i have to play in or around the box i love the sport too much to go for a bigger club make more money but not win prizes or play great football i want the peaks and the troughs and i can have that with ajaz the top of holland
9245235 one goal per match should be feasible but i would be happy to score less as long as we win the title
9245236 and why not i also want to score in den haag and in volendam those are the only two stadiums in the eredivisie i never scored
9245237 we signed some exciting players but thats not it we need to be able to gel these players into the team
9245238 i came in the winter from heerenveen ajax wasnt doing too good lots of criticism danny blind was manager and there was a lot of debate on his future with the club we managed somehow to pull together and we did so well in the second half of the competition we won basically everything and came from a desperate position to the play offs winning the cl qualification ticket and the national cup
9245239 i love working on something big and i will take responsibility if people dont abide by the rules it can annoy me shitless and i will open my mouth i dont like powerplay though and i wont abuse my position i dont think you should talk too much in football you have to show it on the pitch
9245240 he is a great human being cery correct in his interactions and very involved with other players paul bosvelt at heerenveen was similar they were born captains
9245241 i think gabri and oleguer with their experience will be able to lead stekelenburg has it too and rasmus lindgren
9245242 i will never get used to that suddenly strangers start filming me on their mobile phones what is that that famous people game is nothing for me
9245243 klaas jan is a sweet funny and sharp kid he hasnt changed although he has a sort of tough layer of varnish over that personality dennis had that as well
9245244 i wont avoid public places like the cinema but i dont enjoy the attention i do like to visit the sports fishing show every year visma i like to meet people from all walks of life i recently spoke to an entrepreneur i love that someone who built a company from the ground up i like to read about that too the visma is always in rotterdam and its fun to get all those remarks from sports fishers from rotterdam
9245245 i havent won any real prizes with ajax psv has been stronger but its more their consistency than anything else they dont play very attractive or score a lot of goals but they know how to stop you from scoring psv is still the title favorite i guess they play some sort of counter football they allow the opponent to make the play and when you lose possession they quickly overturn you thats a great weapon and all but it is absolutely easier to play like that than the way ajax wants to play we play possession football and when we lose the ball we immediately have to go 30 meters back in full sprint takes more energy
9245246 a gente n o quer s comida a gente quer comida divers o e arte
9245247 he is great but they need to invent a new position for him
9245248 i am positively surprised with the enormous potential of this group theres a lot of very good young players but were basically a long way from the level that were looking for
9245249 its fun i am working with players on a daily basis again and that feels great and i have a central position in the club organization and i am constantly working on different aspects
9245250 we train twice a day in this phase and in between theres numerous other stuff to do organisational and the like its very busy and the task is grand theres a lot of things that i have to have an opinion about so im still a bit searching and looking around and getting used to stuff people come to me with questions and all i will need to get some structure going
9245251 people always mock the dutch knvb football federation but thats not fair i have worked their with a lot of satisfaction for four years the organization is very good the facilities and infrastructure is there and they have a number of topnotch people working for them but working at ajax is more fun for me because i have the players every day so my impact is bigger now
9245252 players need to play together a lot to form a team we have that team process as well in terms of management and decision making thats why i like a lot of communication and meeting i may be the one to call the shots but after ample consideration im happy with where we are but i can see more room for improvement id like to see a separate and new trainings facility we need to keep on dreaming on that
9245253 i assume you mean the last friendly laughs i liked it i enjoyed myself i think oranje played very well both in defense and offense they could and maybe should have won that game but it was good to have seen so many opportunities a good start
9245254 were in for a rough road over the next couple of quarters
9245255 i dont think at this point there is a whole lot we can do about it
9245256 the house will soon act on additional broad based economic recovery and energy plans that will create new american jobs make energy more affordable independent and green and mark an essential shift from the failed bush policies republicans in congress have rubber stamped for far too long
9245257 i think they are making our job easier for us
9245258 its clear to the american people what the distinctions are a pro working family agenda offered by the democrats or the status quo
9245259 i think if you see the chances we created it was a deserved win

9245262 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

9245272 generic intellectual abilities and a broad understanding of the world
9245273 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
9245274 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
9245275 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
9245276 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
9245277 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
9245278 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
9245279 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
9245280 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
9245281 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
9245282 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
9245283 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
9245284 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce

9245288 aside from hopefully providing a platform for some of the creators to be read by a wider audience i thought just having a collection of stories might be one step in the long road of creating a comics community here in south east asia
9245289 liquid city was an attempt to create some sort of joint enterprise that comics creators in the region could all participate in the theme of cities provides some grounding but is also loose enough to allow the creators to pursue their own agendas

9245291 we needed to put up some runs weve got the offensive power to do it and we showed it tonight
9245292 i thought it could be better and it was i had command of all my pitches
9245293 if i had made one movewe might have won the game
9245294 i went out to question it third base umpire tom hallion said he was positive it was foul but would check with the home plate umpire
9245295 we are pleased about our roster heading into the 2008 season
9245296 im satisfied with the process we went through to get to this point including minicamp training camp and the preseason our coaching staff did a good job guiding our players over the past five months and im very proud of the team our staff put together im looking forward to starting the regular season
9245297 you have to keep your best 53 players this gives us great depth along the defensive front we believe there was too much of a risk to consider releasing some of the young linemen
9245298 there was some tough calls some of the receivers did a nice job for us a couple of those blockers are pretty solid guys
9245299 coachs in for krvn l a huskers sports item a aug kareenas a is spacer kfab husker football radio
9245300 baby do you think maybe your friend would be interested in
9245301 ultimately you have to keep your best 53 players this gives us great depth along the defensive front we believe there was too much of a risk to consider releasing some of the young linemen
9245302 so many receivers did a nice job for us and a couple of blockers were real solid guys
9245303 they want that shot to get in the ring they get in the ring and we cut them all down we kill them all and let god sort them out
9245304 youre going to make some mistakes but were going to go full speed right from the first whistle to the last whistle every man every play
9245305 you deserve that to go every man every play from the first whistle to the last whistle go fly around like hell theyll make some plays well make some plays well make one more than them and sing the victors afterward
9245306 people are saying geez he should be in the rotation but its not good to go that far at this point
9245307 hes a four pitch pitcher now zach was basically a two pitch pitcher out of the bullpen he got some confidence now and good concentration he knows how to handle and execute the game plan now
9245308 the least experienced least credentialed person to join a major party ticket in the modern era
9245309 they didnt look flustered did we miss a read or two im sure we did i thought they managed the game ok i think they did a pretty good job for their first time out there
9245310 thats what he thought was best for the team so im all for it i accept my role and do my best to help michigan win
9245311 we love louie to death but weve got find a way to get into the end zone
9245312 since ive been here this has been one of the biggest victories for sure but youll have to look back in the last 15 years to see where it ranks it was a great way to start the season the last couple of years we have not started the year well with losses on the road to ucla and oregon state so its a great way to get started
9245313 you try to draw the defense off sides we just dont move
9245314 its tough frustrating to start the year again like this theres nothing we can do about it now
9245315 i think its a great event for the whole michigan football family
9245316 bring the family together and show there is a new set of family values in place in the program
9245317 i see these guys with their game faces on ready to go
9245318 we miss lloyd carr but its good to start a new era with a new tradition
9245319 i thought our players got excited about it i thought the fans were terrific they came out in numbers and were very supportive unfortunately we didnt make enough exciting things happen to get the crowd into it more
9245320 we have had a relationship with quinton for a while now so that made this arrangement possible
9245321 we became friends when he came over for a seminar which never happened and he ended up staying at my house
9245322 for ufc 75 in london quinton came over with cheick kongo and we ran a training camp at the lair it is here where he struck up a very good rapport with our striking coaches tony quigley our boxing coach and dave jackson our muay thai coach
9245323 quinton has become very friendly with many of our guys
9245324 obviously he already was good friends with michael bisping but he has really came to like and respect the younger members of our team such as paul kelly and tom blackledge
9245325 for fights in america we will simply run camps at big bear calif
9245326 so nothing much will change in that regard he will train with mostly the same group of guys except we will oversee the training instead of former trainer juanito ibarra
9245327 however if quinton is headlining one of the u k cards he will train at our wolfslair gym and do his whole camp in england so there is no problem whatsoever with quintons training schedule
9245328 our experience with michael bisping will help us a lot
9245329 we have built up a good relationship with the ufc ever since michael was on the ultimate fighter 3
9245330 we also have the ability to get big sponsorship deals for our guys we are more than capable of handling the business side of quintons career
9245331 december looks most likely to be the date for his return
9245332 it is not hard to work out who is possible opponents the problem is with the 205 pound class many of the top fighters are all ready booked for fights or are injured
9245333 i think it is certain to be either mauricio shogun rua or wanderlei silva
9245334 yeah i had a note on it i threw it away
9245335 a manager cannot request that the umpires look at a replay
9245336 you can talk to an umpire which he did on the polanco play and tell him to ask for help if theres indecisiveness when he gets help they can go look at it
9245337 you cant ask them to its not like throwing a red flag in football
9245338 hes a guy you dont fear facing but with the numbers hes put up against us this year i guess we should
9245339 he doesnt throw overly hard he doesnt have really great stuff
9245340 maybe its a confidence thing he has against us hes a guy we need to get to we didnt do it
9245341 what did i see nothing a lot of not executing
9245342 a lot of things we expected we hoped it didnt happened just a lack of execution guys were kind of tentative at the beginning and its frustrating we kept trying to push them along push them along they started to at the end of the game but too late
9245343 not encouraged by a whole lot to be honest the biggest thing is they fought they kept hanging in there you take that and run with it
9245344 we didnt give the defense much chance to rest because we couldnt establish any long drives because we werent running the ball effectively theres a lot of precision involved in any offense and we didnt have any
9245345 our offense never really got in any rhythm which was disappointing
9245346 i thought they controlled the game in the first half with their passing game
9245347 it was intense 110 000 in the stadium what more could you ask for it was the biggest stage in the world for us it was great to get a victory it was a tough one but it was a good one
9245348 maybe coming out in the second half guys knew what was at stake
9245349 we came into the first half a little slow i know in the second half i saw a spark i saw something in our whole team we were resilient we didnt give up until the end we didnt come out on top at the end but we learned something in the process
9245350 the gift you received today is a token of elitexcs appreciation to all press and a reminder about how we do treat our fighters
9245351 and any fan that also wants to see exactly how we treat them right should go to any major retailer of dvds and buy elitexc renegades
9245352 and if im wrong about what i claim send me your receipt and ill pay for it
9245353 i plan on releasing a statement about karl noons jr
9245354 it just wont be happening over this weekend karl is an employee of elitexc and this is labor day so i figured id give him a weekend off of public embarrassment
9245355 honor my contract elite xc wants to talk about honoring the contract how about when elite xc honored the contract and my pay to fight edson berto went down after i lost my first fight that was not part of my contract or how about the contract gary shaw breached by not promoting my boxing career gary shaw only gave me one out of four of the agreed upon fights i have not boxed for over a year when i signed with elite xc i was promised they would promote both my boxing and mma careers i could have signed with another mma only company but i wanted to box too
9245356 elite xc does me a favor after i lose by putting me on the first shoxc against edson berto
9245357 elite xc does me a favor after i lose by putting me on the first shoxc against edson berto bertos father is good friends with jareds father gary shaw who wants bertos brother on a boxing contract berto was the next guy elite xc wanted to build but i win that fight and now i am 1 1 elite xc gives me an opportunity to fight diaz elite xc puts me against diaz because elite xcs roster was so light and there was nobody else to fight him elite xc creates a new weight class for diaz because he beat gomi giving diaz a belt and creating a weight division 160 he can make will make your belt legit sorry to ruin elite xcs plans and beat him elite xc never promoted or took care of me as their champion
9245358 in the elite xcs dvd where diaz and i fought there are two 2 baseball cards of diaz and kimbo hello i won the fight and elite xcs promoting diaz after i beat him or how about the day elite xc flew diaz in to do a signing on the dvd where he lost wow that must have been uncomfortable nick signing a dvd and it is a fight that you lost why wasnt i flown in for the signing elite xc has never promoted me on either of their websites elitexc or pro elite elite xc offered me a fight on the first cbs show but only if i signed a new long term contract instead of promoting their best fighters on cbs you have to be on a long term contract for them to promote you that was not our deal
9245359 consider when elite xc gives a couple thousand tickets away at their cbs show in stockton elite xc gives me a hard time about comping me one extra ticket for my cousin that helped me train for my fight i only get four tickets per show i am the main event in honolulu my home town i did not ask for any tickets for my family and friends and they gave me a hard time about one extra ticket or how about when elite xc brought diaz into the ring after my last victory in hawaii to disrespect me and my family
9245360 chuck champion president elite xc threatens me my family and my manager with lawsuits and how hes going to sue me haha pretty hard to sue a guy who does not make jack with your company im glad kala disclosed how much i make which breached the confidentiality clause of the contract i will break down the real numbers for you i am the defending world champ i have been the main event for elite xc three out of four times on showtime in almost two years i have made approximately 83 000 after paying my trainers and managers fee i have 50 000 thousand after taxes probably 30 grand divide that by two years for 15 000 thousand a year divide by 52 weeks that amounts to approximately 300 a week i do not know anybody that can survive on that amount of money my buddies make more money than that in a couple days being a bus boy or bar back and yes you can argue i should fight more elite xc doesnt give me fights or promote me they ice me gary shaw productions only gave me one of the agreed upon four fights per the boxing contract and i do not want to ramble on about all the little small stuff that i can keep going on about but the straw that broke the camels back is they want me to fight diaz for the second time diaz is not the number one contender and they are paying diaz three times more money than me diaz complained after the stockton fight he was not paid enough how do you think that made me feel yes you can argue that diaz gets more for the draw therefore i do not deserve as much compensation if that is the case it is a result of elite xc terrible job promoting me instead of promoting me as their champ and upcoming athlete elite xc has resented me for ruining their plans to make diaz their champ that is just total disrespect so it comes down to money and what is fair i am tired of being bent over by elite xc with no vaseline
9245361 i am right when i say diaz is not the number one contender elite xc is trying to force this fight for their ratings eddie alaverez is the number one contender and anybody with half a brain knows that a fight with eddie is a way harder fight for me than diaz i will fight diaz but elite has to be fair im not ducking diaz why the hell would i be scared of someone i already beat with that being said i am going to focus on my boxing career i can make more money doing 6 and 8 rounders every other month and make more than i did being the elite xc defending world champ at least i will be able to sleep at night and be able to look myself in the mirror everyday that right there is worth more than 300 bucks a week or fighting a guy i cannot stand for less money than him the second time around will the diaz fight happen yes will the fight happen on elite xc on october 4 2008 probably not the way things are being run by chuck champion a guy whose history is newspapers not fighting and kala someone who talks a lot of game but has never put on a pair of gloves never stepped in a ring or cage kala has had everything handed to him with a silver spoon from daddy does anyone else but me think kala just wants to be famous and stir up all this dirty laundry i guess any publicity is good publicity when i think about it it has been good promotion for their october card since nobody is talking about it until you bring up the noons vs diaz match up
9245362 300 a week i do not know anybody that can survive on that amount of money

9245370 i think the company did a very effective job of glossing over these questions in its marketing campaign and convincing the public that this vaccine would indeed prevent cervical cancer said
9245371 top medical breakthrough of 2006 has to be the cancer vaccine for cervical cancer gardasil
9245372 the hullabaloo began in june when the fda approved gardasil a vaccine widely described as 100 percent effective in preventing cervical cancer a disease that kills some 233 000 women worldwide each year
9245373 its worth asking a few questions why does the vaccine cost 360 for a three shot regimen how much do we know about the new product and is this a cost effective use of health care dollars
9245374 only two strains of hpv human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer and those two account for just 70 percent of all cases the vaccine has no effect on the viral strains which account for the other 30 percent
9245375 we dont know yet whats going to happen when millions of doses of the vaccine have been given and to put in place a process that says you must have this vaccine it means you must be part of a big public experiment
9245376 the upa chairperson and the prime minister requested the sp to join the union government but the sp politely refused the offer because of its deep and serious engagements in strengthening the samajwadi party in uttar pradesh they thanked both the leaders for the kind offer
9245377 the sp reiterated their strong commitment to work with and fully support the upa government
9245378 the chief minister has not applied for the us visa recently the recent campaign in the us against him is the handiwork of forces opposed to the state

9245394 when cnn political correspondent dana bash interviewed mccain last april she mentioned his joke that one of the two main tasks of the vice president is to check on the presidents health every day a job of particular importance in his case

9245396 presidential scholars say she appears to be the least experienced least credentialed person to join a major party ticket in the modern era

9245398 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9245399 oh to be fair hillary may well be intellectually smarter but i think palin is more ethical and practical pragmatic
9245400 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
9245401 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
9245402 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
9245403 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president

9245405 de uitslag is correct want we waren niet bij machte om de match helemaal lam te leggen
9245406 ik ben niet dolblij want dat ben ik als we winnen en goed spelen
9245407 na de 2 0 wilden we het te moeilijk doen
9245408 na de 2 1 zijn mijn spelers zelfs bang geworden dat betekent dat we nog werk hebben lyon gaat beter om met zon situaties

9245418 bovendien vind ik astana een aantrekkelijke ploeg met veel toekomst
9245419 ik kon vorig jaar ook al naar astana gaan met johan
9245420 maar toen was er te veel mist rond de ploeg en er was de taalbarri re nu ben ik er wel klaar voor
9245421 wat het verschil is tussen bruyneel en patrick lefevere ze kennen allebei hun stiel maar die acht jaar met johan bij discovery zijn toch blijven hangen
9245422 ik denk dat ik het best functioneer onder de vleugels van johan
9245423 the recent widespread shortage of silver for retail purchase coupled with a price collapse appears to have shaken these analysts confidence that the comex silver market is operating fair and square well it should since there is no rational explanation for a significant price decline going hand in hand with product shortages other than collusive manipulation

9245479 durch nichts kann die gr e des erfolges der sozialistischen ideen besser beleuchtet werden als gerade durch die feststellung der tatsache da man sich daran gew hnt hat nur jene politik die auf die sofortige und vollst ndige durchf hrung des sozialistischen programms hinzielt als sozialistisch zu bezeichnen und allen jenen richtungen die mit mehr ma und zur ckhaltung zu demselben ziele hinstreben oder den sozialismus nur mit gewissen einschr nkungen verwirklichen wollen diese benennung verweigert ja sie selbst als gegner des sozialismus bezeichnet dieser sprachgebrauch konnte sich nur einb rgern weil es wahre gegner des sozialismus kaum noch gibt

9245496 we found ourselves in an awkward situation when a country militarily invading and occupying our country then recognizing part of its territories is trying to create a sense of normalcy

9245500 it was a brave a decision to play the same side that played so dismally at manchester city last week
9245501 but as i said right at the start of the game it shows his faith
9245502 the players will say hes given us the chance to try and put things right and they certainly did do that
9245503 it wasnt a 4 1 game and probably 2 1 would have been justified because they scored two late goals but they played very well
9245504 noble and parker played in the middle of the park and they dominated things and it was a very good game of football
9245505 just when it was 2 1 in the first half derbyshire came on for santa cruz and his goal should have stood
9245506 ive seen it again and he wasnt offside because he was in line with the defender and the linesman got it completely wrong that might have changed the whole complexion of the game
9245507 he ince may have felt that he should have got something out of it
9245508 robert green made the penalty save but he made two other saves as well
9245509 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to cease all zoom operations it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
9245510 than our recent battles with all the horsemen of the apocalypse combined
9245511 while people concentrate on the big holiday airlines and national carriers the companies that are going to have real problems in the coming winter are the smaller airlines such as eastern airways and loganair who operate older less fuel efficient and smaller aircraft
9245512 rising fuel prices have actually brought them to their knees an airline such as zoom does operate on fairly tight margins and the business is seasonal in contrast to cargo and business travel
9245513 the timing was bad no sooner had brokers been approached then the oil price started to move and the market began to get jittery a flotation in this environment just wasnt a possibility
9245514 we have to be realistic the airlines planes are grounded with no immediate prospect of them flying again
9245515 but we will continue and do our best to examine every possible option
9245516 i would just like to reassure passengers that everything possible was done on thursday to keep our aircraft in the air but it proved ultimately impossible as the reaction to our position became even more intense
9245517 we certainly believed up until the last couple of hours that we could continue operations within the status of creditor protection which the airline industry on both sides of the atlantic has done on a regular basis the domino effect of one aircraft impounded in canada set in train a series of events that were absolutely unstoppable
9245518 it is going to get a lot more complicated for passengers
9245519 what we will see is the emergence of both lower and higher cost airlines american airlines have already started to charge people to put baggage in their hold while united is going to start charging economy class passengers for meals on a trial basis between london and washington
9245520 the cost of air travel will have to rise and it will not just be start ups and smaller carriers failing we are going to see a few of the big traditional airlines suffering
9245521 i like living here i enjoy the people and the company it has not killed me yet
9245522 you will notice my script isnt quite the same as the one you were taught you will also notice it changes with different people i mean you think you might get away with talking bollocks to one but not talking bollocks to another
9245523 remember the gas board we are the new gas board and thats why we are cheaper weve always been 12 cheaper than anybody because they have got to buy off us
9245524 scottish hydro are your supply company we supply you your billing company buy off us make a slight profit and sell it to yourself i can probably save you a house this size 14 to 22 a month
9245525 in 1996 scottish hydro took over the supply to this address every company buys off us sounds feasible doesnt it its a pile of bullshit we own 49 of scotia gas networks which operates two of britains gas distribution networks but i tell them we own it
9245526 i went through it all at the door and i actually had to stand and think how much of that is actually bollocks i mean there was a wee bit of f truth in there i dont use any of the script at all
9245527 hi we are the gas and electric do you know you are entitled to reductions on your energy tariffs
9245528 you are entitled to come off scottish gas and go direct you are cutting out the middle man
9245529 i really only like dealing with my local man and dont want to change i want to think about it if you give me some literature
9245530 i felt sick because i had been signing people up telling them we have had this honesty policy that we when we put our prices up it will be last and by the least amount we werent our company has been making me lie to all these people
9245531 i was feeling quite flustered i had my grandchildren over and i didnt want to be talking to these salesmen but they kept going on and on
9245532 i told them i couldnt see but the chap showed me the form and i signed i couldnt see what i was signing i just wanted them to go
9245533 one asked me what i paid i told him i paid 82 per month for gas and electricity he just turned over a page in his pad and said it would cost 55 with them i didnt believe him the way he came up with the figure didnt seem right
9245534 they seemed quite convincing they told me their company cut out the middle man
9245535 the first thing they said was that they were going to turn the gas off they didnt get very far with me i chased them off
9245536 because of the conditions of this cancellation the festival has taken the decision to start legal proceedings

9245539 i must admit that by my own measurement this would be an exaggeration the economy appears to be surviving rather better than he suggests i was surprised by his language
9245540 this hardly gives activists a morale boost we are out on the doorstep trying to reassure people at the same time as darling is telling them we are all doomed
9245541 who is telling the truth at the top of government its not clear whether alistair darling meant to tell us the truth about the mess that 10 years of labour have left our economy in but he has certainly let the cat out of the bag
9245542 where can we get money from now that banks have stopped lending
9245543 there are times when i wonder what all this knowledge about the fashion world is good for how does it tie into my psychology degree or plans to be a social worker worse there are the times when i feel tempted to add up all of the dollars and pennies that ive spent on fashion mags in my lifetime i may only be 22 but i know the total is grotesque and yet fashion is my passion ive tried to deny it and yet i get itchy palms and a racing heart every time that i see a new copy of lucky or get near a well designed frock and now with the rise of fashion blogs i find myself drawn in even further
9245544 the industry can no longer be contained to two arenas high fashion and commercial it has evolved into thousands of enclaves
9245545 i really dont care what league youre talking about hes one of the best quarterbacks in the country
9245546 im not aware of anybody thats ever promoted a guy this way

9245548 an asset stripping exercise directed as enabling him to carry on its business through another company with a similar name
9245549 the administrators were attempting to negotiate with someone mr foster who they knew to be bereft of the basics of commercial morality he was not to be trusted

9245554 theres a lot of mediocrity that people settle for in this country in terms of county cricket and the comfort zones of international cricket im not one for settling for mediocrity
9245555 i want to get better and better and better and do so much better every single time i practise then you can just entertain when you come out here because you can back yourself knowing you have done the hard yards before
9245556 there are a lot of people in this country and in this team who have got it freddie has certainly got it steve harmison has it so do michael vaughan and paul collingwood
9245557 there are a lot of guys who are there and thereabouts and thats my challenge to get the best out of them the bells the shahs the boparas the wrights the andersons the broads delivering day in day out
9245558 dont take five wickets one day and not deliver the next day but just keep going and going thats the only way to be happy as a person surely
9245559 our goals now are to get the best out of the players
9245560 to make sure the players dont talk about their talent but deliver their talent on a cricket field deliver it in a gym at practice and deliver their talent to each other they need to be honest with each other being able to talk like men to each other not behaving like kids to be all grown up men to just deliver and do what they should be doing

9245594 i was very bold about what needed to be done
9245595 i went through a lot with the press with the legislative body and it was rough with a staff who didnt want to be there working with a new boss
9245596 i learned youve got to be very discerning early on and decide if you can win them over or not if you cant you replace them early on

9245620 now no new prince has at any time disarmed his subjects rather when he has found them unarmed he has always given them arms this is because by arming your subjects you arm yourself those who were suspect become loyal and those who were loyal not only remain so but are changed from being merely your subjects to being your partisans some unsavory stuff here it is machiavelli after all but as soon as you disarm your subjects you start to offend them showing whether through cowardice or suspicion that you mistrust them and on either score hatred is aroused against you

9245623 mi aspettavo una partita cos difficile anche se praticamente abbiamo giocato senza difensori precisa il tecnico portoghese il pareggio stata la conseguenza logica di quello che si visto in campo noi abbiamo giocato un buon primo tempo mentre nella ripresa sono andati meglio loro come avevo detto prima di questo match il campionato una lunga maratona e di questo pareggio conquistato su un campo difficile non ne faccio un dramma
9245624 abbiamo disputato una grande partita a tratti siamo anche riusciti a mettere sotto una grande squadra come linter anche dopo aver preso il gol non ci siamo demoralizzati e negli spogliatoi siamo riusciti ad aggiustare quello che non andava se cera una squadra che meritava di vincere quella era senzaltro la sampdoria

9245693 i think we have the ability to do it i want to win an mvc title and win a super bowl but we have to win the mvc first and take it game by game
9245694 with all that new responsibility as quarterback and helping my family more and more leadership came to me
9245695 it came into play during football and i think it helped the team
9245696 theres finally a big strong arm in the program that can throw the ball short and long with accuracy which we didnt really have two years ago
9245697 but grimard is also versatile with a nose for running the football last year his arm was close to where he is now but now he can do that and then he can just run you over
9245698 im not the shiftiest of people but i like it
9245699 i feel that its an asset that helps the team because it gains extra yards and gives energy throughout the team
9245700 they see a spread team and they expect pass and then we run the ball effectively its too many threats
9245701 this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day that im not sure weve seen anything like it
9245702 if you decide to stay you are on your own
9245703 it will be miserable if we stay no water no power
9245704 but whether it is a category 4 or 5 it is extremely dangerous either way
9245705 flooding that is worse than what we saw with katrina
9245706 this storm could be as bad as it gets when it comes to the effect on the louisiana coast
9245707 they dont want to leave without their dogs i cant blame them i wouldnt leave without mine
9245708 we know this is a very difficult decision emotions are very high but we have to take a practical approach to this
9245709 during katrina not one thing was organised it was a state of panic and havoc
9245710 i wasnt going to let one of the little guys take me down
9245711 this signals the return of competition in the banking sector
9245712 the banks have been slowly increasing their profit margins but this will bring them back in line
9245713 some believe that labour should start within 24 hours or the risk of infection outweighs the risks of induction of labour i dont think that strikes me as even remotely wrong
9245714 shes not out to judge anyone and has good friends who are gay but that she supported the 1998 constitutional amendment
9245715 i believe that honoring the family structure is that important
9245716 it is people with your view point who are racist that support planned parenthood and their holocaust of black america where black woman make 6 of the population and comprise 40 of all abortions
9245717 choice of palin promises failed energy policies of the past
9245718 at the present time there is insufficient evidence to institute proceedings against dr haneef for any criminal offence
9245719 finally the afp have decided to tell the world what weve been saying since we got involved in the matter
9245720 but i think it would be early days yet and we should wait until the clarke inquiry concludes before we go down that path
9245721 its difficult to know why it took so long it shouldnt have and i believe that it was just mainly the afp playing games with mohameds freedom
9245722 it was a very complicated issue and afp police commissioner mick keelty decided that he would deal with it in that fashion
9245723 im not an expert in that area so its a bit out of my league to try and give ranges or estimates of what it could be
9245724 because it means now that if he ever has the plans to come back those plans can be looked at a little more seriously
9245725 but its unlikely that hell come back in the immediate future but it may happen later
9245726 le but de cette manifestation est dattirer lattention de lue sur le danger et sur labsence de perspectives que pr sente la mont e de la tension dans les relations avec la russie et dexprimer la volont de la diaspora russe de jouer un r le plus actif dans l tablissement du partenariat russie ue
9245727 nous ne savons pas combien de temps a va durer il faut donc faire des provisions quand tu as v cu des centaines douragans tu sais quoi acheter
9245728 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
9245729 i found that to tell the truth is the hardest thing on earth harder than fighting in a war harder than taking part in a revolution
9245730 its nice it gives you a feeling of security so that if something breaks we know we can always call a guy over and hell bring a drill or something
9245731 ill tell you one thing what i didnt know is how good our defense is over here
9245732 look at a guy like mike lowell hes so good over there you expect him to make every play i think thats the way our whole defense has gotten
9245733 but as for that vp talk all the time ill tell ya i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day
9245734 as anyone who truly understands technology will tell you our field evolves at a whirlwind pace what was once the latest and greatest is old news within a matter of a few short years and in some cases months it professionals must constantly re invent themselves in order to stay current in their field
9245735 e come se stessi salendo in corsa su un aereo senza benzina
9245736 i helped plan three different weddings my own and two of my daughters i remember how much fun that i had favors are just fun
9245737 i wanted to get into something beneficial i wanted to help the bride and make her job easier
9245738 my daughters were hands on d i y do it yourself we did a lot of our own wedding preparations including floral arrangements bouquets and the wedding favors
9245739 but it turns out we couldve gotten better quality favors for a lot less time and money online you need to know which areas will save you a lot of money by doing it yourself and when its actually less expensive to purchase online
9245740 my plan is to focus on selling the highest quality favors at the lowest price
9245741 when brides plan weddings they need a good informational source what works what doesnt work everybody is budget conscious i want it to be a resource for brides
9245742 were a specialty store for favors and our items are simple and elegant we have the lowest prices on the internet and the highest quality favors
9245743 he was one of the nicest most down to earth guys i have ever met
9245744 okee i went along with this whole dress up thing now wheres my blueberry
9245745 my inspiration was a matter of necessity and also a passion for my creativity
9245746 i love to sew therefore we have the grocery bags
9245747 i have given her soaps as gifts to my co workers
9245748 in fact many of my friends have requested her soap as gifts
9245749 ill be adding more soap formulations dishwasher detergent and hopefully some quilted pieces and some purses
9245750 ill be discussing soap making natural body products and environmentally friendly products ill also be writing about supporting your local economy and agriculture
9245751 this site and the soaps are an endless outlet for my creativity and my passion
9245752 and i like having the opportunity to share that with people
9245753 i really love jewelry and i have a passion for it
9245754 i decided to create an opportunity to share the sparkle and elegance of jewelry with people
9245755 i really love jewelry and i have a passion for it
9245756 i decided to create an opportunity to share the sparkle and elegance of jewelry with people
9245757 im really excited about being a part of the jewelry trade excited about having the opportunity to get to know more about jewelry and what makes that piece a quality one
9245758 jewelry is such a unique way to express your individual style and taste
9245759 my future plans are to find the latest fashions in jewelry the newest trends and offer a wider selection of types of gemstones and fashions
9245760 i want to educate my customers about how to know they are getting high quality jewelry
9245761 i want to talk about the fun aspects of it such as fashion expressions styles and trends
9245762 my customers get personal attention because i am a smaller business i have a commitment to quality and integrity
9245763 seg n los datos preliminares de que disponemos creemos que este a o el agujero en la capa de ozono estar en los niveles medios
9245764 i always liked ted and i dont want to say i dislike him now
9245765 what the hell am i going to do with a locker anyway
9245766 when he picked up the phone again after he dropped it he said oh god brett
9245767 he said brett playing here is not an option those were his exact exact words
9245768 theres no guarantees i come back and i play as well as i did last year but if youre a betting man and you said ok who gives us the best chance to win right now and this is not bragging but i would think i would
9245769 aaron may play great and then they all look like geniuses but to not welcome me back and im just assuming for fear of upsetting aaron not only now but in the future is totally ridiculous totally ridiculous
9245770 why do these people have to be so friggin predictable
9245771 that mccain picked a woman he doesnt know well and who has little experience suggests he continues to progress as a pragmatic political realist
9245772 take a look at this video from the abc affiliate in alaska and notice that palin seems to have been caught rather blatantly misusing her power and then lying about it
9245773 for that matter lets not forget that palin fired the alaska public safety commissioner for the most dubious of reasons and then replaced him with a guy facing a credible sexual harassment accusation and who was out of the job two weeks later what a great example of sound judgment
9245774 the american people are tired of a government where good hard working public servants are fired for unlawful political reasons show headline clips from us attorney scandal tired of the republican record of scandal and not telling the truth clips from the abramoff scandal the wmd lies and from the stevens young scandals showing them from alaska etc tired of republicans who dont care about government undermining the public good by appointing unqualified inexperienced friends to important positions video of the
9245775 what matters most right now is john mccains comically dangerous sense of judgment he picked a running mate he met once for 15 minutes whos been the governor of a small state for a year and a half and who is in the midst of an abuse of power investigation in which she appears to have lied rather blatantly she has no obvious expertise in any area and no record of any kind of federal issues mccain doesnt care sensible people of sound mind and character simply dont things like this leaders dont do things like this its the height of arrogance its manifestly unserious its reckless and irresponsible it mocks the political process faced with a major presidential test mccain thought it wise to tell an imprudent joke of lasting consequence
9245776 hell i can pull anything over on you fools you wouldnt know a politician from a pony
9245777 i was also struck by mccains willingness to gamble not just with our country but with his own campaign
9245778 unfortunately for you lefties she has more executive experience than bho
9245779 what do you think of senator mccains vice presidential choice and how does it change the dynamics of this campaign
9245780 well i dont know governor palin i have not met her before i had a brief conversation with her after she was selected to congratulate her and wish her luck but not too much luck on the campaign trial and she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and a up and coming public servant
9245781 so its too early for me to gauge what kind of running mate shell be
9245782 my sense is that she subscribes to john mccains agenda and ultimately this election is going to be about where i want to take the country and where joe biden wants to take the country and where john mccain and his running mate want to take the country
9245783 i was also struck by mccains willingness to gamble not just with our country but with his own campaign
9245784 unfortunately for you lefties she has more executive experience than bho
9245785 i think hilzoys test marketing of the spin that mccain is gambling with the country is talking down to his readers
9245786 the democrats look down on you and the choices youve made
9245787 we have always held to the hope the belief the conviction that there is a better life a better world beyond the horizon
9245788 there are more media jobs out there than people think
9245789 especially robust is the job market for entry level professionals the latest addition to the employer favorite media job profile is the social media jobs top companies like microsoft ibm intel gm google and others have created new job titles such as social media marketers community managers social media strategists and specialists
9245790 most of americas major unsolved challenges revolve around these 14 questions to move america forward the next president needs a substantive plan for tackling them going in and voters deserve to know what that plan is
9245791 were pleased that senator obama has provided voters with that substantive plan and were hoping for similarly thoughtful responses from senator mccain
9245792 ensuring that the u s continues to lead the world in science and technology will be a central priority for my administration
9245793 our talent for innovation is still the envy of the world but we face unprecedented challenges that demand new approaches
9245794 we are grateful for senator obamas detailed responses and look forward to receiving the same from senator mccain
9245795 after that we hope the candidates will want to discuss their differences science debate 2008 and its partners once again extend an invitation to both candidates to attend a televised debate or forum where these vital issues can be discussed in front of a broader audience
9245796 apart from humanitarian concerns the partys image makers are mindful of the public relations and political nightmare the hurricane could pose if pictures of partying delegates alternate with scenes of evacuees fleeing the storm the timing also brings back memories of a low point in the bush administration its bungled response to hurricane katrina which swamped new orleans three years ago this last friday the presidents travel plans and a planned monday night speech to the convention were also subject to gustavs whims
9245797 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
9245798 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
9245799 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
9245800 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
9245801 so if he were to pick governor kaine it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what im really not first and foremost concerned with is this person capable of being president of the united states
9245802 is this really the most qualified person mccain could find
9245803 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
9245804 mccain has the mature judgement to admit his mistakes and correct them
9245805 she has never publicly demonstrated the kind of interest much less expertise in federal issues and foreign affairs that should mark a candidate for the second highest office in the land most people would acknowledge that regardless of her charm and good intentions palin is not ready for the top job mccain seems to have put his political interests ahead of the nations when he created the possibility that she might fill it
9245806 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9245807 john mccain looked all over the united states to find the single republican who is qualified to be as the saying goes a heartbeat away from the presidency and he came up with sarah palin really l ets be honest here her resume is as thin as the meat in a vending machine sandwich the long and short of it is this were not sure shes a competent governor of alaska and yet mccain who is no spring chicken has decided shes the best choice to replace him as president if he should win and then fall afoul of the grim reaper sarah palin really
9245808 palin tends to oversimplify complex issues has had difficulty delegating authority and clearly has some difficulty distinguishing the line between her public responsibilities and private wishes it is clear that she has not paid much attention to the nitty gritty unglamorous work of government of gaining consensus and making difficult compromises she seems to be of the view that politics should be all rather simple that often appeals to the wider public but frustrates those who see themselves as laboring in the less glamorous parts of the vineyard
9245809 if we gave you the go ahead to drill and exploit today when would the additional energy supplies come on line and how much would they help
9245810 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9245811 in this very competitive election for them to go pick somebody who is under a cloud of suspicion who is under investigation for abuse of power it just sounds like a pretty slow start to me we need a vice president who can step in if god forbid something happened to john mccain i dont think shes someone who is ready for that 3am phone call
9245812 this shocking choice says more about mccain s desperation than it does about palin s qualifications
9245813 either sarah palin has talents and skills we were not aware of
9245814 john mccain wants sarah palin to be a heartbeat away from being president joe biden would be ready do you know sarah palin enough to be sure that she is most americans have never heard of sarah palin former runner up in the miss alaska pageant and still in her scandal plagued show clips re troopergate first term as governor of alaska but alaskans know her first hand and much better than anyone else does what do respected alaskans including republican officials and opinion writers have to say about sarah palin big blow ups of the quotes above with voice overs reading them probably female voice talent maybe john mccain didnt really know her either headlines about only talking to her twice john mccain more of the same political judgments not change we can believe in vote obama biden for real judgement real leadership real change
9245815 sarah palin is an unknown young first term governor of a uniquely situated state with extreme right wing views that are far outside the mainstream views against birth control even for married couples views against choice even for victims of rape and incenst views against nearly every environmental protection the republicans have argued that obama is just a little older and is in his first term as a us senator and they call it even the american public knows nonsense when they hear it a us senator deals much more with national and international issues day in and day out than the governor of alaska obamas time in the illinois state senate was longer than palins time as mayor of a town of just 8000 people obama has strong record as a community organizer harvard law review editor and professor of constitutional law more important however most americans have known obama for more than 4 years since his stirring speech at the 2004 convention americans have had an opportunity to judge for themselves his knowledge of the issues and his readiness for the past 19 months he has campaigned across the country his readiness tested in over 20 debates with an exceptionally talented group of opponents including the obviously tough hillary clinton like former ambassador cabinet member and current new mexico governor bill richardson well recognized experts on domestic policy like senator chris dodd and well recognized and ready to lead experts on foreign policy like joe biden we know barack obama was well tested and found ready rising to the top of a strong field of contenders in a long tough process can anyone really say that about sarah palin who is unknown on the national stage and who john mccain talked two only twice before selecting her at a crucial time of troubles at home and threats abroad do you know sarah palin well enough to take that chance
9245816 what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes
9245817 i said to walt this cant be happening because his advance team didnt come to alaska to check her out
9245818 how a hockey mom turned alaskas political establishment on its ear
9245819 ericksons description kind of makes palin sound like george w bush doesnt it
9245820 palin tends to oversimplify complex issues has had difficulty delegating authority
9245821 the footage i screened tonight was met with disappointment and concern
9245822 the result was quite unimpressive but im left wondering whether it was the editor to blame for this 20 minute cut or whether the film really has problems
9245823 the movie is gorgeously mounted in minute period detail complete with swooping crane shots and intricate camera moves button has a burnished sepia polish
9245824 though the reel gives every hint that button is a proper epic tearjerker about love and pain and time its also infused with the dry quippy sense of humor that cuts through the darkest swatches of finchers filmography

9245829 widespread death destruction and terrorization of millions upon millions of the earths inhabitants
9245830 pro life voters of either party can now support sen obama on the basis that more lives will be saved than if they had just taken a moral stand hoping to overturn roe v wade
9245831 im just speaking to one issue at a time here
9245832 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
9245833 could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment

9245839 according to the ketchikan daily news edition on august 8 2006 this is what sarah palin rushed over to tell the voters of ketchikan during the primary election campaign people across the nation struggle with the idea of building a bridge because they ve been under these misperceptions about the bridge and the purpose said palin who described the link as the ketchikan area s potential for expansion and growth palin said alaska s congressional delegation worked hard to obtain funding for the bridge as part of a package deal and that she would not stand in the way of the progress toward that bridge and according to the ketchikan daily news on september 29 2006 this is what sarah palin rushed over to tell the voters of ketchikan during the general election campaign part of my agenda is making sure that southeast is heard that your projects are important that we go to bat for southeast when we re up against federal influences that aren t in the best interest of southeast she cited the widespread negative attention focused on the gravina island crossing project we need to come to the defense of southeast alaska when proposals are on the table like the bridge and not allow the spinmeisters to turn this project or any other into something that s so negative palin says
9245840 what is it exactly that the vice president does all day
9245841 ive been so focused on state government i havent really focused much on the war in iraq i heard on the news about the new deployments
9245842 senators such as hutchison dole snowe collins and murkowski were skipped over as were more experienced governors like lingle and rell as were
9245843 women dont think with their big head they think with their little hood
9245844 a debate about who has the temperment and judgement to be president of the united states
9245845 executive experience than the mayor of a town of 7000 people are they all qualified to be president of course not
9245846 fine you wont let me have who i want gimme whoever that other one was the alaskan woman whatever her name is
9245847 john mccain doesnt know sarah palin but he wants the nation to trust her
9245848 but for the rest of us theres still no change mccain doesnt get it calling this broken economy strong wants to keep spending ten billion a month in iraq and votes with george bush 90 percent of the time so while this may be his running mate america knows this is john mccains agenda and we cant afford four more years of the same
9245849 mccain is promising to double down on the economic policies of george w bush
9245850 im looking forward to my debate with governor palin after all by the end of it ill know her better than john mccain does
9245851 answer two if mcdonalds comes out with a mcshit sandwich burger king doesnt need to run a campaign to counter it its a shit sandwich it speaks for itself
9245852 sarah palin is an awful choice for a running mate
9245853 palin isnt the issue here mccains judgment is its completely off the wall is there something wrong with him
9245854 but that doesnt change the fact that this is the single most ridiculous development in presidential politics in a generation
9245855 my friend explained to me a variety of reasons why john mccains campaign will benefit significantly as a result of this move i suspect hes probably right
9245856 if theres a more complete collapse in modern political times from hero to clown i cant think of it
9245857 hey that guy obama doesnt have any experience relative to mine and hes leading me in the polls so what the hell does experience matter in a choice
9245858 sleepwalking and eating driving or naming a running mate while not fully awake with amnesia for the event have been reported if you experience any of these behaviors contact your provider immediately
9245859 campaigns have their ads their polls and their tactics but at the end of the day credible people who care about the country know that this is more than just a theatrical game the future of the nation counts more than the future of a candidate
9245860 most people put more thought into who they would have sex with than mccain did in deciding who is heir to the presidency of the united states
9245861 sarah palin is going to learn national security at the foot of the master for the next four years and most doctors think that hell be around at least that long
9245862 in the event of a tragedy or national calamity and a president mccain were unable to carry out his duties who does john mccain believe is the single best most trustworthy most capable most reliable person in the entire united states to lead the free world
9245863 i just want to see mccain or one of his top aides say this with a straight face just once
9245864 she s a fresh new face in a party that s dying for one
9245865 she looks great on the stump and speaks very well
9245866 i think she is fantastic she is a fresh face for the republican party that adds to the diversity of the party
9245867 she brings a lot to the table but i think the most important thing she brings is a fresh face to the republican party
9245868 im pretty excited i have to say this could of course turn out to be an enormous debacle if she isnt ready for prime time but for now sarah palin looks like a perfect face for the sort of republican party i want to support
9245869 in the event of a tragedy or national calamity and a president mccain were unable to carry out his duties who does john mccain believe is the single best most trustworthy most capable most reliable person in the entire united states to lead the free world
9245870 they never expected to be turned down by all the others
9245871 obama a do nothing president nothing fixed yet economy still in shambles
9245872 according to the ketchikan daily news edition on august 8 2006 this is what sarah palin rushed over to tell the voters of ketchikan during the primary election campaign people across the nation struggle with the idea of building a bridge because they ve been under these misperceptions about the bridge and the purpose said palin who described the link as the ketchikan area s potential for expansion and growth palin said alaska s congressional delegation worked hard to obtain funding for the bridge as part of a package deal and that she would not stand in the way of the progress toward that bridge and according to the ketchikan daily news on september 29 2006 this is what sarah palin rushed over to tell the voters of ketchikan during the general election campaign part of my agenda is making sure that southeast is heard that your projects are important that we go to bat for southeast when we re up against federal influences that aren t in the best interest of southeast she cited the widespread negative attention focused on the gravina island crossing project we need to come to the defense of southeast alaska when proposals are on the table like the bridge and not allow the spinmeisters to turn this project or any other into something that s so negative palin says
9245873 what is it exactly that the vice president does all day
9245874 ive been so focused on state government i havent really focused much on the war in iraq i heard on the news about the new deployments
9245875 the republicans now propose to give us a president who combines the memory skills of reagan the instincts and knowledge of bush and the class consciousness of marie antoinette someone who doesnt even have the judgement to have learned after years of being tortured that torture is a bad thing
9245876 senator mccain youve maintained that the fight against islamist extremism is the transcendent issue of our time and that in fact were engaged in wwiii right now given that and given the other recent international crises weve been facing across the globe who do you think is tougher and more qualified to go head to head with osama bin laden mahmoud ahmadinejaz vladimir putin and kim jong il joe biden or sarah palin feel free to take a minute before answering senator
9245877 he thinks women are so stupid theyll vote for another woman no matter her position on issues important to women and families
9245878 the palin selection completely undercuts the argument about obamas inexperience and readiness to lead to gratuitously undercut the remarkably successful is he ready to lead line of attack seems near suicidal
9245879 i realize of course that shes totally unqualified to be president at this point in time if mccain were to die in february 2009 i hope palin would have the good sense to appoint someone who is more ready to be president to be her vice president on the understanding that she would then resign and be appointed vice president by her successor
9245880 can anyone say with a straight face that palin would have gotten picked if she were a man
9245881 the longer i think about it the less well this selection sits with me and i increasingly doubt that it will prove good politics the palin choice looks cynical its a wild gamble undertaken by our oldest ever first time candidate for president in hopes of changing the board of this election campaign maybe it will work but maybe and at least as likely it will reinforce a theme that id be pounding home if i were the obama campaign that its john mccain for all his white hair who represents the risky choice while it is barack obama who offers cautious steady predictable governance if it were your decision and you were putting your country first would you put an untested small town mayor a heartbeat away from the presidency
9245882 as much as i loathe obama biden i cant in good conscience vote for a mccain palin ticket palin has absolutely no experience in foreign affairs considering both mccains advanced age and the state of the world today it is essential that the veep be exceedingly qualified to assume the office of president i simply dont have any confidence in palins ability to deal effectively with iran russia china etc
9245883 on the face of it mccain has failed the ultimate test that any presidential candidate must face in picking a running mate selecting someone who is unambiguously qualified to be president
9245884 thats the most serious bit of punditry that woman has ever uttered
9245885 former house speaker gail phillips a republican political leader who has clashed with palin in the past was shocked when she heard the news friday morning with her husband walt
9245886 i said to walt this cant be happening because his advance team didnt come to alaska to check her out
9245887 were not a very big state people i talk to would have heard something
9245888 that mccain picked a woman he doesnt know well and who has little experience suggests he continues to progress as a pragmatic political realist
9245889 never mind palins views on choice 100 against it or any other issue that hillarys supporters care about
9245890 i was skeptical establishes credibility but shes won me over in a big way stays in line with the mores of wingnuttia
9245891 if you suddenly became the president what is the first thing you would do
9245892 my role as governor is where i can be most helpful right now unless something drastic happens and i don t anticipate that right now
9245893 what separates her from others is that at a time when republicans have suffered from the taint of corruption she represents clean politics
9245894 the public stereotype of republican is a wrinkled old guy taking cash under the table
9245895 one way for republicans to break the stereotype is with a female reformer
9245896 the public stereotype of republican is a wrinkled old guy taking cash under the table
9245897 i f she does a good job at the convention and survives about three weeks of serious media scrutiny
9245898 he does get emotional sometimes and i will encourage him be more rational and less emotional with his posts in the future lest he wind up like msmuddled
9245899 someone should post odds on whether palin will go on a hunting trip with cheney and who shoots whom first
9245900 best choice possible that rock never met ayers or wright
9245901 brilliant choice that rock has at least 50 million years of experience
9245902 a great pick that rock will be useful in that fence to keep the mexicans out
9245903 i was skeptical establishes credibility but shes won me over in a big way stays in line with the mores of wingnuttia
9245904 chico you really think theres no difference between being a state senator a us senator a harvard law graduate president of the law review and a woman who was until 20 months ago the mayor of a town so small it barely has a name

9245973 si tratta di un fenomeno assai preoccupante che deve essere posto allattenzione non solo dellagenzia delle entrate ma anche dello stesso ministro delleconomia perch denuncia una notevole divaricazione tra attivit di verifica ed attivit di riscossione

9245980 dialogo solo con chi responsabile altrimenti meglio lasciar perdere con questa opposizione mi sembra difficile
9245981 il dialogo dice il cavaliere sempre il benvenuto ma se dallaltra parte ci sono comportamenti tali per cui gli interlocutori si comportano in una certa maniera difficile tenerlo vivo
9245982 se ci sono persone responsabili per dialogare io sono felice ma se c un altro tipo di opposizione meglio non dialogare noi andremo avanti con la massima serenit di spirito governare significa decidere sulle leggi e anche per la legge costituzionale

9246225 al momento mi pare che si tenda a blindare il pi possibile il provvedimento continua il presidente della crui nelle finanziarie precedenti si partiva da delle ipotesi qui c rigidit temo che per il 2009 i cambiamenti siano da considerarsi acquisiti speriamo di riuscire a dimostrare e a rendere esplicito che il sistema cos non pu reggere

9246317 oggi ci siamo riuniti con il popolo palestinese per manifestare la nostra simpatia per le sue sofferenze la presenza del primo ministro sharon a washington un affronto per gli ebrei credenti e per i palestinesi sofferenti
9246318 e proprio perch siamo ebrei che stiamo chiedendo il ritorno dei palestinesi alle loro case e la restituzione delle loro propriet cosa c di pi ingiusto del programma del movimento sionista in atto da un secolo di invadere le terre di un altro popolo di espellere la gente ed espropriarla dei suoi beni
9246319 i primi sionisti hanno dichiarato di essere un popolo senza terra diretto verso una terra senza popolo ma le parole erano totalmente e profondamente false la palestina era una paese appartenente ad un popolo
9246320 i progetti di spartire la cisgiordania e di tagliarla in pezzi come fu proposto da barak a camp david
9246321 occorre chiedere scusa al popolo palestinese in modo chiaro e preciso il sionismo vi ha rubato le vostre case il sionismo vi ha rubato la vostra terra
9246322 che atroce bugia dire che i palestinesi in particolare ed i musulmani in generale avrebbero in odio gli ebrei voi odiate lingiustizia non gli ebrei
9246323 dappertutto nel mondo si trovano numerosi ebrei credenti che si dichiarano inorriditi dal comportamento criminale e razzista verso i palestinesi da parte dei sionisti

9246328 dopo la sua esperienza di combattente durante la quale si esercitava anche su come occupare i villaggi palestinesi consapevole che nella realt si trattava di combattere anche donne e bambini ha capito che i due popoli erano coinvolti in un circolo vizioso di violenza la violenza delluno che alimenta la violenza dellaltro
9246329 la politica di assassini mirati del governo sharon mi ha fatto riflettere dicevano che erano politiche di prevenzione invece sono crimini di guerra ho cercato di coinvolgere altri piloti a rifiutarsi di eseguire questi assassini
9246330 il prossimo passo sar quello di andare al di l delle linee cercare altri con i quali dialogare per cambiare la realt e se collaboreremo israeliani e palestinesi credo che potremo davvero cambiare le cose
9246331 in israele quello che per alcuni miei amici sarebbe lesercito pi etico del mondo uccide i bambini nei territori occupati e controlla la vita di 3 5 milioni di palestinesi
9246332 dobbiamo ricordare che le sofferenze dei palestinesi che vivono sotto occupazione israeliana quali che siano le responsabilit della maggioranza della loro classe dirigente sono disperate come quelle degli ebrei deuropa orientale al tempo del primo congresso di basilea il futuro dello stato ebraico legato a quello della nazione palestinese che vive accanto e allinterno dello stato stesso

9246384 non conosco il dettaglio di quella prova desame ma comunque il punteggio dellorale di cui fa parte la tesina e solo come avvio del colloquio pesa per 35 punti rispetto ai 45 delle altre prove
9246385 composta da 3 docenti interni tre esterni e un presidente esterno anchegli
9246386 il nostro compito era picchiarli era come fare la guerra senza armi da fuoco si tendevano imboscate ed era come un gioco di gatto e topo personalmente io spaccai le gambe ad un bambino qui ad un altro l con le mani o con i manganelli gli adulti venivano picchiati in modo molto pesante cera un tipo che aveva una televisione a casa e la pattuglia a piedi andava usualmente a casa sua per guardare la coppa del mondo di calcio finch egli divenne tanto agitato da dirci di prenderci il televisore eravamo come la polizia ma senza legge non per corruzione ma perch facevamo ci che volevamo perch noi eravamo la legge controllando la strada
9246387 nessuno aveva avuto una istruzione su come fare la guerra nei territori noi volevamo essere soldati da combattimento e ci battevamo come pensavamo si dovesse pi tardi capimmo che si doveva eseguire un ordine di detenzione e che non si poteva picchiare la gente senza buone ragioni non era realistico io sarei andato a casa e un arabo si sarebbe seduto accanto sullautobus e sarebbe trascorso un quarto dora senza chiedergli di mostrare una carta didentit o sferrargli un colpo vivevo in due mondi separati ed il cambiamento avveniva quando si indossava luniforme e si andava a casa l si trovava un mondo diverso dove nessuno desiderava ucciderti e tu non volevi picchiare nessuno di domenica sarei ritornato alla base e tutto sarebbe ricominciato e veramente strano ma noi non parliamo di sentimenti e di cose come queste facciamo il lavoro
9246388 certamente il mio comportamento nel kibbutz non uguale al comportamento che ho a gaza sono due mondi paralleli e la stessa personalit che reagisce in modo diverso nei due casi opposti ma tu sei la stessa persona sviluppiamo personalit diverse perch dobbiamo fare quel lavoro allinizio del mio servizio mi identificavo con il mapam un partito di sinistra che ora fa parte del meretz e non cera modo che io potessi picchiare qualcuno ma a rafah vieni colpito da una pietra e poi da unaltra pietra ed accumuli tanta rabbia che esplode in modo violento e questa veniva ritenuta che fosse la nostra reazione noi eravamo l per ripagarli probabilmente ci mi ha reso pi rozzo i miei punti di vista politici sono cambiati sotto le armi sono diventato di destra e voto per il partito nazionale religioso me ne sono andato nel 1991 ho lavorato per met anno in un kibbutz e poi sono andato in olanda dove ho lavorato nel turismo per pochi anni e feci anche formaggi e zoccoli di legno l ho anche fumato liberamente droghe nel 1995 sono andato in india
9246389 sono stato tre anni nellesercito dopo non abbiamo ottenuto lavori di favore o condizioni per studiare alluniversit e qui non ci aspettiamo un miracolo molti dei ragazzi della compagnia hanno lasciato il paese io sono un contadino e quando ritornai dallindia ho trovato il posto pieno di thai il mondo non stava certamente aspettando il nostro ritorno al kibbutz io non me la sento di dire di essere stato usato entrai nellesercito di mia spontanea volont e non avrei servito altro esercito nel mondo
9246390 e maturato e cambiato nellesercito ho mandato un buon kibbutznik ed ho ricevuto indietro uno che odia gli arabi
9246391 noi abbiamo chiesto alle autorit di avere un villaggio rurale abbiamo chiesto qualcosa che si adatti alle necessit agricole dei beduini abbiamo trattato con le autorit fin dal 1987 ma non abbiamo ottenuto alcuna risposta
9246392 tutte queste fattorie rappresentano un ulteriore tentativo di giudeizzare il territorio
9246393 la vita non cos facile ma non neppure cos difficile
9246394 dallesperienza si sa che i vicini non lavorano a lungo termine se tu li licenzi dopo potresti avere qualche problema alcuni affaristi pagano denaro per la protezione ai beduini
9246395 i beduini pensano che il negev appartenga ai beduini e che gli ebrei non hanno alcun diritto di sistemarsi qui il governo riconosce che i beduini non abbiano alcun diritto hanno intenzione di risolvere il problema
9246396 ci prova latteggiamento razzista nei confronti degli arabi beduini nel negev
9246397 non tutti vogliono essere dei contadini ma in gran parte lo diventano il governo non offre loro le condizioni necessarie non fornisce neppure lacqua da bere concede solo lacqua per coltivare
9246398 parte dei villaggi dovrebbero essere dedicati allagricoltura ed allindustria in tal modo la gente potrebbe vivere in modo onorevole trovando unoccupazione cos la gente potrebbe studiare e dedicarsi ad attivit pi ricercate
9246399 ora sono in pensione loro mi hanno imbrogliato se andare sotto le armi avesse procurato qualche vantaggio vi avrei mandato tutti i miei figli ma io sono stato avvelenato e non voglio che facciano lo stesso con loro
9246400 il vicino aveva la leucemia unaltra donna aveva il cancro al sistema digestivo fu portata allospedale e mor 45 giorni dopo ma sono cose difficili da dimostrare se noi facessimo causa avremmo bisogno di molto denaro e sarebbe una lunga battaglia legale
9246401 hanno pensato di dover evacuare la gente dalla zona non hanno neppure cominciato qui preferirei un altro impiego e pericoloso per la nostra salute e veleno
9246402 non hanno trasmesso quello che hai detto per paura degli spettatori ebrei in francia
9246403 non sfrutter il sangue di mia figlia per scopi politici questo il grido di un uomo non perder il mio senno proprio perch ho perduto il mio cuore
9246404 signore non essere n con noi n contro di noi
9246405 ha ascoltato le loro storie e li ha consolati assicurando la sua vicinanza spirituale
9246406 assicurando la sua vicinanza spirituale spiega la nota della sala stampa vaticana ha promesso di continuare a pregare per loro per le loro famiglie e per tutte le vittime
9246407 con questo gesto paterno aggiunge il comunicato il santo padre ha voluto dimostrare ancora una volta la sua sollecitudine nei confronti di tutti coloro che hanno sofferto per gli abusi sessuali
9246408 tutto si svolto in un clima di rispetto di spiritualit e di intensa commozione
9246409 come gi avvenuto negli stati uniti il papa ha desiderato incontrare alcune vittime come gesto concreto per esprimere i sentimenti da lui gi manifestati pi volte nei suoi interventi sul dramma degli abusi sessuali
9246410 ha desiderato farlo dopo la conclusione delle giornate mondiali della giovent perch queste erano il motivo specifico del suo viaggio
9246411 questi misfatti che costituiscono un cos grave tradimento della fiducia aveva proseguito devono essere condannati in modo inequivocabile essi hanno causato grande dolore e hanno danneggiato la testimonianza della chiesa le vittime devono ricevere compassione e cura e i responsabili di questi mali devono essere portati davanti alla giustizia e una priorit urgente quella di promuovere un ambiente pi sicuro e pi sano specialmente per i giovani
9246412 signore non essere n con noi n contro di noi
9246413 spesso non rispettano le regole e gli orari perche si qualificano come laboratori artigiani e fanno concorrenza sleale
9246414 mi aspetto una chiarissima netta e non scherzosa presa di distanze da parte del presidente del consiglio
9246415 i presidenti di camera e senato ad aprire le sedute dellaula nel pomeriggio con parole di condanna del fatto che il simbolo dellunit nazionale sia stato fatto oggetto dei gesti e delle parole offensivi pronunciate ieri dal ministro umberto bossi
9246416 metto insieme parole e gesti di bossi e la frase del capogruppo del pdl gasparri che ha definito il csm una cloaca e mi chiedo si possono rubricare sotto la specie dei moderati no siamo di fronte alla estremizzazione del conflitto permanente contro tutti i soggetti istituzionali e politici
9246417 gli intelletuali di sinistra giudicano senza aver letto nemmeno un mio libro ne ho scitti tanti sulla riforma religiosa del 500 lo sa che non ho ricevuto una recensione avrei preferito una stroncatura a questo silenzio
9246418 con tutta la mia buona volont evidentemente non riesco a farmi capire
9246419 da stasera fino a chiusura alla festa dellunit sar suonato linno nazionale
9246420 a me linno di mameli non mai piaciuto fin dai tempi della scuola preferisco la canzone del piave quella che fa il piave mormorava calmo e placido quella una canzone di popolo pi vicina alla marsigliese
9246421 adesso sono tutti pronti a saltar su una cosa cos detta davanti ad una platea come quella veneta che calda nella concitazione del momento dice il leader della lega quasi a volersi giustificare ma certamente a me linno di mameli non piace il poeta us questa frase schiava di roma che non ho mai sopportato il problema sul contenuto non sullinno in quanto inno ditalia le parole dellinno non mi piacciono e lho sempre detto
9246422 quella parola schiava aggiunge bossi non la sopporto noi siamo per abolirla la schiavit in ogni sua accezione e cos ho anche detto che il nord la lombardia il veneto mica possono essere schiavi di qualcuno e allora perch non usare come inno quella canzone del piave che mi ha sempre commosso quella popolare trascinante somiglia come intonazione e come senso patriottico alla marsigliese
9246423 marcia indietro assurda costiamo pochissimo e siamo allavanguardia in europa
9246424 e una provocazione priva di senso perch i costi di gestione sono irrisori commentava qualche giorno fa il presidente matteo fusilli allipotesi di soppressione degli enti parco i consiglieri non ricevono indennit e partecipano alle riunioni come atto di volontariato fuori dallorario di lavoro
9246425 andando avanti su questa strada denuncia ancora il presidente di federparchi da primi ci troveremmo ultimi siamo stati noi italiani a inventare la gestione dei parchi allargata a scienziati enti locali imprenditori illuminati leuropa ci ha seguito su questa strada perch ha visto che funzionava e ora dovremmo fare marcia indietro
9246426 lipotesi di trasferimento della gestione a fondazioni private conclude fusilli sembra segnalare la volont di sgravare il pubblico di una responsabilit che invece gli spetta sempre e comunque perch riguarda la pianificazione del territorio e la tutela di beni inalienabili come le acque le foreste le coste la flora e la fauna selvatiche

9246431 no se fa la coda a venti ani se resta moni per sempre
9246432 ma vedi io credo invece esattamente il contrario ognuno di noi dovrebbe mettercene molta di pi di vita personale perch la vita personale rispecchia tutto ci che abbiamo imparato quindi non solo la nostra cultura ma specialmente i nostri meccanismi mentali acquisiti tramite la cultura rispecchia una filosofia che non si impara in nessun libro il blog un territorio di scambio di idee la vita il terreno in cui crescono e si sviluppano le idee ognuno di noi ha sempre da imparare da acquisire da confrontare in nome di cosa dovremmo sottrarci a raccontare la vita e una forma di letteratura anche questa come le poesie solo che mentre le poesie sono di altri quello che raccontiamo di noi nostro vuoi mettere la differenza
9246433 caro az sono andato a curiosare nel tuo sito e mi venuta la pelle doca io e te abbiamo una cosa allucinante in comune
9246434 fin che i cretini fanno eh fin che i cretini fanno ah fin che i cretini fanno boh tutto resta uguale ma se i bambini fanno ohh basta la vocale io mi vergogno un po invece i grandi fanno no io chiedo asilo io chiedo asilo come i leoni io voglio andare a gattoni e ognuno perfetto uguale il colore evviva i pazzi che hanno capito cosa lamore tutto un fumetto di strane parole che io non ho letto voglio tornare a fare oh perch i bambini non hanno peli ne sulla pancia ne sulla lingua
9246435 grandi storie anche qui si fa per dire leggendo un libro del laslett
9246436 quando dostoevskij diceva che la bellezza avrebbe salvato il mondo pensava alla trasfigurazione del mondo allavvento del regno di dio

9246438 continuo a dire che gerusalemme sar la capitale di israele
9246439 lho sempre ripetuto ha aggiunto il senatore dellillinois ma ho anche detto che si tratta di uno status finale che dovr essere deciso dai negoziati
9246440 il mondo deve evitare che liran ottenga un arma nucleare
9246441 gli iraniani devono capire che sia lamministrazione bush che se sar quella di obama la preoccupazione propria degli usa
9246442 penso che per noi ci sia anche la possibilit di applicare sanzioni pi rigide alliran ma anche di di migliorare la relazioni con la comunit internazionale nel momento in cui decidano di interrompere il nucleare
9246443 motivi superiori che a mio avviso peraltro non sono mai esistiti e non possono esistere a fronte dellinviolabilit della vita uname e specie dei pi deboli

9246457 you knew it would come to this sooner or later
9246458 any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 5 per gallon
9246459 wed be up to our waist in water here and it would be navigable
9246460 you could come out here with boats all the fishermen would be up and down with their fishing gear and pulling in the catch
9246461 but this is the middle of winter and it looks like a desert
9246462 this area is on the very brink of environmental collapse
9246463 you see the lack of birds and the lack of life you smell it you can smell the water if you walk out into the lake bed you can burn your feet because of the acid sulphates
9246464 its very real and its happening right in front of us
9246465 to see my parents on the day that the animals left all they could see was everything that weve worked for for 30 years going down the track its also my future going down the track
9246466 we could have held on but we did it for the benefit of the cows we just didnt want to put them through it the cows spent more time dealing with the salt in the water than producing milk
9246467 we managed to unify the railways shortly after federation but its taken us a century to do anything about water and its still extremely difficult because the water in those river systems is over allocated its a 130 allocation and that was in a good year
9246468 so when were facing a really serious water deficit there just isnt any water any more
9246469 we are now looking at a situation where we could either have an aral sea or a series of acid lakes the options we have shrink by the week because theres less water in the system look things are really grim
9246470 since the government cannot resolve the problem even the courts cannot resolve the problem the joint session of parliament is the best choice for finding a solution
9246471 you cannot make a plan for this based on katrina please keep an eye on it
9246472 if it were the new i phone coming out today that you wanted you wouldnt have been to busy i assure you

9246478 we were able to come back and minimize errors then we played the next two sets consistently
9246479 we had a lot of people doing well even though the competition wasnt the toughest were going to see this season we were able to serve and hit the ball inbounds consistently our offense was great
9246480 thats what we expect to see from her all year long

9246488 like other family members dogs and cats deserve the best health care available
9246489 they may have names like fluffy meathead and trouble but theyre every bit as loved as any other member of the family
9246490 the trainer said if we were going to have a dog who was going to be socialized appropriately and not have any issues we had to have her meet 100 people a week so she wouldnt develop any phobias plus 25 to 50 dogs
9246491 when i was a kid if your dog was hit by a car and was badly hurt youd take him out back and youd shoot him
9246492 you wouldnt take him to a vet to have him put down you did it yourself it was kind of an act of honoring the dog an act of love
9246493 said in effect that as long as there are emergency departments no one in america is really uninsured
9246494 theres no such thing as being uninsured after all you can always get treatment at an emergency department
9246495 the president of the national center for policy analysis an important conservative think tank wants the next president to issue an executive order prohibiting the census bureau from classifying anyone as uninsured
9246496 our younger kids came in and played with a sense of urgency they were aggressive
9246497 ryan did a great job of taking what the defense gave him
9246498 sometimes hes going to do bad stuff but we have to coach him through those things
9246499 the good thing about this trip is that well get to see them do things we didnt let them do in practice we didnt go up and down the court much in practice
9246500 nothing i have tried so far has jump started my business like the sfi affiliate program i know that with this program we will all succeed i am verrrrry excited
9246501 i have just started sfi and i couldnt believe my eyes this week i have had almost 60 people sign up and generated five sales just sign up at sfi it is the best opportunity i have seen on the internet
9246502 after three and a half years online i have found the most professional and best run opportunity with sfi the teamwork and support are the best around my future is now in my hands and it looks good
9246503 the sfi program works i cannot recommend any other affiliate program more strongly
9246504 i have had good experience with various online companies but sfi is far better with good products i love sfi i have already received two checks and am waiting for the third one to arrive i highly recommend that everyone joins sfi for financial and time freedom thanks sfi
9246505 mccain promised to us that he would appoint more women at cabinet level and high level positions than any other president in history
9246506 the choice of a competent woman strengthens the ticket in the eyes of those voters
9246507 we hope to sell a lot of lcd and big screen plasma televisions
9246508 other than christmas its our biggest television season of the year well have a big sale and well have high hopes
9246509 they know the majority of workers are off work monday and may use that day to shop
9246510 once upon a time back to school sales stopped when school began but in recent years its gone on for a few weeks after that because kids go back to school and see what other kids are wearing
9246511 i wish i could say that was the case everywhere but its not
9246512 the way dayton area institutions collaborate on the subject of economic growth recognizing the role that they play in the economy of this region is very significant
9246513 it particularly understands the unique role it plays in relationship to wright patterson air force base and how important that is to our economic future
9246514 its a focused growing institution and were very proud of it
9246515 weve invested recently three new faculty research positions in their research institute theyve also been a real leader on education
9246516 in terms of community building making the kind of livable community that people will want to live in
9246517 weve also encouraged them to work beyond the immediate boundaries of montgomery county too theyre doing more work in hamilton and middletown at the miami university regional campuses there clearly one of the leading community colleges in the state
9246518 the governor and the general assembly just made an extraordinary commitment to building a new student union at central state
9246519 i think its telling that the person i chose as my vice chancellor for academic affairs comes out of the adult education world because we know that two thirds of our growth of our higher education in the plan is going to be adults 25 and older
9246520 working in springfield to become an attractive part of the community to make it a more livable community
9246521 but we havent done quite as much work with them as yet
9246522 miami is really one of the best undergraduate campuses in the country president david hodge has said their goal is to be the best and provide the highest quality undergraduate education in the country we want them to be no 1
9246523 mike has been a longtime supporter of kids voting and has lent his talents to kids voting as a political cartoon judge an illustrator and spokesperson for several public service announcements so it is only natural to honor him at the bash
9246524 the minute you step through that gate we really try to take you back to renaissance england complete with queen elizabeth i
9246525 you can step back in time said bill kistner a vandalia resident on his first visit to the festival
9246526 theres no electronic games and even the shows are more personal they get the audience involved
9246527 heck ive never even chopped wood before but well probably come back next year
9246528 its the fun of dressing up in old time dress and playing with swords and all that fun stuff
9246529 in this season of high profile politics their needs to be a renewed focus on poverty
9246530 the present policy is to close plants or move jobs its the result of bad trade policy
9246531 but yesterdays middle class is today impoverished class theres a sinking feeling its an outward flow of plants and jobs and an inward flow of drugs and guns
9246532 since the recent wars in iraq and afghanistan we have seen an increased need for veteran housing and services
9246533 we realize this need and are working with other area organizations to provide veterans a place to call home proper medical attention and educational programs to help them thrive independently
9246534 i am buying another ext cab next month to do a vw diesel conversion on
9246535 generational change tends to be accelerated when the party is in trouble
9246536 its the natural order of things were really lucky in ohio quite frankly because we have some amazingly talented leaders house speaker jon husted kevin dewine state auditor mary taylor despite their youth they have some tremendous experience
9246537 i think thats going to serve the party and the state of ohio very well
9246538 i think we are in a great spot as a party having new faces and new folks and new energy and ideas on the horizon
9246539 hes been very very capable in terms of brokering deals and being able to reach across the aisle
9246540 at the same time hes remained steadfast on the core issues hes not somebody you hear people talking about with bile in their voice jon to me seems like the future of the republican party in ohio
9246541 this truck was a big disappointment in comparison to the 1994 i owned
9246542 this is the best truck out there for the money
9246543 solid tackle busting redfish action continues to dominate the fishing scene
9246544 with the best trout action being at the big jetties when the water remains clean
9246545 the calcasieu has been a roller coaster this year as for as the water level and clarity is concerned
9246546 iran is certainly taking advantage of the crisis in relations between moscow and washington in order to develop its nuclear technology
9246547 russia has sought the political support of countries in the organisation among them china but received a cool response iran could work to convince countries that are members of the sco like kazakhstan and kirghizistan to support the russian position in georgia
9246548 in exchange tehran would have strong political support for its nuclear programme
9246549 had westerners become certain that the resolutions would bring us down to our knees they would have definitely intensified them the sanctions
9246550 just what is it about this woman that scares them so much
9246551 its such a huge step compared to where weve been in healthcare
9246552 the healthcare system has been so opaque and so difficult for people to navigate its a really good start
9246553 even if consumers arent paying attention to it hospitals and doctors are paying attention and they might start working to make things better
9246554 we have about 37 bus routes and we had trouble with two routes 30 and 31
9246555 in order to fix it we had to add another bus and that impacted five other buses and when you do that on the second day of school it adds to the confusion
9246556 when i went to school we didnt have fees like this
9246557 it was included in education it doesnt matter whether its athletics drama or music kids develop in different ways and its important to be involved in outside activities
9246558 if people arent using a particular service provided by a city or town they believe they shouldnt be paying out of their tax dollars to support that service
9246559 in an ideal educational world most of us believe there would be and should be no fees
9246560 i dont know that well ever have that ideal educational world
9246561 i dont like them i think it should be free for students im sorry we have to have them
9246562 i work with families to make it as painless as possible
9246563 the way the economy is going ive had more requests now than a few years ago for deferrals people requesting waivers need the waivers i think everybody should have the opportunity to play athletics
9246564 i like to buy the school supplies because i know its part of the excitement of back to school
9246565 anything i can do to get them excited for school is great
9246566 take off your clothes and have casual sex its empowering
9246567 young women should sleep around for the sake of feminism and positive sexuality
9246568 was no doubt weaned on the v monologues brand of feminism
9246569 should be paying them out of gratitude for showing you the truth of what you are doing every day treating yourself as a walking commodity and others as consumers
9246570 is a faith based program that encourages teen girls to live act and dress in accordance with their dignity as children of god
9246571 created for women who want to be stylish sexy and engaged in the world while retaining high standards in dress entertainment and lifestyle
9246572 until recently if you wanted to buy modest clothes it was really a challenge my neighbors were buying their daughters amish clothes online which is fine unless youre not amish then it just looks weird
9246573 the unspoken message of our bodies ourselves is clear enough as long as a girl remains a virgin she remains completely asexual
9246574 dancing at a strip club with volunteering at a womens shelter in its potential to radicalize women in a positive way
9246575 is that whenever women are together alone it can be a radical space
9246576 its not a lack of female modesty but a sense of male entitlement that leads to sexual violence
9246577 and the idea that women can change mens behavior by changing our clothes is not only disconcerting it has been debunked
9246578 you dont have to rape her or kill her you dont even have to beat her
9246579 the best compliment i can pay it is that i kept forgetting it was fiction it seized me by my preconceptions and i kept struggling and arguing with its premises the womens room is a book that women are going to read to relive the stories of their lives i only wish that it contained some small comfort for men

9246581 where much proto feminist theater and dance these days by artists young enough to be solanass daughter or even granddaughter is just so much screaming solanas delivers her punches with constant hits to the funny bone as well making any sexist accusations of man hater secondary

9246592 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9246593 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9246594 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9246595 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

9246613 smith amp wesson thank you for calling how may i direct your call

9246615 okay no problem i need your federal firearm license let me guess is this shipment being sent to iraq for the u s military
9246616 no its going to a local public high school in the small town of harrold texas
9246617 yes since we authorized teachers to carry handguns in the classroom our students sat scores have gone through the roof
9246618 no in texas sat is an acronym for shoot and triage the faculty banded together and created a group called sidearm weapons and teaching otherwise known as swat let me tell you something kids dont mouth back in the classroom or during lunch break when they see a handgun on the teachers waist the program has been so successful that we are going to arm the school cafeteria workers janitors and even the school board members
9246619 well this order is expensive you are looking at approximately 150 000 did your residents really approve this budget request for firearms
9246620 oh yes it was no problem have you every been to brattleboro vermont
9246621 well in that community which has the highest property taxes in the entire world the last time the residents rejected a school budget request was in 1929 when the great depression occurred we use the technique they perfected to extract unlimited sums of money from taxpayers its really very simple just before you stand up to speak at town meeting you bite your tongue just hard enough to bring tears to your eyes you then say the following this issue pause has nothing to do with money pause and look up at ceiling as if talking to god for what we are really talking about here slowly build your voice into a crescendo is the future of our children
9246622 absolutely all the local moon bats yell yeah and its a done deal
9246623 okay ill have your order shipped out tomorrow thanks for your business
9246624 gun control historically serves as a gateway to tyranny tyrants from hitler to mao to stalin have sought to disarm their own citizens for the simple reason that unarmed people are easier to control our founders having just expelled the british army knew that the right to bear arms serves as the guardian of every other right this is the principle so often ignored by both sides in the gun control debate only armed citizens can resist tyrannical government
9246625 teachers who wish to bring guns will have to be certified to carry a concealed handgun in texas and get crisis training and permission from school officials he the school districts superintendent david thweatt said
9246626 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9246627 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9246628 i dont think the hurricane will break them but i dont want someone breaking in
9246629 there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9246630 if we dont get the wind and rain we stand ready to help them
9246631 it usually takes a couple of days before we can start to get a significant amount of production back up
9246632 it can take several days for the subsea wells typically about half of our production comes back rather quickly
9246633 but were also working with local authorities to provide fuel along evacuation routes
9246634 appropriate planning is under way to allow for the safe shut down of refinery operations and the evacuation of refinery personnel as circumstances warrant
9246635 this is the most heat incidents weve had in many years
9246636 grande parte dos lugares afetados s o ainda inacess veis
9246637 im kind of nervous it might be another katrina but we really cant stop mother nature so i cant worry about that too much
9246638 lsu seems pretty prepared but so did new orleans before katrina and look how that turned out so it seems like a false sense of security
9246639 i stayed because i think were far enough inland that nothing too bad should happen
9246640 but more importantly because its a five hour drive back home
9246641 they wouldnt have people living in them if they werent residential life knows hurricanes happen and they make sure the buildings are ok so they have nothing to worry about
9246642 lsus one of the safest places to be for this
9246643 all the buildings are structurally sound and theres people here that know what they are doing
9246644 poderemos ver uma inunda o pior do que a que vimos com o katrina

9246647 if its like katrina they might not let us back
9246648 they might put a fence around the whole parish and say go away
9246649 x left by rescuers searching for survivors after katrina a yellow sign with another red
9246650 i mean my house is not even finished and then what its going to float away again
9246651 i was hoping to get all the way right at least before another hurricane came and ate up my world
9246652 if i would have been in my house for a day it would have been ok then i could have dealt with it
9246653 i dont have a car i had to come with my neighbors
9246654 but i wasnt going to wait not after katrina these things can be killers we know it now youd have to be a fool not to get out while the gettings good
9246655 i was here three days in this house after katrina the water was over my head i floated out on an ice chest to get away
9246656 im not goin they arent gonna scare me or run me out im tired im too tired to go through it all again
9246657 we watched katrina from the cockpit of a 19 foot sailboat
9246658 thats what we do we rebuild thats the nature of mankind
9246659 katrina was hell there is a reason to have anxiety
9246660 weve paid our dues as far as im concerned i know its selfish but thats the way it is

9246666 it would have been nice if i could have scored on the first play i almost didnt know what to do
9246667 i didnt see an appalachian state defender but i felt him coming i was like o lord hes about to catch me so i wrapped up the ball and made sure he didnt pop it out
9246668 they opened some big holes for me and i just found them
9246669 i think it was the plan for me to start it off but i guess they might have gone with the hot hand also all three of us work hard when i come off the field and take a rest to watch the other guys i feel just as great
9246670 when i came off the field i wasnt really paying attention to how many yards i had
9246671 i try to stay away from personal goals and stay more team oriented it felt great but again its about the team
9246672 hes a great player and getting that first score out of the way and getting things on the right track was definitely big
9246673 we rushed the football pretty well and charles scott had a nice day i thought he could have scored on the first play but he got out of it what he could that was a nice opening run for him this year
9246674 get out of town this is not the one to play with

9246681 my friends and fellow americans i am very pleased and privileged to introduce to you the next vice president of the united states governor sarah palin of the great state of alaska
9246682 it was senator mccain who refused to hedge his support for our troops in iraq regardless of the political costs and you know now as the mother of one of those troops and as the commander of alaskas national guard thats the kind of man i want as commander in chief
9246683 get out of town this is not the one to play with

9246693 dallas has the capabilities to do the logistics and we have the desire we most definitely should go after a convention
9246694 without his blessing im not interested we wouldnt go for it
9246695 assolutamente si ho sentito le critiche a kimi ma alcune brutte gare non significano che si e in crisi
9246696 although movement has slowed slightly the fact it is still moving is significant hills arent supposed to move at all
9246697 we would expect the movement to slow when the weather is fine and the ground dries out however any heavy rain would cause substantial movement
9246698 what we do know is that at any time it could bring down hundreds of thousands of tonnes of debris
9246699 its a historic event we are going to see this more and more as the years go by
9246700 a new record low could be reached in a matter of weeks
9246701 transitioned into a different climatic state where completely ice free summers would soon become normal
9246702 the guys have always believed in their abilities and finally they showed what they can do
9246703 we only played to 70 per cent of our potential but we worked hard out there created good opportunities and they australia didnt stand a chance against us all credit to the players
9246704 this is what i expect of this group we didnt want to prove anyone wrong we simply wanted to showcase our talents
9246705 weve created chances in every match but not taken them this time around we finished off hopefully we can now build from here
9246706 im ecstatic and thrilled i never knew about the record until now
9246707 the boks are the world champions and they showed that in this competition there is very little between the sides they got into the game early on and built on their momentum
9246708 people have been feeding on de villiers all week but all credit to him and the players
9246709 we were genuinely outplayed out there they finally turned their opportunities into points that was the big difference on this occasion
9246710 the challenge for us now is to go to brisbane and beat new zealand we learned a few lessons out there today so theres a bit of work for us in the coming weeks
9246711 the girls then went back with this other man to his house overnight because it was a nice safe place for them
9246712 then they went to gisborne to report it the next morning
9246713 it is a sickening attack from the point of view that their own safety and wellbeing was put at risk but also because this area is regarded by tourists to be a beautiful place to come
9246714 the practice without a car is to get the students into a mental state of mind to know what theyre doing and what each individual has to achieve
9246715 the crew go through even the smallest of detailed movements mimicking removing and replacing various pieces of equipment that are damaged and might have to be replaced
9246716 it helps them to remember which way things come off and go back on this crew have been training since april
9246717 the purpose of taking part in the world rally championship is to equip the students with a good education in the real world
9246718 we must compete on all three days and we must complete the rally our first priority is to finish the rally we have never failed to finish a rally and we are very much looking forward to finishing in new zealand
9246719 outside it appears that things are improving but the volcano is still brewing with much intensity
9246720 i would like to be in heaven together with my believers if they kill me and them
9246721 our aim is for every single school to welcome children from all backgrounds it is a simple goal strongly supported by the public educationalists and students
9246722 there are those who attend church in order that their children qualify for admission to a particular school and never set foot in the church again after the children have been accepted
9246723 all children regardless of their religion culture and family income should have equal access to the best possible education in a good local school
9246724 allowing schools to pick and choose pupils is not the best way to achieve this or to create young adults with the confidence and personal skills to live and work in our vibrant multi cultural society
9246725 parents should be able to choose the type of education and ethos they want for their children
9246726 given the dangers of segregation and the importance of community cohesion we need schools that welcome all and are committed to non discrimination
9246727 zhang and his wife were on forced vacation for the past three weeks and were forced to stay at four different resort locations throughout their detention zhang and his wife were accompanied by 15 16 government officials including high ranking psb and rab leaders including the head of the rab of henan province
9246728 zhang and his wife were both excited and thankful to hear of the response from so many caring individuals despite the circumstances of his captivity pastor bike has been actively evangelizing and advocating the role of the house church to his captors since his detainment bike and his wife were told they were prohibited from returning to beijing until the end of the paralympics september 16
9246729 caa is thankful for the release of zhang and his wife and for the thousands of supporters who took time to sign the petition
9246730 while zhang and his wife have been treated well by chinese authorities during their detention the same can not be said of countless other individuals who continue to suffer at the hands of cpc officials who continue to prohibit the growth of true religious freedom within china
9246731 the real question is why did we get off this way why did you sanction me in the first place
9246732 youve engaged in supporting terrorists matter of fact you blew up 35 of the kids who went to my alma mater along with another hundred or so people youre a terrorist thats why
9246733 i express spiritual closeness and solidarity to the brothers and sisters in faith who are being so harshly tested
9246734 they are refugees now because they have left their homes they are living in the forests and they should be brought back
9246735 it is the responsibility of the government that these refugees should be brought back and also to send for force if necessary to stop this killing to stop this burning to stop this looting
9246736 it is reported that thousands of extremists have been brought from gujarat and chhattisgarh to perpetrate this violence which has spread to all the districts of orissa their agenda is to wipe out chrisitians and christianity from india starting from orissa
9246737 the christian community is saddened by the response of the government so far to tackle the situation in orissa that has become the boiling pot of crooked political agendas of the sangh parivar
9246738 influenced by the italian nationalist mazzini savarkar stresses the need to preserve the cultural purity of the hindu nation and resist the incursion of alien practices modern politicians have attempted to play down the racial and anti muslim aspects of hindutva stressing the inclusiveness of the indian identity but the term has fascist undertones
9246739 its nice to be important but its more important to be nice
9246740 there was no evidence that obamas mother shielded him from her berkeley seattle values
9246741 you know john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
9246742 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists
9246743 and today today as my call for a timeframe to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration even after we learned that iraq has 79 billion in surplus while we are wallowing in deficit john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
9246744 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time
9246745 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit cards bills you cant afford to pay and tuition thats beyond your reach these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9246746 household income rises poverty rate unchanged number of uninsured down
9246747 i will listen now i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
9246748 when the people find they can vote themselves money that will herald the end of the republic

9246754 i believe everything happens for a purpose in my own personal life if i dedicated back to my creator what im trying to create for the good everything will turn out fine
9246755 i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day
9246756 ive been so focused on state government i havent really focused much on the war in iraq
9246757 you cant work you have to stay home and care for your kid
9246758 i went home with my mates and had a few more beers i knew the consequences but i just wanted to get my mates home
9246759 there have been some horrific crashes recently and alcohol speed and fatigue have been common factors in the majority of the crashes
9246760 the results from this weekend show there are a percentage of drivers on our roads who show a total disregard for the safety of other road users
9246761 we got the victory and thats a great thing for georgia
9246762 if you had told me before the game what the outcome would be regardless of what the score would be i would have taken it i was pleased with the victory i am happy to win even though we made some mistakes but there were a lot of good things that happened too as coaches when things dont go the way we want we get bent out of shape but the victory is good well correct the mistakes and hopefully do a better job next week

9246784 theres quite a number of players offering different pieces of the stack
9246785 we saw a real competitive pricing environment out there and it looked like people are pushing stuff out the door
9246786 there are a couple of things behind that we suspect its mostly to get their footprint in the business to get pull through revenue like services but this makes us concerned for q3 we saw some steep declines for pricing especially in the u s
9246787 it used to be for megadatacenters people either built their own systems like google did or they went with rackable

9246800 je lui ai demand dadopter une approche constructive avec un vrai leadership parce quil y a des enjeux tr s importants maintenant
9246801 il est clair que jack layton na pas confiance dans la direction retenue par le gouvernement
9246802 on interpr te cette attitude de m dion comme une preuve quil ne veut pas parler au premier ministre
9246803 i think the fact we got so many combinations of players out there was the most important thing today we got a number of guys some playing time to see how they react when the lights come on
9246804 each game will get a little tougher so i dont know how much we could tell about today but i liked the way we started out we started out fast and the game kind of played out from there but again it just kind of is what it is an exhibition game in august
9246805 what did we hit 15 three pointers thats pretty good we have some more shooters thats for sure
9246806 it was good getting out there to try and teach these new guys our style of play we had a few practices under our belts but the game is where you can see how these guys react

9246942 while we have not been able to determine a root cause for these failures testing suggests a weak material die package combination system thermal management designs and customer use patters are contributing factors

9246964 ive been playing some gigs in l a and new york
9246965 itd have to be something very original and new for barack obama because his whole platform is change
9246966 the first thing i did was put in lawrence of arabia and listen to omar sharif
9246967 he was great he gave me a free seafood chowder the first time i stopped by and the second time he gave me a broccoli cheese soup
9246968 ive been training and i feel good i feel strong and healthy im motivated to continue my career i felt good about the way things worked out last year when i filled in for an injured kicker down in jacksonville then i finished the season with kansas city and things worked out well i felt confident if i continued to train and hope i would get some more opportunities here in 2008
9246969 when you go into your first game of the year and youre in the situation were in from the standpoint of our placekicker there isnt any question that in the back of your mind is the fact this is a veteran
9246970 thats really the number one thing john carney has so much experience and been in this league for so long kicked so many game winning field goals and been in so many tight situations its very difficult to overlook that part of it especially when youre week to week with your present kicker a guy thats kicked a 47 yarder to put you in the super bowl
9246971 theres no new news so progress is slow as it normally is
9246972 this is a phenomenal team that had a remarkable season last year
9246973 i was very proud to see the giants pull off the amazing victory in the super bowl and i feel honored and blessed to be here with the team right now
9246974 i know jeff is an excellent holder and ive watched jeff and played against jeff for many years
9246975 and i have a lot of confidence in jeff so it will be a few days of getting accustomed to and getting comfortable with the operation and the team i had a few opportunities to do that last year hopefully my system god willing will work and well be ready to go thursday night
9246976 when you look into the eyes of the players you see three or four different reactions
9246977 you have a lot of emotions and you have a lot of people that are anxious about this day you have some guys that come to the building here and it hasnt sunk in why theyre here so when they come up to you theyre in a state of shock its an anxious day for the player and its not a happy day for all of us here because youve had so many people that have played and tried so hard and theyre not going to be a part of our team thats the unfortunate nature of the process
9246978 because every group of young men is a new group
9246979 you become attached to them you find out what theyre made of you watch them practice and play and recognize the effort they give no two circumstances are ever the same with regard to releasing the players
9246980 as always we try to keep the best 53 football players
9246981 i like this squad a lot number one we have talented players number two i believe theyre focused and still hungry with something to prove
9246982 obviously its a calculated risk we studied all the numbers theres a 90 percent assurance you never get beyond the one backup quarterback the thing about it is with our kicker situation at this point in time we felt like we needed to be able to protect some players and still be able to do the things necessary from the standpoint of placekickers
9246983 theyre veteran players and theyve seen an awful lot in this game and theyve been able to react to it each individual is different
9246984 from the standpoint of reuben we have a pretty good group of guys at running back and felt like they were all worthy of making an nfl team and they have so many roles that they can play reuben can be a fullback he can be a running back he can be a special teams player he can be a short yardage and goal line guy he has a lot of hats he can wear
9246985 i think most of the time if you go back and look the roster turnover is in that area around 25 percent
9246986 there is always change in some way shape or form the other thing is youre always in a position where youre trying to develop your young guys to come along thats always a factor youre counting on the veteran experience from the offensive side of the ball and hoping the new guys can become integrated as fast as possible to the sophistication to the in season play you just hope people can come together as fast as possible to make the kind of plays that are necessary to win
9246987 i chose oscar straus because he was the best man for the job
9246988 raids rights and rainbow coalitions gay and lesbian citizenship and the remaking of chicago politics 1950 2000
9246989 ive seen levels of compliance with the civil rights bill and changes that have been most surprising
9246990 so on the basis of this i think we may be able to get a negro president in less than 40 years i would think that this could come in 25 years or less
9246991 when people ask you what youre going to be when you grow up tell them youre going to be the first negro president of the united states
9246992 worked up the courage to say it a few times
9246993 some 50 years ago a president of the u s came close to being impeached because he invited a negro to a white house breakfast today appointment of a negro to the presidents cabinet met only a slight delaying action
9246994 every democrat who has sought the presidency has attempted to update the legacy of fdrs new deal
9246995 a new post new deal liberalism that was moving the country beyond reaganite conservatism
9246996 obama resembles jimmy carter more than he does any other democratic president in living memory
9246997 who lost the large industrial states in the primaries deal with a troubled economy
9246998 become the master of congress and enact goals such as universal health care
9246999 tribune of sweeping change and yet he also proclaims national unity as if transformation can come without struggle
9247000 presents himself as an advocate of bipartisanship and ideological flexibility

9247225 well i just thought it would be cool you know
9247226 its not navy but its not exactly sky blue either its like regular blue just a little darker
9247227 okay ill have it through the front of my hair
9247228 alright just wait for it to dry while i do his
9247229 just a single streak through my bangs but not all of my bangs just like a mini streak would work
9247230 do you want it do go all the way from the swirl at the back of your head until the end of your bangs
9247231 sure that would work towards the back could it be small and then as it comes to my bangs it could gradually get bigger
9247232 no i know it sounds like the kind you buy at hot topic but i swear its permanent thats why i had to be extra careful its this new formula thats easier to use in the salon
9247233 i like it a lot im actually glad you talked me into it
9247234 the bishop is in very good health hes in good condition today and responded well to surgery
9247235 i had my modest goal and i had my secret dream
9247236 my modest goal was that it would become a tool within new hampshire to talk about inclusion in a more informed and innovative way my secret goal was that it would serve that purpose nationally and internationally and would cross over to the mainstream
9247237 theres a huge disabled population there and all of them are pretty much undervalued
9247238 theres not an understanding that people with disabilities can be part of the society in iraq and hopefully this film will support change
9247239 its a great resource and we are so lacking in resources in arabic
9247240 its introducing a model of inclusion that hasnt been seen in iraq
9247241 in some ways it all boils down to something thats very selfish i want the world to be a better place for samuel
9247242 its very simple but its kind of the heart of everything im doing
9247243 samuel thinks a lot more about the patriots the red sox earthquakes volcanoes and his friends than he thinks about this film which is totally the way it should be same goes for isaiah
9247244 but that said they have a sense of the impact its having they both have some pride in the fact that their words their lives are having an impact on people all over the country and the world
9247245 i asked myself what would my dream be professionally and it would be to really make the most of this film for at least a year after its premiere and then keep making documentary films about disability issues so i pitched that to the institute
9247246 i think we sometimes miss the larger population of our audience when were conducting outreach because were viewed as too academic not totally accessible what dans film does is open up that message to everyone
9247247 for their substantive efforts to extend the boundaries of the human experience to children of all abilities in keeping with the foundations mission of supporting communities with inclusive programs and creating awareness about the possibilities that inclusion can bring
9247248 i really want every school to be welcoming to all kids
9247249 and i think thats what the film is doing allowing people to have that conversation

9247252 john mccain intervened personally to get those votes changed because the plan the convention rules committee was working on was not as favorable to new hampshire
9247253 i love her record as a reformer and someone who has challenged the establishment in alaska
9247254 she underscores the idea that voters are going to get change with a mccain administration as well shes as much of a washington outsider as you can get
9247255 thats exactly what the republican party needs to have someone prepared to stand up to people like don young whose actions are why my party is in the minority
9247256 her contribution is in shaking things up which is just what john mccain wants to do in alaska which is essentially a one party state she took on the republican establishment shes not afraid to break some china if shes going to redo the kitchen
9247257 the criticism youve heard the longest is mccain would be four more years of the bush administration
9247258 a chance to talk directly to the nation about what that candidate wants to do
9247259 im excited because i think washington is broken and im looking forward to hear sen mccain say how he will bring real and much needed reform to washington
9247260 his pick of sarah palin really amplifies that he really wants to shake up washington
9247261 provides sen mccain the opportunity to show the nation not only the issues that are important to him but also the individuals who he will surround himself with as president
9247262 we dont have any dependence on foreign fuel in this house
9247263 were seeing an increase in the amount of people interested
9247264 a specialty item not every mason would be able to build one
9247265 buy yourself a wood stove its going to be cheaper
9247266 i would not be surprised to see 400 a cord by the end of the heating season at the end of march and april
9247267 ive noticed a lot more firewood in peoples yards this year than i ever noticed last year
9247268 we always recommend that people buy their wood a year before they actually want to use it
9247269 the problem with a traditional fireplace is the room that youre in is warmer but youre actually drawing heat out of the remainder of the house and the heat is going up the chimney
9247270 that movie is kind of how she considers herself she is one of the people she rose up from being a small town mayor and tries to be inclusive
9247271 shes pretty easy to approach an open minded person who is willing to listen to all angles
9247272 shes met my family numerous times and always asks about my kids
9247273 from a political standpoint she was able to pull that off with a pretty big effort on her part where she used a lot of her political capital
9247274 palins popularity among voters kind of sticks in the craw of a few of them even republicans her going against the establishment does not help either
9247275 if you want to see the future imagine someones boot stamping on the human face forever
9247276 get out of town this is not the one to play with
9247277 how many times can i say im not sorry and how many ways can i show i dont care
9247278 if you want to see the future imagine someones boot stamping on the human face forever
9247279 the investigation is ongoing and were not going to be releasing any details about the investigation at this time
9247280 giving the name of the victim is the only thing were going to be giving right now
9247281 they just said some guy got beaten up down the street and theyre looking for two guys from massachusetts
9247282 they seemed in love but we never got real close with her she only worked with us about a year
9247283 if you want to see the future imagine someones boot stamping on the human face forever
9247284 if you look at whats going on theres a lot of things for people to be bummed out or depressed with
9247285 theres so many good things that get overshadowed by the negative things going on
9247286 a lot of times we can get caught up on whats going on in the world step back and realize we have a great quality of life up here in new hampshire and embrace it
9247287 when you grow up in new hampshire i was sort of a young go getter i wanted to conquer the world and be on wall street and live that lifestyle
9247288 for the last 15 years ive tried to come back to the state
9247289 to me i dont think thats the story it takes a lot to produce a magazine and distribute it throughout the state to 70 000 people every month
9247290 someone within a few minutes can feel something positive about this state
9247291 a lot of people certainly move to new hampshire because of its natural beauty and history and heritage and hes recognized it
9247292 i think he sees a real opportunity to give back to the state
9247293 one of the things they used the troubadour for was to stimulate interest in second homes in the 30s and 40s
9247294 city streets have little in them that releases our affection
9247295 back roads are the pathway to nostalgic memories and sometimes to adventure in new hampshire
9247296 theres so many stories to tell theres so many anecdotes so much history and tradition you can find
9247297 every time i look at them they are the new hampshire of our memories
9247298 the troubadour is when there was no interstate 93 or 89
9247299 what we create in the first issue is probably not what were going to have in issues to come
9247300 i think i never rule anything out quite frankly im focused on building businesses and giving back to the state that has given me so much
9247301 oll right dis is too easy dere is none of em behind us and only twenty thousand or so in front

9247316 this is a good sign that relationships are improving in baghdad when local residents feel comfortable enough to approach iraqi police and coalition forces and provide this type of information to our security forces
9247317 this is a sign that residents are ready to work and trust the ip as they improve in their capability and begin to take over as the primary force in protecting and serving their citizens
9247318 cprs one of the most important classes its the basis of the medical field
9247319 its kind of hard with the language barrier but its easier touching somebody knowing i have to push here so i can find a pulse
9247320 when i first started i asked some of them how do you check a pulse some of them went straight to the place
9247321 at the end they seemed to be doing it on their own they were managing to open the airways
9247322 we asked them how many chest compressions do you do between breaths
9247323 they actually got to learn it and understand it they seemed to understand everything we put out they answered all of our questions
9247324 they need to continually retrain and retrain they need to do classes by themselves and teach other people how cpr is done the more they do it the more accustomed they are to it
9247325 if no one is around and i see someone who doesnt know how to swim i will help him
9247326 the primary purpose of the sois is to provide additional security to the area living on the fob we can only get out to patrol the area so much
9247327 the sois occupy their checkpoints 24 hours a day which increases security in the area we lean on the sois as much as possible to complete tasks that would normally take up cf combat power
9247328 they are doing good things out there they are very important
9247329 it cuts down our patrol times and they know the area
9247330 these sois know everyone in the area so they know when someone is here who doesnt belong
9247331 they also are better than us at spotting when something doesnt look right and needs a second look
9247332 the local sois are all from our ao and most are from families that have lived here for a long time our area has always been fairly safe but the sois are able to work 24 hours a day and deter the enemy from using our ao as a transit place when coalition forces are not patrolling
9247333 their impact on the security of the ao was immediate and pleasantly surprising
9247334 whenever possible we will involve the sois with us during our operations to reduce the strain that our operations have the potential to cause on the local nationals
9247335 iraqis are a lot happier to have other iraqis searching through their belongings than a big american soldier who doesnt speak their language and may not be totally aware of cultural customs rules and courtesies bottom line involving the sois in our operations is a way to get the job done and lessen the cultural impact of our soldiers on the daily lives of the people living and working in the ao
9247336 everyone is extremely happy with the sois they have increased security in the area and also provided the young men in the area a way to make money for themselves and the family
9247337 it is not a lot but every job helps the community in some way they are also happy that it is local men who are working the checkpoints
9247338 our ultimate goal is to eventually transform the sois into a government of iraq isf element
9247339 these packets will be turned into the iraqi police department so they can be vetted through the iraq channels and eventually hopefully around the first of the year the sois can report to training and be picked up as iraqi police officers and return in an official goi paid position to police the area
9247340 we were making sure they had a full range of motion and were physically fit to accomplish their job
9247341 what we see with most iraqi civilians is dental problems and high blood pressure from smoking
9247342 we still conduct training with them but spend the majority of the time conducting joint tcps and dismounted patrols with them
9247343 we have found that they are very eager to learn and serve their community they are always motivated and willing to work with the patrols in the ao
9247344 look at that girl enjoy that face full of celebration
9247345 look at that girl enjoy that face full of celebration
9247346 girl you are tiiiiiiiiiiiny but you cant hide those guns
9247347 how many times can i say im not sorry and how many ways can i show i dont care
9247348 the mind is the limit as long as the mind can envision the fact that you can do something you can do it as location gresham oregon united states age 20 stats 510
9247349 it is critically important that the public have confidence in the integrity of the legislative process
9247350 look at that girl enjoy that face full of celebration
9247351 if you cant change others change yourself if you cant change yourself kill yourself if you cant kill yourself kill others
9247352 bill gardner told me so long as i didnt register to vote there that i was good based on my conversation with bill its clear for me to run
9247353 my vehicle has been registered here my drivers license has been here the whole time ive voted only here
9247354 i just dont want to play that kind of politics
9247355 it will help reduce errors speed up the process and eventually reduce personnel costs
9247356 the run of the mill offense wouldnt be in there
9247357 now you could have littleton police looking for a guy but they cant find him because hes in jail in rockingham county or a guy is in there and nobody knows hes under a detainer order from berlin
9247358 no judge wants be on the front page of the paper having allowed lowered bail on a defendant only to learn hes been rearrested and no one knew none of us want that
9247359 it has the potential to impair the open police investigation
9247360 oftentimes they respond in desperation in july and august when they get the bills
9247361 consumers should be informed and they should make good decisions
9247362 most people pay generally some combination of the three over four years
9247363 there is a misconception amongst consumers that they are going to go to college and get a ton of financial aid
9247364 most of it is loans and most institutions dont fund the full cost of tuition even with loans so the parents have to come up with more money or borrow more money
9247365 unfortunately because of the credit crunch the failure of auction rate securities some states dont have the liquidity and a lot of states have stopped issuing loans until such time as the credit market levels out out of desperation families are reaching out at this late date
9247366 families or students are charging with credit cards or taking these very high variable rate loans which in the long run will cost them money some as a high as 14 percent plus they are reset every year
9247367 the worst thing is a lot students do that pay tuition on a credit card
9247368 for the student to do that its an immediate fix but more importantly it hurts their credit status
9247369 new hampshire has a very good section 529 plan tax advantaged with the federal government
9247370 the bottom line is for families facing college they need to be good consumers seek out government loans and non profit loan programs and third if they need to borrow from private sources like a sallie mae or bank loans they need to not take the first one that comes across the desk but rather to look at the terms and be smart consumers
9247371 might have been one of those young people who wanted to get lost
9247372 whoever turns up that day gets to be in the film
9247373 fill the moat with the corpses of your comrades trample on their broken carcasses to reach the ramparts bring down the walls with the weight of the dead
9247374 i will not raise taxes on the people of california
9247375 look i cut to the chase i know what the democrats like and i know what the republicans like so i say lets meet somewhere in the middle
9247376 because of the increasing public interest in educational accountability aggregate test data continue to be widely publicized and analyzed
9247377 aggregate scores can be properly used as one indicator of educational quality when used in conjunction with a careful examination of other conditions however not all students in a high school district or state take the sat since the population of test takers is self selected using aggregate sat scores to compare or evaluate teachers schools districts states or other educational units is not valid and the college board strongly discourages such uses
9247378 the circumstances surrounding the entry into the camper including the process by which the decision to enter was made and the tactics used throughout the incident warrant further review
9247379 somebody tapped me on the shoulder and told me it was a single game record thats good thats progress thats our program just keeping at it
9247380 with his speed and quickness hes the type of guy who can change games his athleticism is just off the charts
9247381 he looks like he should be playing pee wee football but he can play with the big boys
9247382 i know the coaches wanted us to go out there and execute the offense and not make a lot of mistakes we just tried to move the ball and move the chains
9247383 i thought we played great against the run we stopped the pass pretty well i liked the way our defense performed
9247384 we got a win which is the most important thing but i think we have room for improvement
9247385 in the first game you find out a little bit about your team whos in the right spots and where you need to tweak things so this will be good tape for us to study tomorrow well find where we fall short and where we are strong and continue to build in those areas
9247386 the states that bush won in the last election held lower a mean intelligence quotient over the ones kerry won based on average sat amp act scores
9247387 the states that bush won in the last election held lower a mean intelligence quotient over the ones kerry won based on average sat amp act scores
9247388 do we really need stats when the partys base believes in adam and eve literally
9247389 in the past two days we have seen numerous instances of police harassment and arrest of bushville campers on harriett island independent journalists and now the arrest on false pretenses of activists who have worked for over two years in the open to provide support for public dissent this week
9247390 were seeking sanctuary to call attention to the illegal tactics police violence harassment and mass arrests of the ramsey county sheriff who has ordered the politically motivated arrests of dedicated community activists on false pretenses to make it more difficult for ordinary people to express their dissent
9247391 were calling on mayor coleman chief harrington and other st paul councilmembers to join councilmember david thune in denouncing and calling for an end to the illegal tactics of sheriff bob fletcher and to affirm that the important work of creating supportive environments for dissent by all people that is the mission of the welcoming committee continue
9247392 theres a very long tradition of quakers giving protection to persecuted people so im completely in favor of my meeting giving sanctuary to those who are currently being persecuted by the ramsey county sheriffs office
9247393 ive always viewed the sheriff and the local police as people who are here to protect us and our civil rights
9247394 overall the event is going smoothly with no major problems
9247395 medical cases are very consistent with last year with daily patient loads of 0 5 to 0 7 percent of the population
9247396 if you want to see the future imagine someones boot stamping on the human face forever
9247397 do i think we can turn it around i absolutely think we can
9247398 we want the operation to be financially solvent if not profitable
9247399 wed like to have the opportunity to make mcintyre work for everybody
9247400 we just owe it to ourselves to look at that option
9247401 the only reason im hedging is because i dont want to say something thats not 100 percent accurate
9247402 i just thought it was interesting the two possible candidates for governor in 2010 are going to be there
9247403 the animals dont like that they wont use it as a litter box
9247404 i dont think its going to be a lot of fun
9247405 i grew up with him playing the saxophone to louis armstrong every night as i was going to bed theres love there
9247406 oh geez yeah there were doubts for sure i think everyone goes through low points in their career i was pretty down and out before i got traded
9247407 i couldnt really get anyone out it truly becomes a mental game i was getting a little bit scared of contact they werent pitching me and i was miserable not playing and not doing well
9247408 once you get past the physical aspect of playing at triple a or the big leagues it becomes mostly mental its about how you approach the game and throwing strikes i wasnt really doing that last year
9247409 i came here and they gave me an opportunity to start they helped me out with some mechanical things and just let me be who i was thats just going out there to win games and getting people out any way you can
9247410 i wish the results were better but at least i got out there and got the first one over with the next one can be better
9247411 i never really thought about my career being over but careers dont last forever you know im glad i made it hopefully from now on i can get better and stay up there
9247412 he said thank you to me i told him he was the one putting in all the hard work but it was still nice to hear him say that
9247413 how about that baptism by fire playing at yankee stadium
9247414 er hat schon unterschrieben es sind nur noch ein paar details zu kl ren
9247415 wir haben nach einer stunde das spielen eingestellt und um den ausgleichstreffer f rmlich gebettelt
9247416 wir haben uns in dieses match wieder richtig hineingek mpft
9247417 das war ein ganz wichtiger punkt bei einem meisterschaftskandidaten wir sind daf r belohnt worden dass wir immer an uns geglaubt haben
9247418 wir haben uns von nichts umwerfen lassen so will ich meine mannschaft immer sehen
9247419 the vp candidate who appeals to women with his authorship and championing of landmark domestic violence legislation support for pay equity and advocacy for women around the world
9247420 wir haben das gl ck dass die spieler hochtalentiert sind und wir ihnen nicht erst das fu ballspielen beibringen mussten
9247421 j rgen klopp bringt uns freude und motiviert uns au erdem verstehen wir uns auch au erhalb des platzes sehr gut
9247422 es steht jetzt 2 0 f r ihn da muss ich nachziehen
9247423 die fans haben bereits geschrien wir wollen den derby sieg diesen wunsch wollen wir ihnen erf llen
9247424 ich bin ein gro er fan der art und weise wie sie fu ball spielen wie sie letzte saison den abstieg verhindert haben das war weltklasse
9247425 wir sind zuvor nicht in euphorie verfallen und jetzt werden wir nicht in depressionen verfallen
9247426 aber f nf tore klingen viel zu hart wir haben teilweise richtig gut fu ball gespielt
9247427 wir waren insgesamt zu naiv und ich hoffe dass wir schnell lernen wie hart fehler in der bundesliga bestraft werden
9247428 wenn wir das n chste spiel gegen wehen wiesbaden gewinnen k nnen wir von einem richtig guten saisonstart reden
9247429 in anbetracht des schweren startprogramms sind sechs punkte aus den ersten sechs spielen f r uns kein beinbruch
9247430 ich bin grunds tzlich optimistisch wir haben eine eingespielte mannschaft aus der vergangenen spielzeit und deshalb in jedem spiel gute chancen zu gewinnen
9247431 sie suchen ihr heil in der offensive stehen im zentrum stabil und verf gen ber eine grundsolide spieler ffnung
9247432 police were taking mattress pads and other items out of the garage
9247433 a criminal enterprise intent on criminal acts before and after the republican national convention
9247434 said one spokeswoman to the crowd of mostly young people at powderhorn
9247435 but we also have our power to act and we call on the community to stand with us and condemn these actions we will not be stopped by these raids we will be in the streets on monday
9247436 you have nothing to fear from the police as long as you engage in no dissent stay home watch tv be a cheering delegate above all play your assigned role and submit to the state
9247437 it is never a predicament on my part because in the first place i dont think that it will prosper
9247438 dont land dont try to help us its too dangerous for you
9247439 twice in the past three years red hooks only full service grocery store closed forcing residents to walk three miles and cross an eight lane road or take a 10 cab if they want to shop there
9247440 i think youre right because you know when i went to poland everyone was really was so happy that i was there so so many big fans i thought maybe my last my name was williams owski or something
9247441 actually i learned how to play against her shes very tough player like a wall everything is going back
9247442 but i definitely think that its a matter of another few months and then another player or couple of players are going to raise to the number 1 ranking and really stay there for a while
9247443 yeah a couple times in my career not too many
9247444 collecting 35 for your credit reports and auss will allow me to come up with the best solution for your situation
9247445 you better watch that if the client signs and rescinds then it is your legal responsibility to reimburse them for the cost of the appraisal
9247446 fuel raises the bar in terms of scale and exhilaration for racing games we begin with the largest racing environment to appear in gaming ever with our accelerated effects of climate change and dynamic weather system we add an extra dimension that change races on the fly and constantly presents new challenges to players
9247447 player choice lies at the heart of fuels action packed races and with a huge range of vehicles packs of up to 16 vehicles speeding across diverse terrain and a no boundaries no limits approach to racing means players have never had so much freedom to conquer the wilderness and take the chequered flag
9247448 the technology asobo studios has developed to build fuel is ground breaking to create a game on this unprecedented scale to this level of graphical quality complete with all the dynamic weather effects is a great achievement
9247449 fuel had to be a special title for codemasters to include in our racing portfolio and we believe that from both a gameplay and a technical perspective fuel compliments our long standing tradition of driving excellence
9247450 we are going to continue to fight until they are both free
9247451 theyve been in prison much too long and they should be released it makes me think about how much we are haunted by our own history
9247452 it is important for people to understand the way in which two men could basically be framed up and kept in prison for 36 years even though theyre innocent
9247453 i love pogo ive been playing on pogo com for about a good 4 years now i just now got my friends to join pogo as well and they love it i am 24 years old i have 3 daughters now

9247514 i am sure many are aware that raja petra is for the time being hosting the site elsewhere it is quite bemusing that skmm should have thought the blocking of access to malaysia today would actually succeed internet censorship may not only be unnecessary it is quite often impossible especially when the targeted site is for better or worse one of the most popular across the country

9247554 i have no one on my left and few on my right i will hold
9247555 i am confident and believe that all the trials we are facing today can be overcome if we remain united and work together with firm determination
9247556 we have not only successfully faced these obstacles but have gone beyond that we have successfully developed this country to a level which we can all be proud of
9247557 no one citizen is recognised as being of a higher position than another in this nation this nation belongs to all of us whether we rise or fall as a nation depends on all of us
9247558 we will continue to tackle the problem of higher prices of goods and inflation as best we can the government is always sensitive to the burden that has to be borne by the people particularly the poor and low income group as well as the needy

9247605 i thought we played well in that second half our effort was just much better
9247606 it starts with defense and we made a real effort to get it done on the defensive end i especially thought our guys down low were the key in that second half they crashed the boards and that led to easy baskets
9247607 the first half was just a feeling out process for us but we played much better in the second half
9247608 we were more aggressive coming out of the lockerroom and we finished plays that we were not taking advantage of in the first half our focus was taking it inside and hitting the offensive glass and that is the main reason we were able to pull away

9247617 reconocemos que las tradiciones suelen ser m s fuerte que la ley y la acci n legal por s sola no es suficiente
9247618 el cambio debe venir tambi n desde dentro esta es la raz n por la que es fundamental para nosotros unirnos y trabajar estrechamente con las comunidades y sus dirigentes para que puedan lograr el cambio social sostenible

9247647 this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day that im not sure weve seen anything like it

9247686 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
9247687 god puts me through hell so i could make it to heaven
9247688 yes its confirmed we are going to mississippi in the morning campaign spokeswoman kimmie lipscomb told afp after mccain flew into midwestern missouri for an overnight stop
9247689 they need to know that theyre in our thoughts and prayers as this impending hurricane approaches
9247690 we pray to god that it will spare them and a minimum of loss that might result from this natural disaster
9247691 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a national disaster
9247692 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers he said
9247693 ive instructed my senate staff to monitor the situation closely
9247694 you know obviously were going to be each day seeing what happens and were praying for new orleans but we want to make sure that people are making all the necessary precautions
9247695 i decree today that life is simply taking and not giving england is mine and it owes me a living
9247696 god puts me through hell so i could make it to heaven
9247697 youre not going to beat a good team when you make the mistakes we made
9247698 i havent even thought about the record and im not going to i can only say it so many times its not a big deal to me i just cant seem to get that across
9247699 im back to 100 percent i feel good and were ready to start preparing for ohio state
9247700 knowing we have these two weeks to prepare means a lot too
9247701 unfortunately were going to have some growing pains i was hoping we wouldnt have too many but this was the first game for them and i think theyll get better each game
9247702 i was very proud of the way the guys hung in there
9247703 futebol assim um dia a torcida ap ia em outro dia ela critica o ronaldinho ga cho era her i e hoje pegam no p dele
9247704 faltou um pouco de ritmo de jogo n o deu tempo de recuperar tudo agora trabalhar forte para voltar a jogar bem na pr xima partida
9247705 enquanto estava bem eu era cara no botafogo mas como diz aquele ditado chupam a fruta toda e jogam o baga o fora enquanto tentamos realizar o nosso trabalho com profissionalismo existem algumas pessoas ligadas ao futebol que s o verdadeiros palha os e acham que podem fazer o que quiserem
9247706 o miranda o melhor do pa s na posi o infelizmente ele teve uma contus o que o parou por um tempo mas est recuperado da parte cl nica e s falta pegar o ritmo de jogo que s retoma jogando com certeza disparado o melhor do pa s na posi o
9247707 o kl ber um grande jogador e est em excelente fase temos de par lo e n o deixar a bola chegar para ele precisamos de cuidado e manter a aten o at quando ele estiver sem a bola temos de ficar em cima dele
9247708 em 2004 quando eu estava no coritiba marquei um gol no rog rio como um presente de anivers rio para minha esposa agora revejo o ceni novamente v spera do anivers rio da roberta uma coincid ncia que s deus pode explicar
9247709 tenho o elenco todo para o jogo e o grupo me recebeu bem todos est o se esfor ando muito e sabem que precisamos do resultado positivo para subir na tabela
9247710 um momento em que a gente evita sair n o tem nem como ir jantar com a fam lia a gente fica com medo corre um pouco de risco
9247711 a gente depende s da gente para mudar esta fase tomara que comece j domingo com uma seq ncia de vit rias
9247712 os volantes apareceram no ataque os laterais apareceram no ataque at o come o desta rodada nossa equipe era a segunda ou terceira menos vazada a equipe n o perdeu por jogar ofensivamente
9247713 o que eu passo para nosso torcedor o que eu passei para nossos jogadores em campo n s perdemos pronto o campeonato brasileiro n o permite que voc fique muito tempo comemorando uma vit ria ou lamentando uma derrota
9247714 viemos em busca dos tr s pontos para sair da lanterna do campeonato que o que nos interessa l gico que o empate n o foi ruim conquistamos um ponto importante mas nosso objetivo era a vit ria
9247715 eu n o sou trouxa s o 20 anos como treinador nos quais eu aprendi alguma coisa aprendi a ser mais frio eu era at empolgado queria que meu time fizesse cinco gols fosse para dentro como eu j trabalhei com time com at tr s volantes eu trabalho com aquilo que n s temos e n o posso chegar no goi s e exigir um monte
9247716 o futebol muito pr tico e n s temos um time comum outros times comuns est o crescendo ent o a realidade essa mas eu fiquei muito satisfeito porque tivemos a oportunidade de mostrar nossa for a apesar dos desfalques
9247717 estamos fazendo bem feito e n o pensem que me agrada ver o goi s disputando o campeonato para n o ficar na zona de rebaixamento mas n o posso viver fora da realidade se for assim vamos para o ltimo jogo contra o s o paulo naquele desespero tendo que fazer mil e uma loucuras
9247718 o dorival conhece o time e vai querer surpreender eles vir o aqui para conseguir pontos sem se defender tanto acho que v o jogar de igual para igual para conseguir a vit ria
9247719 o coritiba vem bem vem com o mesmo treinador ali s dos dez primeiros colocados sete t m a perman ncia e nestes sete cinco ganharam t tulos
9247720 o cruzeiro tem bons jogadores de bastante velocidade que podem incomodar mas do outro lado a gente sabe que temos jogadores que tamb m preocupam eles um advers rio que luta diretamente por um vaga na libertadores
9247721 estou muito feliz e n o sei nem o que falar diante de tudo isso
9247722 quero vir competir nessa nova pista de s o carlos e espero que possa um dia ajudar a preparar novos campe es aqui
9247723 today i served very well i have more confidence and i hope to continue to improve my tennis i know i have to keep improving my tennis if i want to win
9247724 i was playing great and he was playing great too
9247725 i really didnt get any rhythm i just kept fighting this is why you put in all the work hopefully i can keep it going
9247726 that gave me a lot of confidence that i could win
9247727 he was playing well in that moment but after that i started playing better and he made some mistakes
9247728 ive gotten a lot better since then he has too
9247729 i can go out there and rip away i have nothing to lose
9247730 i had to play my game serve huge and that served me well
9247731 im definitely not at my best but i hope to get there
9247732 given the increased persecution before and even during the olympic games in spite of international attention we can only expect persecution to increase in severity in the year following the olympic games
9247733 ini berbeda dengan 2004 kita di luar sehingga lebih mudah untuk membuat strategi
9247734 selama ini program pemerintah yang berhasil gagal dikomunikasikan sehingga imbasnya juga pada golkar ini perlu dibangun bukan hanya oleh jk tapi juga oleh sby sebagai satu kesatuan pemerintah
9247735 kalau menjelang 2004 kita menghidupkan mesin partai dan membangun semangat kader dengan konvensi 2009 kita memberikan sebuah terobosan dengan suara terbanyak ini demi keadilan agar semua kader merasakan kerja keras dan jerih payahnya tidak bisa hanya dengan ongkang ongkang kaki di nomor 1
9247736 dalam kondisi seperti ini berarti bilangan syaban digenapkan 30 hari sesuai hadits nabi yang berbunyi
9247737 bulan ramadan kali ini kami mengangkat infaq dan shadaqoh sebagai gaya hidup nanti setelah launching ada rampag bedug ada 20 bedug dan kemudian akan diiringi 42 marawis
9247738 kalau 0 025 ini dikalikan 100 menjadi zakat zakat sebanyak 2 5
9247739 n o tem como explicar fui aben oado podia ter sido com qualquer um mas foi comigo estou feliz
9247740 o fluminense uma grande equipe e mostrou isso quase sendo campe o da libertadores neste ano temos que nos concentrar muito na partida se quisermos vencer
9247741 primeiro temos que pensar em entrar no grupo da libertadores para depois pensarmos no t tulo indo um passo de cada vez certamente podemos terminar muito bem o campeonato
9247742 temos que encarar com o m ximo de aten o pois um cl ssico que pode nos colocar novamente no grupo de classifica o para a libertadores a sim depois poderemos ficar mais perto do gr mio mas o fluminense tamb m precisa muito da vit ria e precisamos estar atentos
9247743 realmente o fato de conhecer a maneira como o flamengo joga me ajudar bastante a orientar o time antes e durante a partida sei que quando dirigia o botafogo o t cnico do flamengo era o joel santana mas o caio j nior por ser um profissional muito competente manteve aquilo que vinha dando certo e o nosso advers rio mudou muito pouco tendo um estilo definido
9247744 vencer um cl ssico muda qualquer astral e aumenta a confian a do grupo principalmente porque o flamengo vem passando uma grande fase o fluminense tem como meta brigar pelo t tulo do segundo turno do campeonato brasileiro e para isso vamos precisar ter uma boa pontua o nos cl ssicos
9247745 futebol assim um dia a torcida ap ia em outro dia ela critica o ronaldinho ga cho era her i e hoje pegam no p dele
9247746 faltou um pouco de ritmo de jogo n o deu tempo de recuperar tudo agora trabalhar forte para voltar a jogar bem na pr xima partida
9247747 tenho o elenco todo para o jogo e o grupo me recebeu bem todos est o se esfor ando muito e sabem que precisamos do resultado positivo para subir na tabela
9247748 um momento em que a gente evita sair n o tem nem como ir jantar com a fam lia a gente fica com medo corre um pouco de risco
9247749 a gente depende s da gente para mudar esta fase tomara que comece j domingo com uma seq ncia de vit rias
9247750 vai ser uma press o muito grande da torcida e eles v o buscar os gols nos primeiros minutos como todos os times que jogam em casa mas n s precisamos vencer e vamos jogar o tempo todo para isso os tabus existem para serem quebrados
9247751 nossa equipe n o tem trazido bons resultados fora de casa mas temos que aproveitar que eles n o passam por um bom momento temos que trazer esse bom resultado
9247752 n s deixamos para tr s pontos que agora est o nos fazendo falta mas agora somar tr s pontos sempre e encarar todos os jogos como decis o
9247753 a vit ria nos enche de moral ficamos satisfeitos e com mais confian a j que temos um jogo muito dif cil contra o palmeiras pelo brasileiro
9247754 a torcida com certeza vai lotar a arena no domingo para nos apoiar a equipe ganhou confian a e a torcida tamb m esperamos agora retribuir e conquistar os tr s pontos
9247755 qualquer jogo contra o wanderley luxemburgo voc tem que respeitar qualquer m xima quando enfrenta o wanderley n o vale sou pr ximo a ele e acho que vai ser um jogo dific limo nunca ganhei do wanderley talvez esse seja a grande oportunidade

9247761 o vasco n o precisar procurar um lateral esquerdo a camisa seis j minha tenho nove jogos como titular e ningu m vai tir la de mim

9247763 we dont know what happened we dont know anything about thai politics
9247764 they keep telling us we are on standby but they are still not sure if our flight can take off
9247765 the current political stand off will absolutely have an adverse effect on our tourism industry but the extent of the damage will depend on how long the turmoil lasts
9247766 if anything the security situation with these coups is nothing new in thailand
9247767 its taken as fact if you look at their history they have coups every couple of years
9247768 here its generally not violent and generally its looked at as a domestic issue

9247796 put on the new man which after god that is after the image of god is created
9247797 the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus
9247798 i will give you pastors according to mine heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding
9247799 they are desperate because of defeats along the northern front lines and are targeting civilians
9247800 there was big sound and people screamed and ran in all directions i saw several people covered with blood lying on the ground
9247801 god puts me through hell so i could make it to heaven
9247802 there are no such things as liberators the people liberate themselves
9247803 at the end of the day you cant say sh
9247804 god puts me through hell so i could make it to heaven
9247805 hey there nymphobraniac im having such a bitchin week you wont believe it but
9247806 sorry but i dont have time for the past right now man im on the way to the office and im late already
9247807 woo an office how lame dude you should work from home
9247808 if stuffing envelopes would pay my rent id totally go for that
9247809 thats not the kind of stuffing i was thinking of baby you should be a whore
9247810 a whore prostitute oh wait yeah i guess youd prefer escort its the easiest thing in the world if youre in the right location and if youre not you can just move
9247811 im sure im going to regret this but go ahead and tell me where exactly is the right location
9247812 no doubt about it the upper east side its probably has the most in call escorts per capita in the city shit maybe the most in the world
9247813 are you sure about this prostitution just seems so very downtown or at least more west side than east
9247814 dont trust me man check out transportation infrastructure and socioeconomic demographics funkybutt for the rougher and hotter tricks from long island queens and bronx the upper east is conveniently located between the queensboro and the triboro add to that all of the frustrated married men with their frigid plastic ues bizarro wives its totally where the closet freaks are the ones with money anyway
9247815 if you had a resourceful bone in your body youd probably fracture it see theres this one broker in the mid 50s that all the prosties use especially the trannies hes totally on your side and wont try to scam you just likes the concept of prostitution you know
9247816 about having all these guys coming in the apartment it seems kind of dangerous
9247817 heh coming in the apartment i love you sometimes no thats why you have to do a little scouting of your location that broker he found my friend tia a great place on york and 74th it has all the key features that you need first off it faces the street
9247818 well thats a bonus but the real reason is so you can inspect the clientele see a doorman would inevitably catch on and either cause trouble or want some of the action so you dont want a building with a door jockey out front and not only do you want to face the street but you need have a view of a nearby phone booth even better if the phone booth is across the street from you when your client calls for an appointment you dont give out your address you direct them to the phone booth so you can give them a look see before you let them up
9247819 nevermind but i get it an apartment that faces the street so i can filter the freaks but i dont think i can afford this its not like i could have a roommate if im going to do this and rent is so expensive near there its like two blocks from sothebys
9247820 its not like you wont be working think about it if you charge 100 for a session you could easily afford your rent by just doing nine tricks a month hell tia got a two bedroom to keep the sex in one room and real life in the other bedroom at most thats what fifteen sessions in a month
9247821 rents gone up a bit man so itd be a few more sessions than that and i dont know about having an ad up in the back of the voice someone might recognize me
9247822 youre so shy that its almost cute but actually i think a better thing would be for you to set up a bordello theres lots of them in the thirties around madison first off
9247823 its going to have to wait ive got a life changing powerpoint presentation to give
9247824 acho que a obedi ncia t tica foi o destaque do time conseguimos quebrar o passe do advers rio e manter o uma tima rela o no bloqueio defesa
9247825 fizemos uma boa partida mas ainda falhamos em detalhes soubemos aproveitar bem os contra ataques e para a pr xima partida teremos de caprichar ainda mais
9247826 a vit ria por 3 a 0 foi muito importante gostei da organiza o das atletas em quadra e especialmente do sistema defensivo
9247827 acho que vamos evoluir ainda mais e a partir de segunda feira vamos treinar em fun o do pinheiros
9247828 god puts me through hell so i could make it to heaven
9247829 there are lots of versatile players but no true big men unlike last year when eman samigue was there
9247830 we dont have draft picks at a time when we need new blood to strengthen the team
9247831 at the end of the day you cant say sh
9247832 at the end of the day you cant say sh g shock galore rebel xt star ocean psp lumix digital camera sony mylo north face p rod playoff xiii og nike court forces af25 jordan 19s gibson sb omggzz size11 12 computers cell phones cameras and photoshop played for a while then mos def quit kills way too much time for a video game gave my account to my cousin with mad gold to make sure i never played it again always looking for casual shoes i have a life btw whats up with you guys starting a new topic in the wrong threads i dont play it and definately dont want to i have a life btw whats up with you guys starting a new topic in the wrong threads just because you play doesnt mean you dont have a life usually its just a time killing games to others and to others they take it too serious so they play 100 hours a week i dont play dont plan to dont want to get addicted like the people of southpark aint mid sole enough you should be happy gentry made the motherfcukers
9247833 at least we were able to accomplish our goals up to this point we just have to wait and find out who were going to play but were not going to be satisfied we still want to go a lot further than just first place in the elimination round we want to win the championship
9247834 we have a tendency to relax when our opponent is no longer in the running for the final four we must have a killer instinct
9247835 it limits the use of power sharing in resolving self determination conflicts and it is a disincentive to the bangsamoro liberation movement to use negotiation as a peaceful and democratic method of resolving its conflict with the government
9247836 if they insist then we expect more people to be displaced and more indiscriminate firing of howitzers by the military
9247837 they have initialed the moa ad and we will continue to ask the government to comply with it
9247838 so the government orchestrated all these things they do not really have any intention of signing the moa
9247839 for me this cancellation of moa ad is unjust the government and the milf have been talking for many years now the government is quick to declare it null
9247840 we were not thankful this happened we needed the moa ad if it will not be pushed through violence will continue in mindanao
9247841 our suspicions are confirmed with the way things are happening now the ddr is actually a replication of the framework of the governments peace negotiation with the national democratic front which stalled since 2004
9247842 it has manipulated and orchestrated the failure of the peace talks
9247843 what was that for whatever is happening right now is not just a matter of some peace panel negotiators not following orders from malaca ang but an intentional move to stall the peace process and to pressure the milf to shift into the ddr framework of the government
9247844 the search and retrieval team expressed high optimism that these are the fuselage and tail respectively
9247845 she gave instructions to begin the preparation for the london games
9247846 she wants a better showing starting with the sea games next year
9247847 as far as pagcor is concerned it is willing to follow the law
9247848 playing a tough opponent like michigan early in the season is only going to make us stronger once we get into conference play
9247849 i wish wouldve executed better offensively but michigan was an aggressive seving team and we were not that was a big difference in the outcome
9247850 i view this with great concern and ive sent my boys to the ground to see how these people do it
9247851 yes it is corruption when i talked to the transport operators they said they dont want to be the target of a witch hunt
9247852 lo mas frustrante ha sido la indolencia de muchas de las autoridades su insensibilidad
9247853 yo siempre me he cuestionado por qu por qu yo por qu mi hija y la verdad no he encontrado una respuesta
9247854 this wasnt just a good start for our team it really was a great start
9247855 the ability level of the teams in the tournament really tested many facets of our team and i thought that we passed the test on this first weekend with flying colors i was as impressed with our resiliency and ability to push through rough spots in matches as i was with our execution throughout the tournament
9247856 i would not have been able to do this without the terrific play by the rest of our team
9247857 we were able to spread our offense over a number of players which created seams in the blocks and made it easier for me to get kills
9247858 as i told nikki on a couple of occasions during timeouts and between games i was more impressed with her defensive intensity and aggressiveness than i was with her stats that show up in the box score
9247859 i continue to be astounded with her ability to be a go to player for us at such a young age
9247860 milan has really done a great job of becoming a terminator for us
9247861 she came up with might have been the biggest kill of the match late in the fourth game when marquette was trying very hard to turn the momentum in their favor she played at a consistently high level all weekend and i am happy that she was awarded for her accomplishments on the court
9247862 i am so proud that kylie was recognized for her blue collar approach to the game
9247863 she consistently plays at a high level in all aspects of the game hitting passing and defensively she has become an anchor and steadying force for our team
9247864 i have to give 100 percent of the credit to the setters
9247865 their sets were incredibly consistent throughout the entire match and they provided me with the opportunity to have success today
9247866 getting three wins this weekend was a great confidence booster
9247867 we were here to make a statement after last season come out on fire and show everybody that we are back to playing at the level that we want to play at
9247868 chloe has worked very hard in the offseason to improve her passing and it really showed up this weekend she has always been a great defensive player and someone who has a great feel for reading plays she is playing more under control and has become a defensive pillar that we can rely on every game
9247869 this was a match that we probably would not have won last season
9247870 i am very proud of how we fought back to win the fifth set after not playing very well in the third and fourth games when we were in system we were extremely effective today the thing that we need to learn from this match is how to sustain that level of play for an entire match without letting down
9247871 god puts me through hell so i could make it to heaven
9247872 ao longo dos 90 minutos embora o benfica tenha tido per odos em que equilibrou o jogo o fc porto foi superior teve mais oportunidades n o jog mos bem no ltimo ter o do campo falh mos muito nas transi es mas tivemos ocasi es suficientes para ganhar
9247873 foi um bom jogo em condi es normais ter amos feito um resultado melhor mas as circunst ncias complicaram um pouco acho que em algumas fases at estivemos melhores que o fc porto
9247874 depois da expuls o do katsouranis foi tudo mais complicado com dez a minha miss o ficou muito mais dif cil mas acredito que houve dois jogos um antes e outro depois da expuls o na primeira parte n o estivemos ao melhor n vel mas na segunda fomos melhores se n o tivesse havido esse lance se calhar o resultado seria diferente
9247875 empatar em casa n o um resultado positivo sempre mau mesmo que seja com um rival directo mas entr mos no jogo quase a perder empat mos e se calhar at consegu amos ganhar se estiv ssemos com onze at ao final
9247876 n o foi o resultado que esper vamos mas pronto na altura em que pod amos virar o jogo tivemos a expuls o penso que foi um bom jogo o empate acaba por ser justo
9247877 o jogo assim mesmo penso que fizemos uma boa exibi o
9247878 se quaresma n o vier continuaremos a olhar para a frente pedi o jogador h muito mas se a decis o da administra o for a de eu trabalhar com este plantel sei que tenho uma ptima base

9247915 i said it would be great to take it from him
9247916 i told him ive been carrying this torch for 41 years and would be pleased to pass it on to him
9247917 he said he had a long way to go and i told him to keep doing what hes doing
9247918 i do like his chances hes been pretty dominating in every game and i love how he challenges hitters he might be the only one in the league without a streak of poor performances hes an incredible young man so poised for his age and his upbeat and relaxed attitude is a real positive
9247919 strikeouts and era are in your control wins and reaching the playoffs are not
9247920 for timmy to be a strong candidate hes got to win 18 or 19 but itll be tough if webb keeps winning
9247921 the thing with timmy he just wants to go pitch he enjoys pitching everything else is a bonus
9247922 its great to hear a cy young winner say ive got a chance

9247935 i struggled a little bit in first inning and didnt get into a good rhythm

9247947 we are all becoming heavier and it is a global responsibility

9248032 he has spoken at a number of these things in the past
9248033 he hasnt shown respect to israel and many of the jewish constituencies here based on the things he has done
9248034 i think its hard to ask a political party to take a former president and say were not going to hear you at all

9248069 attempt was made to resolve a complicated ethno territorial issue by the use of force
9248070 russia acted calmly wisely and beautifully this was a calm response peace has been established in the region and it will last
9248071 the chinese side was informed of the political and legal motives behind russias decision and expressed an understanding of them
9248072 china had expressed its understanding of russias decision to recognize georgias breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia

9248075 since yesterdays shocking arrival of gov sarah palin as john mccains running mate there has been the usual cable news and print blathering about the pick from those who know little about her
9248076 alaskas former commissioner of public safety says gov sarah palin john mccains pick to be vice president personally talked him on two occasions about a state trooper who was locked in a bitter custody battle with the governors sister
9248077 in a phone conversation friday night walt monegan who was alaskas top cop until palin fired him july 11 told the daily news that the governor also had e mailed him two or three times about her ex brother in law trooper mike wooten though the e mails didnt mention wooten by name monegan claims his refusal to fire wooten was a major reason that palin dismissed him wooten had been suspended for five days previously based largely on complaints that palins family had initiated before palin was governor
9248078 i have a hard time seeing how her qualifications stack up against the duties and responsibilities of being president i expect her to stick with simple truths when asked about continued american troop presence in iraq she said she knows only one thing about that i paraphrase no one has attacked the american homeland since george bush took the war to iraq
9248079 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9248080 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation

9248084 as russia struggled to rally international support for its military action in georgia prime minister vladimir putin has lashed out at the us
9248085 the suspicion would arise that someone in the united states created this conflict on purpose to stir up the situation and to create an advantage for one of the candidates in the competitive race for the presidency in the united states
9248086 it is hard to think of a more cynical and contemptuous political act this year than john mccains selection of sarah palin as his vice presidential running mate

9248106 fertilizer use was not a common practice in the united states until after 1870 when phosphate and lime were applied to crops like cotton and tobacco by the end of world war ii an era of intensive agriculture began
9248107 of the phosphate produced in florida about 95 is used in agriculture 90 goes into fertilizer and 5 into livestock feed supplements
9248108 radium wastes from filtration systems at phosphate fertilizer facilities are among the most radioactive types of naturally occurring radioactive material wastes uranium and all of its decay rate products are found in phosphate rock fluorosilicic acid fluoride and phosphate fertilizer
9248109 removal of uranium as a product is no longer profitable and all of the extraction facilities have been dismantled the uranium that remains in the phosphoric acid and fertilizer products is at a low enough level that it is safe for use
9248110 the nature of our operations doesnt require that we carry both
9248111 in order to seek ones own direction one must simplify the mechanics of ordinary everyday life
9248112 choose to live simply so that others may simply live
9248113 hmm i never thought of that as simplicity but it really does make perfect sense
9248114 it will be miserable if we stay no water no power
9248115 we are still in the cone of probability especially for a storm surge
9248116 i am strongly encouraging people in the city to evacuate all tourists i ask you to leave do not wait
9248117 they dont want to leave without their dogs i cant blame them i wouldnt leave without mine
9248118 obviously people can stay we are encouraging them to leave
9248119 we know this is a very difficult decision emotions are very high but we have to take a practical approach to this
9248120 this time we have 1 500 police officers and 1 500 to 2 000 national guard double the amount of protection during katrina
9248121 we are getting information earlier buses are coming during katrina not one thing was organized it was a state of panic and havoc
9248122 but whether it is a category 4 or 5 it is extremely dangerous either way
9248123 the storm is far out and could change direction when you get to texas they could tell you it is heading that way so go to new orleans
9248124 this is much better we dont have all that violence
9248125 alaskas former commissioner of public safety says gov sarah palin john mccains pick to be vice president personally talked him on two occasions about a state trooper who was locked in a bitter custody battle with the governors sister
9248126 in a phone conversation friday night walt monegan who was alaskas top cop until palin fired him july 11 told the daily news that the governor also had e mailed him two or three times about her ex brother in law trooper mike wooten though the e mails didnt mention wooten by name monegan claims his refusal to fire wooten was a major reason that palin dismissed him wooten had been suspended for five days previously based largely on complaints that palins family had initiated before palin was governor
9248127 i have a hard time seeing how her qualifications stack up against the duties and responsibilities of being president i expect her to stick with simple truths when asked about continued american troop presence in iraq she said she knows only one thing about that i paraphrase no one has attacked the american homeland since george bush took the war to iraq
9248128 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9248129 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9248130 the left wing liberal media has brainwashed everyone into believing bush is a bad guy
9248131 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven
9248132 to have it planned at the same time that it would actually be on its way to new orleans for day one of the republican convention up in the twin cities at the top of the mississippi river
9248133 i dont know if you showed the cake there that they had there three years ago today with mccain and bush when marie antoinette when she said let them eat cake i think she was speaking figuratively they literally were while new orleans was drowning eating cake so its um i dont know lets hope things get better
9248134 the friday interviewing was conducted in an unusual political environment the first conducted fully after obamas well regarded acceptance speech gallup notes
9248135 higher than any other other recent candidate has received gallup reports
9248136 adding to the brutality of a national campaign the palin family also has an infant with special needs what leads you the senator and the governor to believe that one wont affect the other in the next couple of months
9248137 she has an infant she has an infant with special needs will that affect her campaigning
9248138 about whos taking care of the children traditionally has very much angered women voters when women candidates are asked those questions and male candidates never are

9248147 im looking at him right now and i see perfection yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
9248148 a significant part of palins base of support lies among social and christian conservatives her positions on social issues emerged slowly during the campaign on abortion should be banned for anything other than saving the life of the mother stem cell research opposed physician assisted suicide opposed creationism should be discussed in schools state health benefits for same sex partners opposed and supports a constitutional amendment to bar them

9248156 think about podcasting where is that going if you can guess that one correctly get back to us all its been a crazy ride so far

9248158 yes the latest incarnation of apples mobile device the iphone 3g lasts for only half a day or just a few hours if youre a heavy user on a fully charged battery and since it does not have an accessible battery compartment you wont be able to replace the drained battery with a new one either

9248166 i dont know if theyve just come to accept the fact that they dont have retirement
9248167 and if they dont read the contract theyll just keep taking away stuff until they dont have retirement which is what they want they want to take away their retirements
9248168 we are more than willing to talk to the union and discuss the contract with them in more detail that said this is truly our final offer
9248169 they said turn on your news right now so we did
9248170 weve been glued to the tv for the next we just turned it off for about seven hours
9248171 even though she is not that experienced i think she will rise to that occasion
9248172 does he mccain think thats really going to work i mean does he think that women who are with hillary think hillary is some lego block you know you can take out a red one and put in a green one
9248173 well i hope i get invited to the inauguration i would go wouldnt you
9248174 sometimes you open the lid and it will be in there
9248175 overall i think the downtown community would be supportive because you would have open clear alleyways people would be able to see up and down and people wouldnt be able to hide behind them to do illegal activity
9248176 i think most of the community would be supportive depending on how much it costs and the logistics of pickup and how convenient or inconvenient it would be

9248186 kajian kajian ilmiah dan bibiliografi mengenai krakatau hampir hampir luput mencantumkan satu satunya sumber pribumi tertulis yang mencatat kesaksian mengenai letusan krakatau di tahun 1883 itu
9248187 katanya sebelum meletus tanggal 26 27 dan 28 agustus 1883 gunung krakatau telah batuk batuk sejak 20 mei 1883 letusan dahsyat krakatau menimbulkan awan panas setinggi 70 km dan tsunami setinggi 40 meter dan menewaskan sekitar 36 000 orang
9248188 tak lama kemudian muncul edisi kedua syair ini dengan judul inilah
9248189 edisi keempat syair ini edisi terakhir sejauh yang saya ketahui berjudul inilah syair lampung karam adanya 36 halaman edisi keempat ini juga diterbitkan di singapura bertarikh 10 safat 1306 h 16 oktober 1888
9248190 muhammad saleh mengaku berada di tanjung karang ketika letusan krakatau terjadi dan menyaksikan akibat bencana alam yang hebat itu dengan mata kepalanya sendiri sangat mungkin si penulis syair itu adalah seorang korban letusan krakatau yang pergi mengungsi ke singapura dan membawa kenangan menakutkan tentang bencana alam yang mahadahsyat itu
9248191 saya berharap syair lampung karam dapat dibaca oleh pembaca masa kini yang tidak bisa lagi membaca aksara arab melayu jawi lebih jauh saya ingin juga membandingkan pandangan penulis pribumi satu satunya itu dengan penulis asing belanda eropa terhadap letusan gunung krakatau
9248192 ini merupakan pengalaman tersendiri dan berharga buat saya yang pasti akan selalu menjadi salah satu topik obrolan saya bila bertemu dengan orang lain
9248193 yang lebih keren lagi dibonceng moto x2 oleh randy mamola yang legendaris di sepang malaysia
9248194 zakat itu kan sistem jaminan sosial yang belum disentuh barat sistem zakat yang diterapkan di negara kita tidak akan lapuk oleh jaman dan tertelan format pembangunan yang ada maka kita perlu mengajak masyarakat lebih aware

9248196 ini tergantung kepada ahli warisnya kalo keluarga pejabat ya besar
9248197 banyak yang ingin meniru tapi kami punya resep rahasia yang tidak mungkin ditiru itu resep turunan dari bapak
9248198 waktu itu bapak pindah ke jalan pegangsaan dari jalan semarang jalan cilacap sekarang jadi apartemen menteng eksekutif di situ jualan esnya ditambah makanan lain seperti bakso dan siomai sampai sekitar tahun 1984 terus pindah ke sini megaria lebih enak karena bentuknya kan warung kalau dulu di pegangsaan kan kita masih pakai tenda dan modelnya orang makan di mobil mobil jentrek jentrek berderet deret red orangnya makan di dalam mobil
9248199 tapi sebenarnya dulu bapak saya mulainya kan jual siomai bahkan sebelum jual es teler jadi kalau orang zaman dulu biasanya cari siomai juga
9248200 kita enggak pakai santan hanya sirup dan susu sirupnya itu yang resepnya rahasia
9248201 kita pakai ayam ras bukan ayam kampung ayam kampung mahal yang penting kan mengolahnya bagaimana ayam potong jadi tidak berlemak kemudian masaknya dengan bumbu rempah yang kita bikin sendiri bukan bumbu instan
9248202 rumah ini dibangun tahun 1934 oleh kakek saya pada zaman penjajahan belanda nah pengaruh penguasa kala itu menjadikan rumah ini bergaya indies ini disesuaikan dengan iklim indonesia yang tropis
9248203 kami tidak akan mengubahnya apalagi sampai menjualnya kami tetap akan merawatnya walaupun tanpa bantuan orang lain ini demi generasi muda indonesia agar mengenal para pejuangnya
9248204 semuanya masih asli batanya bata merah yang besar besar dan direkatkan bukan dengan semen tapi menggunakan campuran kapur dengan pasir campuran ini lebih kuat dari semen kapur ini berfungsi untuk menghindari rayap dan kelembaban untuk memasang ubin juga harus dilapisi pasir dulu biar nggak ada rayap saya kira teknik itu masih relevan digunakan saat ini
9248205 waktu kami masih bayi ditempatkan di kamar nomor dua kalau bapak sedang bekerja dan mendengar tangisan beliau lalu menuju ke kamar demikian juga ketika berada di kamar tidur jadinya memudahkan dan efisien
9248206 karena anak anak bapak banyak maka dibuatlah kamar untuk masing masing anak kamar itu juga sering sebagai pondokan bagi masyarakat yang ingin belajar agama
9248207 inilah kepribadian kakek saya sejak dulu kepedulian sosialnya tinggi makanya sampai saat ini kita mempertahankan citra kakek kita kami pun tidak membuat pagar pembatas agar bisa berbaur dengan warga setempat
9248208 kakek saya tidak berjuang secara fisik tapi berjuang dengan intelektualnya beliau adalah ulama dan berjuang dengan ilmunya kakek saya menyerukan kepada para umaro untuk berjuang melawan penjajah utamanya kakek saya berjuang lewat pendidikan

9248226 i the prime minister have come to office in the righteous way and i wont resign
9248227 i will not back down i will rule this country and will lead it through all of the problems
9248228 since the government cannot resolve the problem even the courts cannot resolve the problem the joint session of parliament is the best choice for finding a solution
9248229 the coalition partners have the impression that the situation is deteriorating and we are thinking of telling the prime minister to decide on the future of the government

9248246 vos a la tuya y yo a la m a
9248247 creo que mccain no conoce a los estadounidenses qui n m s podr a proponer cientos de miles de millones de d lares de recortes de impuestos para las grandes empresas y las compa as petroleras pero ni un centavo que alivie la situaci n de m s de 100 millones de ciudadanos
9248248 esta noche estoy ante ustedes porque algo vibrante recorre a ee uu soy consciente de que no soy el candidato m s usual para el cargo carezco del t pico pedigree pero esta elecci n es sobre ustedes

9248251 la r plica parece surrealista no se entiende que un presidente responda a un informe t cnico que plantea riesgos y oportunidades de inversi n
9248252 pero adem s de eso lo que llama la atenci n es que la presidenta cuestiona la capacidad anal tica de una entidad respetada y se queda en eso sin responder a los argumentos que all se exponen
9248253 esa maldita peste era una cosa indispensable en el mejor de los mundos posibles pues de los males particulares resulta necesariamente el bien general
9248254 las cosas no pueden suceder de otro modo porque estando todo hecho para un fin todo lleva necesariamente hacia el fin mejor

9248258 tras seis nuevos controles llegamos a gori no estamos en el centro de la ciudad pero de ese carrefour controlado por un tanque enorme y alto como un b nker con ruedas podemos constatar los incendios que se pierden en el horizonte de nuevo el vac o el olor ligero de putrefacci n y de muerte gori no pertenece a esa osetia que los rusos pretenden haber venido a liberar es una ciudad de georgia la han quemado pillado reducido al estado de ciudad fantasma vaciado
9248259 la ciudad ha sido limpiada gori es una ciudad fantasma hay incendios en todas partes gori ha sido vaciada de su poblaci n

9248266 es agosto hace mucho calor y usted sabe pues no hay quien quede en madrid por eso es que aqu nadie le prest ninguna atenci n al informe de esos dos funcionarios del banco central de espa a en el que pon an a la argentina en la misma situaci n de irak sin dudas un disparate por eso mismo fue sorpresivo que haya sido la presidenta quien saliera a responder un informe que tiene poca entidad
9248267 no va a haber ning n gesto p blico que refleje el malestar existente aqu con el gobierno argentino pero que lo hay lo hay
9248268 encima no le pusieron ni una mesa ni una silla para estar un poco m s c modo
9248269 por eso es que n stor est tratando de alambrar la provincia para impedir la huida hacia el duhaldismo de muchos de esos intendentes
9248270 hay predisposici n de la mayor a para aceptar la reincorporaci n de todos los que quieran volver pero en el caso de cobos no para ser reincorporado cobos deber a dejar de ser parte del gobierno y eso significar a su renuncia al cargo el impacto institucional que ello tendr a ser a muy malo nosotros no queremos eso cobos debe completar su mandato junto a la presidenta
9248271 desde que ocurri esto al embajador lo est n llamando casi todos los d as de la dea drug enforcement administration para saber novedades sobre este hecho
9248272 cuando alguien con el perfil de forza hace un aporte de esa suma a una campa a electoral lo hace a cambio de una contraprestaci n
9248273 estimado edi zunino me consta su capacidad profesional sagacidad y rapidez mental pero me sorprende su ingenuidad en serio cree que fueron necesarios us 800 000 para solventar parte de la campa a al mes de asumir la presidenta alberto f reasign 2 400 millones de un organismo a otro digame de verdad es posible tomar riesgos por esa cifra
9248274 por que o senhor defende o aborto de anenc falos para mim pac fico n o h a menor possibilidade de sobreviv ncia quando n o se tem c rebro
9248275 em 2004 o plen rio do stf derrubou uma liminar concedida pelo senhor que autorizava a interrup o da gesta o de anenc falos por que o senhor decidiu trazer o assunto tona novamente tomei como base o resultado da recente vota o na corte do uso de c lulas tronco embrion rias em pesquisas cient ficas desta vez a vota o ser menos apertada do que foi no caso das c lulas tronco diria que teremos um 7 a 4 ou um 8 a 3 e depois que o supremo bater o martelo n o adiantar recorrer ao santo padre
9248276 o senhor acredita que a maior flexibiliza o do stf abre a possibilidade para a discuss o do aborto em geral sem d vida o debate atual um passo importante para que n s os ministros do supremo selecionemos elementos que no futuro possam respaldar o julgamento do aborto de forma mais ampla
9248277 para os que se op em ao aborto no entanto a mulher n o tem direito a essa liberdade a igreja cat lica por exemplo argumenta que a vida deve sempre ser acolhida como um dom preciso esclarecer que a vida pressup e o parto o c digo civil prev o direito do nascituro ou seja daquele que nasceu respirando por esfor o pr prio
9248278 p e a salvo desde a concep o os direitos do nascituro
9248279 dessa forma o debate se estende para outras reas talvez at mais pantanosas do que o aborto como a eutan sia a eutan sia pressup e uma irreversibilidade da vida mediante laudos m dicos que comprovem o quadro as decis es poder o ficar a cargo de outra pessoa afirmo isso com base no princ pio da dignidade da pessoa humana e n o pode haver dignidade com uma vida vegetativa
9248280 como cat lico o senhor n o entra em conflito por suas convic es a respeito desses temas nenhum n o potencializo a religi o a ponto de colocar em segundo plano a raz o n s integrantes do supremo os guardi es maiores da constitui o n o podemos nos render apatia que o mal do nosso s culo

9248290 manuels doesnt make any sense its way out of our way are you sure
9248291 are you listening to a female folk singer play smells like teen spirit
9248292 that doesnt seem ironic to you do you recall the screaming fits you threw when heather and i listened to nirvana and when heather hung the wall sized kurt cobain poster above her bed and the courtney love poster next to it and you cried and then dragged us to family therapy
9248293 yes i do think it is ironic but shes good its patti smith listen to her
9248294 she isnt good unless you consider making this song sound even worse than the original a feat in itself
9248295 please tell me this next song isnt a folk rendition of gangstas paradise mom who is this woman and why cant she write her own songs
9248296 its pasttime paradise and you should listen to the words very progressive i like it
9248297 mom do you remember when heather started blasting tupac every day and you were worried and remember when i obsessed over the beastie boys for a year and you were embarrassed what do you think this moment is like for me
9248298 fine take a nap i dont care you wanted me to postpone my farming trip to help you pack up and move so i did and now you want to nap alright

9248301 we wanted an event to introduce intramurals to new students
9248302 so many students dont realize that if they dont make the football team there are so many other options available
9248303 people always get bummed after high school that there is no more football or no more soccer
9248304 it is a great way to get involved meet new people and stay active
9248305 i enjoy the competitiveness of intramurals and the fact that i dont have to travel to play sports
9248306 i like intramurals because it gets me away from school
9248307 im used to studying all the time so its a nice way to get involved
9248308 there is definitely a lot more camaraderie in intramural sports than club because you are playing against other people you may know so its a lot more laid back and fun
9248309 it is a great way to show students how to get involved in ways that are cheaper and much more convenient
9248310 what is so great about having a rec center on campus is that they can branch out to what students are involved in
9248311 its nice to not have the pressure of being good enough for a team but still get to play and be involved on campus
9248312 people put a lot more work into this much more than ever youre seeing bigger crews the riverblast queen had eight people and the narren float had 12 people paddling
9248313 the quality of the floats was impressive a lot of work went into it
9248314 it riverblast calls attention to this regions greatest natural resource
9248315 you dont know what youve got until its gone we dont want that to happen
9248316 people are so grateful that its free and open its pretty grassroots here
9248317 just really stepped up and gave to this event to help keep it a free event
9248318 we will voice our many concerns and unanswered questions at the planning and zoning meeting in st peter on monday september 15
9248319 we are not opposed to wind energy and in fact think that wind energy is a top choice for electric power going green into the future however there are places much better suited than this area for wind turbines
9248320 we the surrounding landowners including the three landowners who have signed the leases with the new ulm puc have opposed this project from the start
9248321 what is happening is they nupuc have made application for a meteorological tower for an anemometer to measure and record wind speed we of course have had a couple phone calls regarding that the tower is all that is going to be on there but theyre still going to come and voice their concerns
9248322 the only thing that is going to take place is that the planning and zoning is going to make a recommendation based on the meteorological tower application no wind turbine
9248323 what we have to do is place the tower about 1 000 feet away from where the turbine will be on the prevailing wind side of it

9248369 you need to be scared and you need to get your butts out of new orleans right now

9248379 she was performing one night this was the first night that she had gathered a group of girls to play when the dj was going to introduce the band she said what do we call you guys and just at that moment mustang sally the song was playing on the jukebox so she said just call us mustang sally so now we play that song almost every night

9248397 my daughters were hands on d i y do it yourself we did a lot of our own wedding preparations including floral arrangements bouquets and the wedding favors
9248398 but it turns out we couldve gotten better quality favors for a lot less time and money online you need to know which areas will save you a lot of money by doing it yourself and when its actually less expensive to purchase online
9248399 my plan is to focus on selling the highest quality favors at the lowest price
9248400 when brides plan weddings they need a good informational source what works what doesnt work everybody is budget conscious i want it to be a resource for brides

9248421 twilight in an ancient desert land the slaves have all been gathered before an enormous semi circular platform behind the platform the spires and towers of the great palace are outlined against a fading sky before the platform is a sea of loin clothed slaves kneeling in the desert sand which has grown cool with the setting of the sun the camera focuses on the central part of the platform where a number of slaves have been tied to a row of freestanding pillars from the crown of each pillar emanates a clean steady flame that provides generous illumination for the entire platform and places special emphasis on the restrained bodies of the slaves on either side of the platform are the seated figures of the royal family priests and high priests high ranking military officers and other notable persons of the kingdom after the sun has disappeared behind some distant sand dunes leaving tens of thousands of slaves in total darkness the proceedings finally commence the head executioner and several of his assistants now ascend the enormous platform from a stairway to the right the camera follows behind them as they approach the flaming pillars where the bound slaves await an elaborate regimen of torture that will continue throughout the night and end with their simultaneous deaths at sunrise but when the head executioner reaches the center of the platform and turns to receive a sinister looking instrument held out to him by one of his assistants he suddenly freezes in position a statue with outstretched arms and open hands at this point one of the slaves kneeling toward the front of the massive audience rises to his feet and jumps onto the platform no one makes a move to stop him the slave walks up to the flaming pillars and scans the horrified faces of his fellows who are anticipating a night of agony and ultimately death after a while he simply shrugs and turns away from them stepping over to the head executioner the slave looks the frozen figure up and down with the fingers of his right hand he probes beneath the wide gold neck band which the head executioner is wearing and which is symbolic of his office some moments pass with no change in the gruesome functionarys state the slave now appears to be slightly exasperated he removes his fingers from the gold neck band and with the heel of his right hand gives the statue like figure a sharp rap on the side of the head the head executioner then goes into motion once again seizing the proffered implement of pain and picking up where he left off before returning to his place the slaves glance around as if to see if any of the others might require maintenance excepting those tied to the flaming pillars who are the only living persons among the assemblage of automatons occupying the platform he then rejoins his fellow slaves none of whom in any way acknowledge that he was ever absent from their ranks although they too are all flesh and blood beings briefly deferred the long night of torture and death can finally begin followed by a feast upon the bodies of the dead

9248480 in her acceptance speech as mccains running mate friday morning palin held up her opposition to the bridge from ketchikan to gravina the bridge to nowhere as an example of the abuses of earmark spending when campaigning in ketchikan in september 2006 palin promised ketchikan residents the bridge
9248481 i served with hillary clinton i know hillary clinton hillary clinton is a friend of mine you sarah palin are no hillary clinton
9248482 t he most important question in evaluating a vice presidential pick is whether that person is prepared to step into the oval office
9248483 that stunned even some party leaders who fear that voters will have trouble imagining the former beauty queen as commander in chief if it should ever come to that
9248484 but what surprises me so much is that john mccain again and again and again has said the transcendent issue of our times is the fight against terrorism and that we live in a dark dangerous world and the most important thing is to have a commander in chief thats ready so here to reach out and hes criticized barack obama as not being ready to reach out to sarah palin who has no national security experience no national security exposure and say youre my standby and im 72 years old and ive had some bouts with melanoma i think thats a very large gamble and i wonder how its going to play out with the american people
9248485 shes to be president at this point in time if mccain were to die in february 2009 i hope palin would have the good sense to appoint someone who is more ready to be president to be her vice president on the understanding that she would then resign and be appointed vice president by her successor
9248486 when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying the cross
9248487 putting america first hes worried about his conservative base and hes an asshole although they phrase that one slightly differently
9248488 were desperate weve been fighting for five years we want an answer
9248489 we ask authorities with all our heart to be more sensitive maybe nothing like this has happened to them or they would be more sensitive
9248490 the most frustrating thing has been the indolence of many of the authorities their insensitivity
9248491 its very big and weve got to get ready for whats coming
9248492 its been following us all over cuba ruining our vacation
9248493 they have closed everything hotels restaurants bars museums theres not much to do but wait
9248494 people dont have a lot of exposure to the army
9248495 its incumbent upon the american public to know about their army
9248496 this is a little more than what we had in mind in such a short time
9248497 considering the lack of real security during the height of the katrina chaos it seems officials are hoping to instill some that the situation here will remain under control
9248498 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9248499 i dont think the hurricane will break them but i dont want someone breaking in
9248500 there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9248501 if we dont get the wind and rain we stand ready to help them
9248502 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9248503 and it is warm not something im really used to
9248504 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9248505 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case for me
9248506 she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant
9248507 can step in and become president and i dont think anybody has any doubt about that
9248508 counsel and advice of somebody whos not going to agree with me 100 percent of the time
9248509 but for the rest of us theres still no change
9248510 we plan to start when were going to start and end when were going to end
9248511 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now this is the storm of the century
9248512 this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day
9248513 we could see flooding even worse than we saw in hurricane katrina
9248514 i wouldnt worry about whether the evacuation in your parish begins at 4 p m today or 8 a m tomorrow
9248515 when it comes to evacuation do it sooner rather than later
9248516 my last 24 hours have been somewhat worrisome and very very prayerful because this is a very serious threat and its a lot of people to get to safe ground or be safe where they are
9248517 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9248518 were keeping a very close eye on what this hurricane is doing
9248519 if it looks like its going to hit we will obviously drastically change our plans
9248520 like all americans our prayers are with those who will be affected by hurricane gustav
9248521 we continue to closely monitor the movement of the storm and are considering necessary contingencies
9248522 we are in communication with the gulf state governors to make sure the convention is taking all the appropriate steps as the hurricane progresses
9248523 the safety of our affected delegations is our first priority and preparing for gustav comes before anything else
9248524 it would be a disservice to the american people if they cannot see our convention too
9248525 im afraid chris that we may have to look at that situation and well try and monitor it ive been talking to govs jindal barbour of mississippi riley of alabama and crist ive been talking to all of them
9248526 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9248527 ive instructed my senate staff to monitor the situation closely to make sure weve contacted both fema but also private relief organizations just to make sure that whatever happens people are prepared
9248528 obviously were going to be each day seeing what happens and were praying for new orleans but we want to make sure that people are making all the necessary precautions
9248529 this time theyre not taking any chances so say a prayer
9248530 went down there for a week after when the hurricane hit last time
9248531 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane
9248532 we have invested a significant amount of money in levee protection so im not anticipating the same type of levee flooding we had with katrina
9248533 emotionally can we handle it i think theres a lot of fragileness in the city
9248534 its going to be a tough one but new orleanians are very resilient
9248535 i dont like it going someplace you dont know people you dont know
9248536 and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9248537 evacuation packing dont forget your prom shoes or your great grandmothers pearls
9248538 you wont see people stranded in the superdome every step that weve gone through this process weve adjusted and we have a better plan now
9248539 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane
9248540 i dont like it going someplace you dont know people you dont know
9248541 and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9248542 once the storm gets into the gulf i think thats when were going to see another surge of people seeking to evacuate
9248543 we need to get them out of the way so we can deal with our senior citizens and those who need our assistance
9248544 if you decide to stay you will be required to stay inside of your property
9248545 emotionally can we handle it i think there is a lot of fragileness about our psyche right now in this city
9248546 i wouldnt be honest with you if i told you something different
9248547 its going to be a tough but new orleaneans are very resilient and they are very tough and well get through this
9248548 i was there yesterday met with the mayor met with the governor its the best preparedness ive seen im very proud of what theyve done in the last couple of years to get not only the city but the entire state ready
9248549 so the governor and the mayor and the parish called for evacuations
9248550 were asking people to pay close attention to that when called to evacuate please evacuate
9248551 what youre seeing is a total culture change in not only how this organization is going to respond but how the states and local communities are going to respond the things you saw happening after katrina buses coming in ambulances coming in food moving in urban rescue teams coming in are happening before the storm the state has contracted for over 700 buses theyve started to arrive ambulances are arriving urban search and rescue teams on the ground the coast guard is standing by ready everyone is ready for the storm
9248552 if people living there are asked to evacuate they should not depend on the levees
9248553 evacuate take shelter and come back to the city after the storms over
9248554 he told each of the governors that federal officials were monitoring hurricane gustav very closely
9248555 president bush pledged the full support of the federal government
9248556 it wasnt last time and hopefully weve learned from that tragedy
9248557 we are deeply concerned ive instructed my senate staff to monitor the situation closely make sure weve contacted both fema but also private relief organizations just to make sure that whatever happens people are prepared
9248558 were praying for new orleans but we want to make sure that people are making all the necessary precautions
9248559 we dont want folks worrying about their property it is time for people to be worried about their personal safety
9248560 things werent really as bad as they could have been
9248561 canadians should prepare themselves for cases like the listeriosis incident as we continue to deregulate this is the result of a risk based system that puts business in front of health
9248562 processed food will never be a hundred percent safe to eat no mather how many inspectors you put on the production line

9248564 yeah and youll give every little girl a pony right
9248565 these have got to be moms who are out of the town together for the first time without kids
9248566 i wish the djs on this station werent so bumptious

9248645 its equally clear that managers and management companies are increasingly dominating the industry they are taking the leadership position once held by the record labels finally everyone in the business is bemoaning the lack of good new managers put it all together and what do you get you get the future business model a production management company hybrid that allows producers to discover talent and make hit records and then pass the artist to a separate division of the company which provides the day to day management service

9248679 we went through some lulls at times and its unacceptable we have to look at us as a team and do some soul searching this week we had entirely too many penalties tonight which is another story in itself were old enough right now and have enough people with experience that we have to get over adversity its something that will end up opening our eyes were not going to sit down and get down on ourselves

9248688 biofuels are getting a bad rap because of food prices and deforestation but we need to get some perspective less than two percent of the worlds arable land is devoted to biofuels
9248689 its true that the food price index has tripled since 2000 but thats in response to many factors
9248690 im much more concerned about the loss of arable land than i am about feedstock for biofuels everywhere you go in asia now land is being taken over by buildings where is the worlds food going to be grown
9248691 they have along term view and have invested in value not in revenues neither of which you get from the new zealand investors and they have channels to markets and networks
9248692 thats why weve built our processing plant to fit into a 40 foot container its designed to be deployed into small communities where appropriate
9248693 he made us an offer to buy 100 percent of biojoule weve had other offers but this was different for a couple of reasons first it plugs us directly into asia where there are strategic imperatives to find alternatives to oil that are not derived from soy corn rape or sugar cane that makes woody material and algae pretty interesting second pure power has the business and infrastructure that new zealand investors simply cant offer
9248694 the first project i have asked them to look at is the waste material in palm oil production the trunks husks and branches are all burned or turned into compost our philosophy should be nothing is wasted and thats the kind of thinking that ive seen in new zealand

9248706 i dont know if frank was the no 1 contender but at this point who would be maybe a cheick kongo but heath herring beat cheick kongo with frank mir theres something to promote there
9248707 he was the former heavyweight champion hes known to be the no 1 heavyweight american grappler obviously nogueira is the best brazilian heavyweight grappler i think it has all the ingredients to be a good fight
9248708 im real excited to get my feet back in the octagon
9248709 im looking to erase that loss to nate diaz at ufc fight night 13 in april with a big win over thiago
9248710 thats why i suggested this fight was to move on and not fight a lesser opponent but in my eyes fight an extremely dangerous and tough fighter
9248711 its really important because thats not the kurt pellegrino i wanted everyone to see against diaz
9248712 everyone said i looked great in that fight but i really dont believe them because how i felt heading in to the fight with complications going on
9248713 this is by far the healthiest kurt whether i win or lose against thiago and losing is definitely not in my mind as an option this is really the best ive ever felt
9248714 now i control my own state i run my own school and control my destiny
9248715 i brought in the best people in the world to help me with this fight and sept 6 people will see that
9248716 ive got a great team with me now with my agent dean albrecht ive brought in kevin kern kenny florians strength and conditioning coach and ive been mentoring under kenny florian who is my new coach and is going to be in my corner
9248717 thiagos got good hands good kicks jiu jitsu and is above average in the weight class
9248718 this fight has the making of being a phenomenal fight thats why i took it if i want to beat someone i want to beat myself and i consider thiago the closest person in the ufc to myself
9248719 i always keep steamrolling ahead and fate will only tell me where i go from now
9248720 of course everyone wants to keep winning and be the ufc champion i just want to perform to the best of my abilities
9248721 if that gets me to the top then lets rock n roll but right now i cant even look ahead of me because i have thiago in front of me once i beat him ill be able to answer that question but right now i have to beat him even to answer that question
9248722 first of all i really want to thank the person that made this happen for me my wife
9248723 i want to thank my school kurt pellegrino mixed martial arts www pellegrinomma com kevin kerns sharron wentworth kenny florian gil torres and every single one of my idiot crew in jersey
9248724 i understand why they picked thiago i personally as a manager would have liked him to fight somebody with a bigger name
9248725 yes we were looking for a title shot but just the way that it all worked out it was going to be a while before he gets a title shot lyoto wanted to stay busy and once again being a business i understand why they put this fight together both guys are 13 0 its kind of like whos going to be the first one to get to 14 they have to have some sort of storyline to promote and this makes sense both guys are going to enter the octagon undefeated and one is going to leave with a loss
9248726 if they dont want to fight him thats theyre deal
9248727 from a business standpoint they need to market lyoto a little bit more
9248728 at the end of the day they have to build him up

9248822 we were always concerned that the commission wasnt independent enough to represent the voice of families on important issues for example the anti smacking law
9248823 the plethora of commissions that we have in nz will only be of benefit when they are independent enough from the government of the day to represent the sector that they are supposed to without hidden agendas or future career opportunities
9248824 acknowledge again and explicitly that this nation remains engaged in an armed conflict with al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations who have already proclaimed themselves at war with us and who are dedicated to the slaughter of americans
9248825 this seems like a final push by the administration before they go out the door
9248826 we have been at war with an unconventional enemy whose primary goal is to kill innocent americans
9248827 is trying to stir up again the politics of fear by reminding people of something they havent really forgotten that we are engaged in serious armed conflict with al qaeda
9248828 but the question is where is that conflict to be waged and by what means
9248829 as sept 11 2001 recedes into the past there are some people who have come to think of it as kind of a singular event and of there being nothing else out there
9248830 in a way we are the victims of our own success our own success being that another attack has been prevented
9248831 reaffirm that for the duration of the conflict the united states may detain as enemy combatants those who have engaged in hostilities or purposefully supported al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations
9248832 i dont want to face another situation where we had the sept 14 resolution and then attorney general gonzales claimed that that was authorization to violate fisa
9248833 palin what no way you have got to be kidding bad idea i mean i love her and all she is sooo hot and has a tremendous future ahead of her but in 2008 that is so risky mccain does not need a game changer the game has been moving in his direction for weeks now the obama bounce will go away soon enough he needs someone safer yes romney is my first choice of course but he has too many houses so i have sort of seen the writing on the wall for that for a couple weeks now pawlenty would have been satisfactory safe choice there but palin the media is going to savage us on this there is going to be an immediate backlash please if not romney or pawlenty please tell me that portman can get to dayton without a plane ridge maybe it will be ridge that would be better the abortion thing would bother me a bit and bother a lot of other people a ton but they would all get over it we have to win this election not throw it away on a riverboat gamble how many pro hillary pumas will this really appeal to yes its bold mccain youve got cajones for sure oh i know the evangelicals will love it and thats good we need them but i still dont know my head is spinning i will not be able to eat today how can this be happening yes i know that ultimately vp picks are not that important as to who actually wins but this hurts us in going after obamas inexperience palin i think the world of her but putting her on the ticket is crazy

9248837 het leven is gewoon stil komen te staan voor ons we hebben geen balkons dus we voelen ons enorm opgesloten het is toch van de zotte dat we nu al zes dagen zitten opgesloten en dat dinsdag op zn vroegst de lift kan worden gerepareerd
9248838 normaal ga ik altijd vijf keer per dag de pup van zes weken oud uitlaten nu moet een hondenuitlaatservice dat voor ons doen ook werk ik twee dagen per week in de naschoolse opvang dat kan ik ook wel vergeten
9248839 volgens woningbouwvereniging domijn is de motor van de lift zo oud dat die uit duitsland moet komen en dat duurt langer dan haal je m toch op denk ik dan het lijkt er niet op dat ze erg hard lopen en wij zitten er mooi mee
9248840 de woningbouwvereniging twijfelde over de voorgestelde aanpak daardoor lukte het niet meer om voor het weekend klaar te zijn de liftmotor wordt nu opnieuw gewikkeld zoals dat heet en dat is uiteindelijk de snelste reparatiemethode
9248841 ze wordt naar de kamer geroepen als minister en niet als priv persoon
9248842 ik heb niet om dat onderzoek gevraagd ik heb om de feiten gevraagd ik wil dat de premier het uitzoekt hij kan gewoon aan haar vragen wat er is gebeurd
9248843 ik heb om een verklaring gevraagd niet om dat onderzoek ze had gewoon wat beter in haar geheugen moeten graven ik vind dat ze het gewoon zelf moet betalen
9248844 ik moet me regelmatig inhouden om die knaap die mijn man heeft doodgestoken te grazen te nemen maar ik doe het niet want dan krijg ik twintig jaar
9248845 je kunt hier iemand neersteken en daarna vrolijk je leven weer oppakken de dader kan zelfs nog een eis tot schadevergoeding indienen voor de periode dat hij in voorarrest zat het moet niet gekker worden misschien moet ik gaan emigreren dan ben ik weg uit dit rotland
9248846 henk is verbaal sterk en vroeg een van de jongens wie het gedaan had
9248847 die had een fiets en hij stopte die fiets zolang in onze auto in afwachting van de politie die ik zou bellen vlak daarna kwamen er andere jongens omheen staan henk heeft niet geslagen hij heeft zich verdedigd het werd een opstootje waarbij een van hen henk een mes in zijn rug stak
9248848 ik kon geen woord uitbrengen toen me de uitspraak telefonisch werd meegedeeld ik was verlamd van mijn gezicht tot mijn tenen het meest ergerlijke is dat mijn getuigenverklaring totaal niet heeft meegespeeld in het verhaal volgens de rechter was henk de aanstichter van de ruzie en probeerde de dader zijn vrienden te ontzetten als je zoiets wilt doen dan hoef je toch niet iemand neer te steken maar goed dat kan allemaal ongestraft
9248849 als ik naar mijn vader ga daar in de wijk rij ik om ik ga naar een andere supermarkt ik wil die gasten niet tegenkomen anders word ik gek en sta ik niet voor mezelf in maar ik probeer me te beheersen

9248854 in combinatie met zweet urine en cosmetische producten als gel ontstaan er in chloorzwembaden irriterende stoffen die wij aoxen noemen
9248855 er is echter nog geen goed alternatief voor chloor daarom starten we begin 2009 met een onderzoek dat moet uitwijzen of er betere manieren bestaan om publieke baden te zuiveren
9248856 voor het ontsmetten van drinkwater wordt uv in nederland al op grote schaal gebruikt bacteri n gaan kapot wanneer ze langs dit soort lampen worden geleid we moeten alleen nog maar een manier verzinnen om al het water dat in een zwembad zit op praktische wijze langs de lampen te laten stromen
9248857 het is in nederland verplicht om chloor aan het zwemwater toe te voegen mocht ik een beter reinigingsmiddel vinden dan moet de wet worden aangepast zon wetswijziging is een uitputtingsslag
9248858 twintig procent geeft aan niet te douchen voordat ze het bad in plonzen uit mijn eerdere onderzoek blijkt echter dat als ze vijftien seconden zouden douchen ze vijftig procent schoner zijn en er minder chloor in het water hoeft te worden gedaan

9248865 el caso del aeropuerto es escandaloso comenta uno de los taxistas no respetan ni los espacios de estacionamiento destinados s lo a taxis
9248866 aparecen cada d a que hay ferry a or n afirma uno de los taxistas los lunes mi rcoles y viernes un servicio que corre de boca en boca
9248867 en esos casos los vigilantes del puerto les piden que se identifiquen y que digan a quien van a recoger pero siempre dicen que a sus familiares explica otro de los profesionales s lo a veces comprueban la documentaci n y ven que no son familia
9248868 es bueno que de vez en cuando nos recuerden cu les son los conceptos importantes porque muchas veces en el ejercicio de la pr ctica diaria entramos en la rutina y las olvidamos

9248879 tras el reconocimiento ileg timo de kosovo todos esperaban que reconoci ramos abjasia y osetia del sur no lo hicimos y nos tragamos el reconocimiento de kosovo lo que recibimos a cambio fue una escalada del conflicto
9248880 crimea no es un territorio de crisis no ha habido conflictos tnicos a diferencia de abjasia y osetia del sur

9248888 ahora nos piden que paguemos diez millones m s por recibir el mismo servicio que antes y ganar lo mismo
9248889 a medio plazo puede ocurrir que alcancemos unos costes de producci n que no sean sostenibles lo que dejar a fuera del mercado a muchas f bricas porque ya no ser n competitivas nos plantean pagar o cerrar
9248890 ellos se justifican en la crisis que afecta a todos los sectores econ micos pero no creemos que les cueste tanto producir la energ a como dicen
9248891 el error del gobierno al liberalizar el coste de la energ a porque as es como las cuatro compa as que tienen el monopolio pactan subidas tan absurdas como sta

9248898 they could not remember his specific views from that era beyond a general emphasis on diversity and social and economic justice
9248899 the 2008 election is almost certainly going to be decided by white lower middle class voters the people who voted for hillary clinton this year and before that for ronald reagan if these voters dont swing behind the obama candidacy in ohio michigan florida and missouri he will lose yet amid a universally described lack of clarity about sen obamas experience and core political beliefs it is now being said that if the people in blue collar counties dont vote for him they and their nation remain racist this is false if they dont vote for barack obama it wont be over his personal roots but because theyre confused about the roots of his politics

9248904 he also stressed that hed chosen biden because he can step in and become president even as mccain aides suggest that palin will learn at mccains knee as long as she isnt called to serve too soon
9248905 women voting for this ticket is just like chickens voting for colonel sanders

9248918 both volcanism and meteorites have the same isotopic signature but we now know from our analysis of deposits that what caused the dinosaurs to die off did not cause this
9248919 if this event were to happen today the effects would be seen much faster because there is more mixing between the top and bottom layers of the ocean
9248920 carbon dioxide concentrations of the ocean and the atmosphere dropped because of this huge burial of organic carbon the surface temperatures dipped as well so it was like a global cooling with the passage of time though the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations went back to their original levels and the temperatures also increased
9248921 a lot of people think its okay to pump more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere they rationalize that because of this there will be more carbon dioxide in the ocean and so an increase in plant life like an acceleration of the natural cycle
9248922 this organic matter would take up the extra carbon dioxide and then be buried at the bottom of the ocean that might happen that might not happen but we dont want to be around to actually try it
9248923 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9248924 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
9248925 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
9248926 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
9248927 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
9248928 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer
9248929 whats emerging from studies in cancer chemoprevention is that using single compounds alone is not enough
9248930 and berries are not enough we never get 100 percent tumor inhibition with berries so we need to think about another food that we can add to them that will boost the chemopreventive activities of berries alone
9248931 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9248932 one of the biggest challenges in regenerative medicine is to have a graded continuous interface because anatomically thats how the majority of tissues appear and there are studies that strongly suggest that the graded interface provides better integration and load transfer
9248933 every organ in our body is made up of complex heterogeneous structures so the ability to engineer tissues that more closely mimic these natural architectures is a critical challenge for the next wave of tissue engineering

9248940 the unrestrained greed of the us leadership and global zionism is gradually leading the world to the edge of a precipice
9248941 it is evident that if such a challenge occurs the fake and artificial regimes will be eliminated before anything
9248942 some of the equipment of our armed forces have been announced but there are important things hidden whose effect would be shown on the day of any attack

9248947 it was after the full horrors of nazi germany had been revealed that western christianity realized that promoting anti semitism la the protocols of the elders of zion could be seen as sympathizing with the nazis so those fundamentalists who were blatantly anti semitic backed up and regrouped
9248948 american scientists have declared that in ten years they will succeed in creating a radically new type of biological weapon this weapon would be capable of infecting people according to a genetically predetermined marker such as skin color or eye shape infection could have a delayed effect or only begin once a certain type of medicine was taken a recent closed seminar held by the cia was devoted to the topic the event took place as part of the project for the new american century
9248949 there is one more reason that is raised as to why this kind of biological weapon is unlikely to be as effective as the ideologues would wish
9248950 over the many years of human existence ethnic groups have intermingled to such an extent that the genetic structures determining ethnic identity have blurred and become difficult to recognize

9248957 some of the biggest men in the united states in the field of commerce and manufacture are afraid of something they know that there is a power somewhere so organized so subtle so watchful so interlocked so complete so pervasive that they better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it
9248958 the real truth of the matter is as you and i know that a financial element in the larger centers has owned the government ever since the days of andrew jackson
9248959 there exists in our nation today a powerful and dangerous secret cult the cult of intelligence its holy men are the clandestine professionals of the central intelligence agency its patrons and protectors are the highest officials of the federal government its membership extending far beyond governmental circles reaches into the power centers of industry commerce finance and labor its friends are many in the areas of important public influence the academic world and the communications media the cult of intelligence is a secret fraternity of the american political aristocracy

9248973 it was foreseeable that conduct that would ordinarily be indisputably seriously criminal would be implemented by military officials responsible for detaining and interrogating suspected enemy combatants

9249129 so captain is it the dimension wall that is a problem if so i have the right knowledge of taking care of that problem
9249130 why have you shown us these photos what do these two have to do with anything
9249131 the two of them are who could jeopardize our whole mission they must be taken care of before we can do anything the animal is a hedgehog by the name of sonic and the man wearing blue and red is called mario
9249132 your joking right cap you think these two can stand in the way of our army of seven billion
9249133 as i said before the two of them are just a minor threat but everything will run smoothly if they are both out of the picture a great advantage to us is the two of them have never met nor are on the same planet
9249134 im going to send them to the phortex8w theres no possible way they can get out
9249135 what about the species of each planet its not like they will just sit there and go along with us taking over what will be our strategy we need one if we want things to turn out perfect
9249136 earth will be the easiest to complete our mission given the fact we look just like the humans they wont be able to notice a difference ive already sent a few of our experts to dispose of mario and sonic
9249137 hello you have reached the residence of the mario brothers how may i help you
9249138 this is mr cain i believe the two of you did some plumbing for me last week well anyway the pipes in my basement are still leaking the two of you need to get back over here right now and fix it

9249142 i dont know how i continue to forget its just we have been so busy lately but i will check it out mama mia luigi slow down its a red light
9249143 i wonder what kind of cake she will have man i cant wait im glad the princess is finally getting married on top of that prince james seems like a really nice guy
9249144 i agree with you one hundred im just wondering why we havent heard from mario and luigi yet she sent them an invitation to the wedding a few weeks ago its so strange they have not been to the mushroom kingdom in over a year and a half
9249145 im positive the two of them will be here soon i cant wait it sure will be nice to see them again
9249146 im doing great but i cant wait to meet all of your family tomorrow
9249147 so will i get the chance of meeting the famous mario and luigi everyone speaks of them in your kingdom
9249148 i hope so but i havent heard back from them yet the wedding is tomorrow so chances are they wont be there
9249149 even if they dont attend i will make it a wedding you will never forget
9249150 we have to fix this place up nice this is where the reception will be held
9249151 what if luigi doesnt come wouldnt that be a little unnecessary to hold this thing here
9249152 it doesnt matter if he comes or not we arent changing plans at the last minute
9249153 i heard rumors they will be taking there honey moon to isle delfino im still so happy she has found a man she will spend the rest of her life with
9249154 i dont know but i always thought there was something special between them i guess maybe it just wasnt meant to be
9249155 who are you talking about youre not making much sense at all
9249156 maybe there was a spark between them but it was more of a friendship mario and luigi will always be close friends to her just like they are to us
9249157 if you think about it maybe that is the reason we havent heard from them yet the fact she is getting married could have been too much for them to take in
9249158 are you serious they wouldnt miss this for the world in my opinion they are probably surprising us and will come at the last minute
9249159 hey toad could you come inside for a minute i have a few things i would like to discuss
9249160 no problem james ill be right in ill see you later yoshi
9249161 thanks a lot for coming out you two im sorry i demanded that you come out this early but it really needed to be fixed
9249162 no problemo we are happy to be of assistance call us back if you are still having problems
9249163 i will have your checks sent to you by mail you can expect it in a day or two
9249164 so would you like to stop by our favorite coffee shop
9249165 that sounds like a superb idea plus i need something to boost my energy a bit
9249166 oh hello luigi and mario its nice to see your faces again so what can i get for you today
9249167 im glad to see you as well this is one of the best diners in brooklyn
9249168 we will take two iced coffees and two orders of four stacked pan cakes
9249169 you can take your time betty we will most likely be staying a while
9249170 business has been going well lately we have pulled in some good customers
9249171 its a good thing it is last month we hardly had any customers if we save up enough money we can buy ourselves a new truck
9249172 i dont know why we avoided this place for so long
9249173 is there anywhere you would like to go before heading home
9249174 what is it that you want none of this makes sense and i know someone sent you so tell me
9249175 what do you know about mario hes just an average man like everyone else
9249176 i know nothing about him or even this planet but ive got orders to follow mario must be sent to the phortex8w i suggest you get lost or your fate could be similar
9249177 this could have been done the easy way had you stayed out of my way
9249178 youre much tougher than i thought but this little show is over
9249179 now what am i supposed to do where do i go from here
9249180 it looks like mario has been taken care of everything is going well so far the hedgehog is the last of important matters we must deal with before pulling forward im not saying it will be a walk in the park with the two of them gone but it will make things much easier
9249181 so is there anyone on the way to eliminate the speedster yet
9249182 sonic is even more tricky than mario i sent a few troops of ours to deal with him but that should be none of your focuses i want you all to prepare for our upcoming invasion of the worlds
9249183 yes sir we will do that is there anything we can do for you in the meantime
9249184 there will be nothing else that any of you will have to do

9249195 if nato suddenly takes military actions against abkhazia and south ossetia acting solely in support of tbilisi this will mean a declaration of war on russia
9249196 tensions between russia and the west were ratcheted even higher today after moscow warned that the american naval build up in the black sea could be seen as a declaration of war
9249197 normally battleships do not deliver aid and this is battleship diplomacy this does not make the situation more stable
9249198 despite the apparent strength of the nato naval group in the black sea a single salvo from the moskva missile cruiser and two or thee missile boats would be enough to annihilate the entire group within twenty minutes the waters would be clear

9249247 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
9249248 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
9249249 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
9249250 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
9249251 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
9249252 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
9249253 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
9249254 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
9249255 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
9249256 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
9249257 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
9249258 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
9249259 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
9249260 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca
9249261 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
9249262 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
9249263 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
9249264 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
9249265 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
9249266 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
9249267 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
9249268 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
9249269 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
9249270 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
9249271 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
9249272 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
9249273 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
9249274 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
9249275 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
9249276 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
9249277 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
9249278 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
9249279 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
9249280 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family

9249308 robert burns one of the most famous poets and songwriters ever known around the world called scotlands favourite son and who ask who he is honestly what did they teach you in that school of yours
9249309 he wrote many poems lots of them famous he became known as the scottish bard and he wrote songs too auld lang syne was one of his yknow
9249310 he was an astonishing man you know he was born one of seven kids and worked on a farm his dad taught him at home and he learnt reading writing arithmetic geography and history him and his brother then learnt french latin grammar and mathematics from a man in the parish got to have a bit of mathematics
9249311 imagine that going from an ordinary life on a farm to being known throughout this country
9249312 people knew of him right across scotland even though hed been taught by his father
9249313 right across the world burns night is held in his honour on the 25th january people gather round say the selkirk grace then comes the piping and the cutting of the haggis where burns famous address to a haggis is read and the haggis is served its more widely celebrated than scotlands official national day you know
9249314 mmm a woman called jean armour and possibly a mary campbell he was a bit of a womaniser to be honest he had several children by various women but he was a good man
9249315 how did he die then did the women kill him mum says she knew someone who had a friend whose cousin heard that their friend was killed coz the ex girlfriends all got jealous
9249316 so come on then if it wasnt the ex girlfriends what was it
9249317 his death was caused by the bacterial endocarditis exacerbated by a streptococcal infection reaching his blood following a dental extraction in winter 1795 and no doubt further affected by the three months of famine culminating in the dumfries food riots of march 1796
9249318 he died on july 21st 1796 when he was 37 his funeral took place the day his son was born and a memorial edition of his poems was published to raise money for his wife and kids and money started pouring in to help

9249415 doctor there are hundreds of these things out there in this city
9249416 in groups they dont like being alone they shouldnt be locked up
9249417 we have to lock em up they live in the sewers generally weve had weevils in cardiff for a good thirty years
9249418 theyre called granularians or thats the closest approximation youd understand theyre from a planet fifty six million light years from here a younger planet than yours theyre still evolving barely learned to walk and here you have them locked away in a cell
9249419 thats what we do here doctor we keep the city safe
9249420 ill take them off your hands theres room in the tardis for as many as you can round up ill take them back home
9249421 home eh how about that you can roam the grasslands with the rest of your people
9249422 youve got enough equipment here not to mention what ive got in the tardis to build a transmitter well bring them to us put them in the tardis ill get the old girl to fit out a room for them and off we fly youre not keeping them locked up any longer jack
9249423 oh yeah theres no point trying to stop him either he doesnt do orders
9249424 i could do with the help and anyway dont you think they earned it
9249425 mickey martha the doctors got a bee in his bonnet about weevils and were off to the tardis
9249426 welcome to the tardis time and relative dimension in space the best ship in the universe
9249427 this things huge i dont think ive seen half of it lets try the wardrobe for starters
9249428 were getting there ianto would you make us some coffee
9249429 no but thats all just looks isnt it hes really alien you can tell he just thinks differently from us
9249430 im not stupid and anyway jacks not a one man one being bloke ive always known that but do you think the doctor knows
9249431 yeah but he wont tell jack he knows and he wouldnt do anything about it
9249432 ive been talking to martha she says hes useless at relationships thats why she left him
9249433 he runs everywhere remember chasing margaret blaine when we were here before doc
9249434 the mayor the one who died in the earthquake a few years back
9249435 took her back home gave her a fresh start quite a lot of running that day
9249436 linearly speaking you were still in london i had suzie and owen and tosh here on lockdown because i didnt want them running into me haring after the doctor up above
9249437 i remember the news reports now we all reckoned it was aliens back in london mam and dad believed the earthquake story though
9249438 one of many fine pieces of government misinformation put about in the past few years
9249439 hallucinogens in the water mass hypnotism really i dont get why people believe that but wouldnt believe the truth
9249440 though they made it sound like she was working secretly for the government havent mentioned the copper foundation at all
9249441 the which foundation copper mr copper short white hair native of sto
9249442 he came to our attention when he started spending money we put him in touch with harriet jones when we found out he knew you after that it was all them he funded the subwave network
9249443 no better than good brilliant thanks for not locking him up jack
9249444 and your weevils would be harmless if you didnt antagonise them cant go by appearances
9249445 yup working fine just got to set it to the right frequency
9249446 and take it outside too much interference in here come on
9249447 no point scaring the populace theyll be scared enough when the weevils come now
9249448 and shes set up a passage to the safe room shes set up
9249449 you look after the aliens doctor well look after the humans gwen give the police a call tell em not to worry about the weevils peoplell panic ianto put the ambulance service on standby in case they get violent
9249450 we owe him several and well pay the debt back in full next time theres an invasion
9249451 all right do your worst doctor if this thing blows up im blaming you
9249452 must be outside your range of hearing its signalling all right
9249453 back up next to the tardis and here they come
9249454 a shipload of granularians and a flight to freedom whos coming jack martha mickety mick mickey
9249455 you bring us back to the here and now doctor
9249456 he knows about torchwood and aliens and that but i dont think hed cope very well with travelling in space ill tell him when we get back so wed better get back
9249457 granularia a world thats not what youd call particularly hospitable to humans but not uninhabitable home to your weevils and a bunch of other primitive lifeforms barely sentient really but harmless enough were
9249458 how about the present bit barren i suppose but look at those stars
9249459 barely anywhere left on earth with a view like that
9249460 quite a lot of earth covered by big emptiness no pollution
9249461 all gone ill leave you the transmitter jack you can round them up occasionally give me a call when your cells are full and ill fetch them for you ill have a look at the rift too see if i cant close the gap between this world and the earth
9249462 well in theory though ive often found theory to be somewhat flawed but thats my problem times always my problem and right now i think its time for a proper meal what do you say jack how about that little place on fantasma five
9249463 thats the one cant beat a good canap i always say i can still get you all back whenever you need to be back so that gwens bloke doesnt fret at least
9249464 that moment when you and rose arrived i was all set to go up in flames with my cocktail and there you are dancing
9249465 theres a tray in the second cupboard on the left
9249466 im useless with coffee anyway ask anyone nah im here to tell you he wont come with me
9249467 theres no point its you he wants torchwood you gwen cardiff
9249468 he abandoned us for you before he went flying off to you when the daleks arrived third times a charm
9249469 oooh ive never liked that particular saying relies a bit too much on superstition
9249470 hell help if i need him and i know ill always be able to rely on that
9249471 emphasis on always and thats the problem jacks wrong ianto hes a fixed point and that bothers me gets me up here
9249472 i owe him oh so much and hes sacrificed more than even you will know what he wants now what he needs now really is a fixed point of his own thats you ianto and torchwood hell never need me the way he needs you im not going to take that from him
9249473 i rather think its me that should be thanking you we needed that rift and if you and gwen hadnt been handy the earth would be stuck in the medusa cascade for all eternity ianto jones saviour of the universe
9249474 but it was already too late she was full of heart gwyneth just wanted to do the right thing and she did saved the world
9249475 and bang on time well just a couple of hours after we left anyway eleven oclock
9249476 martha mickey ianto ill see you guys back in the hub
9249477 but if not ill just hassle the doctor by phone until he does have a good night
9249478 ive seen the universe been to the end of it with the doctor ill get a chance to see it again
9249479 you can trust him ianto and you can trust me i wont leave you
9249480 i wish he wouldnt mend my teleport didnt matter how much i begged
9249481 i might not wear pinstripes and trainers like he does but there are some things i think i can do better
9249482 this step is biased and aimed at justifying the aggressive actions of georgia
9249483 i dont think the contemporary west has any means to punish a state that is not quite a rogue state
9249484 the kremlin didnt take tbilisi and didnt shoot mikheil saakashvili expelling russia from the g8 or the world trade organisation isnt important
9249485 i think they are watching very closely to see what will happen at the eu summit
9249486 but i think the kremlin calculation is that the eu wont react seriously
9249487 the characters anthony carmine minh young kim and general raam will these be characters in the campaign or for multiplayer only
9249488 gears of war 2 that carmine is in fact his brother benjamin
9249489 inexperimentada t sarah no no como t claro si yo estaba hablando de los otros inexperimentados los otros
9249490 i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day
9249491 ive been so focused on state government i havent really focused much on the war in iraq
9249492 s tu mismo la soluci n y el mundo que t quieres para los dem s

9249501 music gives some inkling of landscape the sheer scale of orchestral music the volume and the detail can put me in touch with something much bigger than myself take me beyond my personal boundaries the world that i experience with my fingertips or my cane music tells me there is a wider world and what it might be like
9249502 emily post entered the world only seven years after americas civil war end though most of her family sided with the union a few renegade relatives fought with the south the staunch loyalists who survived spinning heroic stories of general lee and his horse traveller throughout their lives at the time of emilys birth in baltimore women were being jailed for promoting birth control for married couples when she died in new york city women and men married or not were campaigning for legalized abortion a few years before her funeral befuddled but fascinated even now by the latest technology that celebrated the ingenuity of the age she would watch on television the launch of sputnik
9249503 there was sadness in everything in the room in the ringing bird calls from the garden in the lit golden lawn beyond the window with its single miraculous cherry tree breaking in immaculate blossom and tossing long foamy sprays against the sky she was sad to the verge of tears and yet the sorrow was rich a suffocating joy
9249504 oh roddy if only theyre so brief i wish they were never quenched but went on falling and falling so lovely for ever would you be content to burst into life and be a ten second marvel and then vanish

9249507 grab what you can were leaving and never coming back
9249508 i think ill live in poverty or marry someone who will beat me or maybe i should be a drug addict or alchoholic or i bet id make a great serial killer
9249509 everything changes and evolves and weve got to get with it embrace it and find a way to make it work
9249510 we may not be the coolest people in the world but we have some genuine feelings and if a feeling is genuine it has value whether its sentimental or not
9249511 mysterious skin was the story of suburban teenagers trying to figure out how to be sexual beings whilst hiding dark terrible secrets thumbsucker is the story of suburban teenagers trying to figure out how to be sexual beings when their desires alone feel like dark terrible secrets its not hard to turn tragedy into comedy a stroke of the mundane is all it takes
9249512 why then are up and down not reversed as well
9249513 can you believe that i found the word boobies in national geographic
9249514 you know that it is actually the name of a bird right
9249515 yes hell die in office and then well have her you nasty old wife beating patriot you
9249516 shes a fresh new face in a party thats dying for one the antidote to boring white men
9249517 i think were going to have to examine our tag line dangerously inexperienced
9249518 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
9249519 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
9249520 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
9249521 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
9249522 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
9249523 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
9249524 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
9249525 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
9249526 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
9249527 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
9249528 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
9249529 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
9249530 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
9249531 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
9249532 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
9249533 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
9249534 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
9249535 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
9249536 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
9249537 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
9249538 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
9249539 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
9249540 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
9249541 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
9249542 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
9249543 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
9249544 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
9249545 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
9249546 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
9249547 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
9249548 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
9249549 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
9249550 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
9249551 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
9249552 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
9249553 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
9249554 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
9249555 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh

9249591 the beginning of a couples supposedly lifetime commitment to each other is juxtaposed with the near end by death of another couples
9249592 congratulations lynn you officially win for having the most incredibly predictable final line in any comic strip movie or tv show ever
9249593 if i pulled this in any of my writing classes id get
9249594 lynns goodbye message will just make it a hundred times more lame when six months from now she changes her mind again and returns the strip to real time hopefully by then it will be running exclusively in upstate ny bee newspapers
9249595 one thing i was often asked was to tell more about folks such as anthonys parents but there were so many characters and only one statement a day less than 30 seconds to try and tell a story i just hoped you would make up your own minds as to how these distant players fit in with that said i have now let all of this pass into the mist as the story ends and i return to the beginning for better or for worse begins again on september the 1st with new material new art and new enthusiasm without the need to visit all of the auxiliary characters i can concentrate once again on the insular little patterson household i have the children all to myself again i can do spot gags and silly stuff i can fix what i dont like about my early work as i add and subtract redraw and just improve everything
9249596 so shes too old and befuddled to keep track of her own more complex characters storylines and design layouts
9249597 maybe we should get weird al to do a new parody of
9249598 syndicates and newspapers are ridiculously stupid they stubbornly cling to the comic strips that used to be good and used to bring in money while turning away the newer generation of artists and saying
9249599 so if lynn is going to re tell the story but this time without auxiliary characters does that mean michael and elizabeth will end up having to marry each other
9249600 it is interesting that lynn is so self absorbed in her strip yet doesnt use the situations in her real life to color her strip as she used to in the past
9249601 one of the great mysteries of how this strip ended is elly not going to see her father wtf is up with that
9249602 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
9249603 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
9249604 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
9249605 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
9249606 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
9249607 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
9249608 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
9249609 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
9249610 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
9249611 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
9249612 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
9249613 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
9249614 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
9249615 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
9249616 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
9249617 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
9249618 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
9249619 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
9249620 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
9249621 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
9249622 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
9249623 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
9249624 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
9249625 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
9249626 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
9249627 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
9249628 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
9249629 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
9249630 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
9249631 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
9249632 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
9249633 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
9249634 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
9249635 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
9249636 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
9249637 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
9249638 distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers the state of the art
9249639 is it easy to determine whether a given integer is prime for small integers the answer is obviously yes but what about much larger integers if easy is defined as deterministic polynomial time then the answer is again yes as proven by agrawal kayal and saxena in a famous paper in 2002 but what happens when a polynomial time algorithm is too slow this talk will take a closer look at the state of the art analyzing the scalability of todays best algorithms and identifying the most important open problems in the area

9249641 the impact of side channel attacks on the design of cryptosystems
9249642 authors of cryptographic software have to go to extra effort to protect themselves against cache timing attacks branch prediction attacks and other side channel attacks the extra effort depends on the cryptosystem side channel resistance often makes an otherwise attractive cryptosystem end up consuming far more resources than the system designer had originally expected this talk will explain how to write cryptographic software that keeps secret information safely away from all known software side channels and how to design cryptosystems that remain efficient when they are implemented in this way examples will be drawn from several areas of secret key and public key cryptography

9249672 based on our game last week we were never going to do much damage playing like that
9249673 i think if we play like we did tonight we can certainly do some damage
9249674 every team bar probably the top two geelong and hawthorn have had really up and down seasons
9249675 so its good to be in the finals youre in the mix teams have had reasonable form and then down patches and weve be exactly the same as probably six teams in the final eight so hopefully we can play as well as we did tonight
9249676 im here to apologise firstly to our supporters and secondly to shannon grants family because that was a disgraceful effort today
9249677 it all comes down to effort required and it was non existent and that was one of the things we spoke about all week the effort
9249678 its a mental application and about your desire to work hard but that was non existent today
9249679 thats not like us and weve blown an opportunity to finish fourth but we have another opportunity and thats the important thing now
9249680 some of the guys who have served us so well have been on a bit of a slippery dip and some of the guys who performed poorly today and who performed poorly last week make themselves vulnerable
9249681 do we take them into a finals series probably not being match hardened
9249682 thats a question we have to really look very closely at and pick the best side to win a final
9249683 its important to be able to realign yourself refocus and get yourself ready but eight other sides would love to be sitting where we are right now
9249684 i suppose we could have maybe done that at the start to franklin but i suppose thats the way hes seen it
9249685 if he would have kicked it this game would have been replayed regardless of the score between the two teams
9249686 i dont think youll ever see two full forwards kick 100 goals on the same day in the same round it would have just been fantastic fairytale romance
9249687 you would have looked in 100 years time and said they have done it and they did do it in the same round
9249688 for the afl to get the two teams to play off in the last round and kick the 100 goals the stars are aligned it nearly happened its just a shame it didnt
9249689 i think theres a bit of romance hes played a lot of footy for carlton and hes won games off his own back
9249690 if we could go out of our way to maybe see if we could get him there for one quarter i think thats fair enough and we were that close
9249691 we were really pleased with our efforts for tonight weve been pretty impressed with the way carlton has gone about it for the bulk of this season and we were ready for a tussle tonight
9249692 it was a great opportunity for us to try and win a game of footy and get some momentum going into the finals so we were pleased to get the victory that we got
9249693 the guys were really determined to do well and we think winning form is good form that was a real focus for us
9249694 weve been in the bottom four for such a long time when you know youve gotten out of the bottom four youve won some games of football
9249695 whether the ledgers seven eight or 10 wins youve got out of there and played some half decent footy throughout the year
9249696 i think for matty kreuzer to play a big mans role and to play like a big man i think its a real credit to him to show how competitive he is
9249697 our performance today i think we really learned a lot from a team that really runs hard and theyre playing finals

9249700 i played great at the start of the year and then hurt my back and it took me about a month of rehab to get back into it
9249701 i missed some big tournaments and right now im just trying to secure my card and go home for the australian events
9249702 i put myself on the right side of the hole gave myself a lot of opportunities and capitalised on some of the putts although i still left some out there
9249703 i felt good all day and just kept making birdie after birdie after birdie and then on my back nine a couple of eagles really boosted the round
9249704 for a while there was certainly a chance of 59 although i had 59 on my mind once i made that second eagle it didnt affect my golf
9249705 at the start of the day i just wanted to make the cut to make sure i got into next week i got off to a good start and it snowballed from there
9249706 im disappointed about the 59 but im certainly not disappointed about leading
9249707 yes its confirmed we are going to mississippi in the morning
9249708 they need to know that theyre in our thoughts and prayers as this impending hurricane approaches
9249709 we pray to god that it will spare them and a minimum of loss that might result from this natural disaster
9249710 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a national disaster
9249711 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers
9249712 ive instructed my senate staff to monitor the situation closely
9249713 you know obviously were going to be each day seeing what happens and were praying for new orleans but we want to make sure that people are making all the necessary precautions
9249714 it is true that we are monitoring the situation of course and there is a chance we can change the schedule but at this time we have not made any changes
9249715 its with great pride and gratitude that i tell you i have found the right partner to help me stand up to those who have corrupted washington
9249716 there is about 500 kids diagnosed with childrens cancer every year in australia and of those 500 we have about three kids dying of childhood cancer every single week
9249717 we have to do more we have to keep the momentum for medical research going and we have to eventually solve that problem of those children dying
9249718 its one thing to be diagnosed with cancer when youre in your 40s or 50s as i was but its an entirely different thing when somebody young is diagnosed with cancer
9249719 those of us whove been diagnosed whove had a fair crack at life you can be a little more philosophical about it but the raw injustice of a young person with all of their life ahead of them is something different all together
9249720 but there are other kids out there in the community that are definitely worse off than jake
9249721 and if we can reach to them and tell them our story and just get it out there in the community and help the kids thats what its all about
9249722 what does this individual stand for what is his record in terms of accomplishment
9249723 senator obama what have you done and what have you run
9249724 when you look at those two questions the answer is not much and nothing
9249725 i am sure mccain is going to respond and i am sure he is going to respond to some of the things that he might take personally
9249726 there is no way that john mccains speech will be as good as barack obamas
9249727 republicans are hoping to make up for that disadvantage with the advantage that they have in going second
9249728 after all the hoopla over the democrats they can pull out a tough attack on democrats from tax and spend policies to national security
9249729 ive been around long enough to know that when the vultures are around it gets difficult
9249730 ive never had it before but you just have to deal with it id rather it was directed at me than the players
9249731 jermain was great the goals were two excellent bits of skill from a top class striker
9249732 we worked hard on our system all week and getting this result should give the players a lot of belief
9249733 gustav is forecast to remain a major hurricane through landfall along the northern gulf coast
9249734 really i just did not expect this it has been a long time since we have been hit by such a powerful hurricane and this gustav looks like it will be quite strong
9249735 it was a difficult fire to fight there were not many access points to get in
9249736 there was rubber and other textile manufacturing stuff producing heaps of smoke
9249737 i havent had a chance to talk to the owner yet but he is there this morning
9249738 the fires out now but there are hot spots to put out and we are demolishing the building to stop the structure collapsing

9249746 i dont own a cell phone or a pager i just hang around everyone i know all the time if someone wants to get a hold of me they just say mitch and i say what and turn my head slightly
9249747 the world is governed more by appearances than realities so that it is fully as necessary to seem to know something as to know it
9249748 unfortunately at this stage we have not been able to identify those people however we are reviewing cctv and reviewing a number of other avenues of inquiry
9249749 and if we identify those people and i hope we will well put them before the court
9249750 theres a suggestion that the party was organised through internet and through sms and we will be pursuing that

9249754 an important driving factor behind the increase in cosmetic and weight reduction surgery may well be the large number of reality television programs that focus on weight loss and radical appearance change
9249755 most programs focus on the few individuals who have the most dramatic changes in appearance thus exaggerating the likelihood of positive outcomes
9249756 complications infections and failed procedures are barely mentioned giving the impression that negative outcomes are rare
9249757 and the environments in which appearance medicine programs are filmed are often highly artificial as most people dont have access to the same level of resources equipment personal trainers and chefs
9249758 given the dissatisfaction that participants typically express about themselves and their lives at the programs commencement the extreme psychological pressure that is created during filming and the difficulty of maintaining rapid weight loss it would be surprising if all participants and their families walked away unscathed
9249759 your life is changing and you may feel that you dont have much control yet youre safe and taken care of during this time of change as you say goodbye to the old and hello to the new youll learn that change is a part of everyones life you may feel sad to say goodbye and you may feel afraid of what will happen in the future this card tells you that new friends are coming your way you arent alone though as you will always have old friends and current family members who love you and care about you so please tell them about your feelings change helps you let go of anything youve outgrown as you say goodbye to the past youll always keep the love and lessons youve learned safely within your heart theyre treasures that youll always keep through your life say hello to the new people places and events that are coming to you theres nothing to fear about your future its happy bright and will be lots of fun

9249794 control thou art a beast how do you speak of control you know how i have made you you are a beast a creature of instinct and passion all fierce joy and experience you must do as you are bound to you have your choices none shall take them from you but you must make them
9249795 but the choice you give me is impossible you tell me i must not betray the love i have that i must look after it well and not tarnish it and yet you tell me to experience everything to leave nothing undone so many in the past i have repelled pushed away in my effort to do as you ask now i have been played true and i lost but the game is not yet over
9249796 i want an end to this conflict i want no more pain
9249797 all this pain is yours and yours alone it has been served up to you by your destiny and there is no avoiding it to rid yourself of it you know your choices
9249798 i have called you here because i cannot make it
9249799 what weve done in the past is our road map to a championship
9249800 the letters in the soup went up to marthas brain instead of down to her stomach that evening martha spoke
9249801 what weve done in the past is our road map to a championship
9249802 the complexities of their situation are that it depends on them getting one in that one might well be bulgarian as i said all the way through the summer we need to be respectful of that and theres nothing i can do to force the situation if they do bring someone in i want to be at the front of the queue and i will do whatever it takes to bring campbell to the football club
9249803 there she was just a walkin down the street singing do wah diddy diddy dum diddy
9249804 barry ofarrell has suddenly pulled out of his back pocket an energy efficiency plan to justify his actions last week to justify actions that were very politically based and he knows it
9249805 our job now is to move ahead and to deal with the political decision making of barry ofarrell last week and implement a mini budget that still meets labors core commitment to our constituents
9249806 there is about 500 kids diagnosed with childrens cancer every year in australia and of those 500 we have about three kids dying of childhood cancer every single week
9249807 we have to do more we have to keep the momentum for medical research going and we have to eventually solve that problem of those children dying
9249808 its one thing to be diagnosed with cancer when youre in your 40s or 50s as i was but its an entirely different thing when somebody young is diagnosed with cancer
9249809 those of us whove been diagnosed whove had a fair crack at life you can be a little more philosophical about it but the raw injustice of a young person with all of their life ahead of them is something different all together
9249810 but there are other kids out there in the community that are definitely worse off than jake
9249811 and if we can reach to them and tell them our story and just get it out there in the community and help the kids thats what its all about
9249812 there have been plenty of highs and lows in my career and its been an honour to wear the springbok jersey
9249813 but it is time to go this has been coming for quite a while with the new laws and a new era in front of us with the way rugby is played and with a new coach peter de villiers it is the right time
9249814 i want to thank de villiers gary gold and dick muir the assistant boks coaches and the selectors for recalling me to the side after the world cup last year they gave me the opportunity to come back to south africa and play eight more tests and get to the 100 mark
9249815 we wish him well but we know his heart will always be in the change room
9249816 ive been around long enough to know that when the vultures are around it gets difficult
9249817 ive never had it before but you just have to deal with it id rather it was directed at me than the players
9249818 jermain was great the goals were two excellent bits of skill from a top class striker
9249819 we worked hard on our system all week and getting this result should give the players a lot of belief
9249820 yes its confirmed we are going to mississippi in the morning
9249821 they need to know that theyre in our thoughts and prayers as this impending hurricane approaches
9249822 we pray to god that it will spare them and a minimum of loss that might result from this natural disaster
9249823 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a national disaster
9249824 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers
9249825 ive instructed my senate staff to monitor the situation closely
9249826 you know obviously were going to be each day seeing what happens and were praying for new orleans but we want to make sure that people are making all the necessary precautions
9249827 it is true that we are monitoring the situation of course and there is a chance we can change the schedule but at this time we have not made any changes
9249828 its with great pride and gratitude that i tell you i have found the right partner to help me stand up to those who have corrupted washington
9249829 i played great at the start of the year and then hurt my back and it took me about a month of rehab to get back into it
9249830 i missed some big tournaments and right now im just trying to secure my card and go home for the australian events
9249831 i put myself on the right side of the hole gave myself a lot of opportunities and capitalised on some of the putts although i still left some out there
9249832 i felt good all day and just kept making birdie after birdie after birdie and then on my back nine a couple of eagles really boosted the round
9249833 for a while there was certainly a chance of 59 although i had 59 on my mind once i made that second eagle it didnt affect my golf
9249834 at the start of the day i just wanted to make the cut to make sure i got into next week i got off to a good start and it snowballed from there
9249835 im disappointed about the 59 but im certainly not disappointed about leading
9249836 what does this individual stand for what is his record in terms of accomplishment
9249837 senator obama what have you done and what have you run
9249838 when you look at those two questions the answer is not much and nothing
9249839 i am sure mccain is going to respond and i am sure he is going to respond to some of the things that he might take personally
9249840 there is no way that john mccains speech will be as good as barack obamas
9249841 republicans are hoping to make up for that disadvantage with the advantage that they have in going second
9249842 after all the hoopla over the democrats they can pull out a tough attack on democrats from tax and spend policies to national security
9249843 im waiting for someone to tell me what a veep does all day
9249844 how much time has senator mccain spent with gov palin
9249845 why would clinton backers want to vote for a woman who is against womens right to choose favors guns believes that evolution is wrong
9249846 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
9249847 they now know that they were used as decoys well after mccain had decided not to pick them
9249848 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9249849 she has never publicly demonstrated the kind of interest much less expertise in federal issues and foreign affairs that should mark a candidate for the second highest office in the land most people would acknowledge that regardless of her charm and good intentions palin is not ready for the top job mccain seems to have put his political interests ahead of the nations when he created the possibility that she might fill it
9249850 being governor of a small state for less than two years is not consistent with the normal criteria for determining whos of presidential caliber
9249851 i think she is the most inexperienced person on a major party ticket in modern history
9249852 the fact that he would have to go to somebody who is clearly unqualified to be president makes obama look like an elder statesman
9249853 she has foreign policy experience because alaska is so close to russia
9249854 weve got to do it all again in brisbane on friday night and it doesnt get harder than that
9249855 were not in the playoffs and the chances are well have to win next weekend to make it so weve got to get ready for that
9249856 i told the players to remind them in case they forgot what we did was celebrate bedsys retirement from the knights and farewell him and we celebrate our last home game
9249857 it took every ounce of us to beat melbourne and it probably will again next friday night
9249858 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9249859 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9249860 permission was not sought or granted nor would it have been given
9249861 i must tell you this is the mother of all storms
9249862 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving and out of new orleans right now
9249863 residents have the choice to remain behind and weather the storms
9249864 that would be one of the biggest mistakes that you could make in your life
9249865 last year we were trying not to lose and let the cubs catch us
9249866 this year our focus is to keep going ahead and win as many series as we can
9249867 every time we win its another day off the calendar
9249868 ive been throwing some quality innings you just want to give your team a chance
9249869 were grinding out the season and trying to get as many wins as we can its a different feeling than last year this team is different
9249870 its definitely satisfying to be able to contribute in many facets
9249871 weve been playing good baseball thats most important at this point of the season
9249872 when i knew sringsteen was going to be here there was no doubt i was going to be here
9249873 the p t a is great preparation for dealing with the k g b
9249874 now that georgias safe how bout i cook you up some caribou hot dogs and moose stew for dinner babe
9249875 we saw what we call an equivalent of neuroplasticity a change in brain activation that reflects the brains adaptability

9249877 it is up to me to integrate them into a harmonious visual statement i proceed through trials and errors it becomes an obsession and i do not stop until i have achieved my goal
9249878 that question was asked to me by bill oreilly i was like no we dont have the mediums that the kids nowadays do we didnt have paparazzi was i in a club at 16 smoking cigarettes taking a drink from people yeah i was i did the thing that normal kids do did i go to house parties and do keg stands and beer bongs thats what kids do i didnt live in a bubble but i was a normal kid nowadays these kids are trying to have an ounce of normalcy and they have a camera in their face should be interesting what one of my cast mates writes in his book you heard about that
9249879 one day however the people who created this civilisation completely vanished
9249880 but gahlas why would you start your own locked squad and invite certain folks then

9249885 this change in the convention program will allow thousands of first time participants a chance to take part i cant think of a better convention finale for our nominee who has made reaching out to voters a hallmark of his campaign
9249886 i think from a surface standpoint we have not won enough games
9249887 our goal is to put the organization in a position to play meaningful games in september and that is not happening this year
9249888 the reason we are in this is to win games any time you lose its frustrating were not accepting losing as part of the process we expect our guys to compete every night
9249889 we talked about changing the culture and we feel good about that
9249890 but we need to win more games we feel that is something that is coming
9249891 have reconfigured our top 15 prospects with 13 different names as we move forward infusion of talent was a goal we are pleased with where we are
9249892 there was a lot of comment made about it weve been there a few times throughout the course of the season we havent been able to get over the hump five hundred isnt anyones goal but its a goal on the way to better things it sure would be nice to get over that hump
9249893 only by people outside the organization nobody has been there for even half the seasons its not really on us but we certainly would like to end it
9249894 in 2007 dunkin donuts started partnering with the baseball team
9249895 it started as devil rays win you win this year its rays win you win when the team wins a game either at home or on the road go into any dunkin store in the tampa area and you receive one free doughnut just say to the cashier that the rays won and you get a free doughnut

9249935 i thought with my coaching substitutions we broke the rhythm twice in both halves and we got scored on both times doing that
9249936 with a two goal lead we should have put them away
9249937 its a tough place to play its a soccer school theyre a great team it would have been really easy to get down after two goals
9249938 it was a great run by nick brant who just carried it through the midfield beat a couple of defenders and slotted it through to me and i had the finish
9249939 we had so many chances and we just didnt put them away

9249953 can you expect that from us i dont know theres some guys that when they touch the ball and if you make a mistake they can score on you fun to watch
9249954 but its going to be hard not to have tebow carry the ball at certain times in the game its all to take the wear and tear off of tim and not to lean on him too much but we all know at the end of the day no 15 will carry the mail for us in critical situations
9249955 we have a little thing coach says in practice you put the money in the bank in games you get to take it out today was payday for us i knew we were going to come out do some big stuff i just got paid today

9249978 even floridians have decided that if its not visible over the horizon its ok the santa barbara board of supervisors in california recently approved drilling in the channel santa barbaras been the poster child for banning offshore drilling because of a spill 40 years ago and for the board to approve drilling is a big sea change the rockies and alaska are there but the big deal is offshore
9249979 think its better to produce our own oil than buy from hugo chavez i think the american people will demand a clean energy bill and i bet theres 300 votes in the house to drill the outer continental shelf
9249980 i do americans are waking up to the idea that were buying from people who dont like us if we have a choice of doing that or doing something else they say why not do something else
9249981 the democratic leadership has been forced at least in rhetoric to consider domestic drilling to be a viable alternative in answering our energy problems
