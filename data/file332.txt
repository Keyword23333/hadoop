3320000 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3320001 we are trying to be more efficient which means not do consultations that result in a difference for the species
3320002 when we pursue consultation in situations where the potential effects to a species are either unlikely incapable of being meaningfully evaluated wholly beneficial or pose only a remote risk of causing jeopardy to the species or its habitat
3320003 i spent as much time with cindy in washington and arizona as our jobs would allow
3320004 i was separated from carol but our divorce would not become final until february of 1980
3320005 it was like he was struck by cupids arrow he was just enormously smitten
3320006 i have a very good relationship with my first wife
3320007 my marriages collapse was attributable to my own selfishness and immaturity the blame was entirely mine
3320008 of course we will not comment on the breakup of the senators first marriage other than to note that the senator has always taken responsibility for it
3320009 john was turning 40 and wanting to be 25 again
3320010 it is a very emotive collection which includes this harrowing hand written account some of the details are quite shocking and brutal
3320011 pt haines daughter didnt have anyone to pass her fathers war collection onto so she came to us she was quite emotional after reading the document for the last time
3320012 we can discuss the question of a definitive settlement if two conditions are met
3320013 wir wollen die scharte auswetzen und in die bundesliga zur ck deshalb stellen wir uns dieser herausforderung unsere gr ten konkurrenten sind sicher die beiden anderen absteiger
3320014 allerdings hast du da immer noch ein zwei berraschungsteams die mitmischen
3320015 es ist damit zu rechnen dass sich 1860 stark verbessert
3320016 logischerweise sind diese teams ja immer favorisiert aber alle schaffen es nie
3320017 ich sehe keinen klaren favoriten sondern einen gro en kreis von neun oder zehn mannschaften dazu geh ren die absteiger mainz freiburg kaiserslautern f rth aachen sowie 1860 m nchen die entscheidung wird sp t fallen
3320018 ich sehe eine zweigeteilte liga mit je neun vereinen die um den aufstieg und gegen den abstieg k mpfen
3320019 wir haben eine gute truppe und wollen gas geben wir sind eine von sechs oder sieben mannschaften die aufsteigen k nnen und wollen
3320020 es werden die aufsteigen die am ende die ersten beiden pl tze belegen
3320021 a r ssia saca muito forte e tem o bloqueio bem mais pesado n o adianta querermos um embate f sico com eles vamos ter que jogar taticamente muito bem e planejar essa partida temos que entrar com o mesmo entusiasmo do jogo com a s rvia e atuar com mais intelig ncia t tica
3320022 hoje a gente entrou no clima da competi o era uma decis o e tinha todo um clima de recupera o que a gente precisa demonstrar
3320023 n o podemos disputar socos com eles que vamos perder precisamos de sabedoria e n o podemos querer enfrent los na for a eles tem uma capacidade f sica impressionante
3320024 quer amos passar uma imagem perfeita e pensamos no que seria melhor para a na o
3320025 era uma quest o de interesse nacional a crian a que apareceria diante das c meras tinha que ser expressiva
3320026 lin miaoke excelente para tudo isto por m no que diz respeito voz yang peiyi perfeita toda a equipe concordou
3320027 unprecedented demand this year has placed a major strain on the supply of tickets at all shows during the week and the surprise announcement of the black coffee debut will relieve some of this pressure fashion pundits have come to expect black coffee collections that are fashion forward and completely original
3320028 this is also exciting news for virgin mobile and adds to a long list of other impressive design talent showing
3320029 virgin mobile has a creamy history with black coffee as they designed the clothing range of our sassy advertising photography and we are always amazed by their level of creativity and attention to detail superlative stuff
3320030 its definitely being re rated and it should be re rated
3320031 by undertaking our first debt facility mumtalakat will be well placed to capture value creating acquisition opportunities when they arise
3320032 abbiamo inteso intervenire sul malessere esistente tra professionista ed utente nel momento in cui si affronta laspetto economico del rapporto
3320033 malessere legato alla contrazione economica generale e al fatto che spesso la pretesa dellavvocato viene messa in discussione dal cliente
3320034 in autunno metteremo gli istituti in concorrenza tra loro per ottenere il miglior risultato possibile
3320035 la nostra iniziativa non pensata solo per far incassare i soldi agli avvocati ma introduce anche unaltra importante novit
3320036 il consiglio dellordine infatti dar un parere sia sulla congruit della parcella sia sulla regolarit fiscale del rapporto cliente avvocato
3320037 pi morti sul lavoro o sulle strade che per omicidio
3320038 thats the signal people were waiting for things have fallen so low that we are about 50 cheaper than brazilian equity any blue chip right now is in huge demand even the oil stocks
3320039 its very positive news for the rouble because the georgian crisis was the only argument for the rouble weakness we saw in the last couple of days
3320040 with the crisis seemingly gone the rouble should recover from the losses it suffered something in the range of 29 35 40 versus the basket should be sensible if the news is correct and we really see an end of the crisis
3320041 opinions are divided over how china will do in individual events but it seems almost everyone expects at least 40 golds which is very optimistic
3320042 bisogna portare il proprio rotolo anzi si dovrebbe portare il proprio water per intero perch non c hanno soltanto una conduttura di scarico nel pavimento e basta
3320043 il water piatto e si trova a terra bisogna stare a gambe divaricate e davvero bassi per fare i propri affari
3320044 this is an intra upa affair we are attentive to the aspirations of different sections of supporting parties we are hopeful that the problem would be sorted out amicably within a week to the satisfaction of all concerned
3320045 for example indian based isp bharti telecoms tariffs in conjunction with others in the region mean that bundles in south and east asia are 43 cheaper than standalone
3320046 ultimately isps want customers and they want customers who generate revenue in particular they want growth in revenue to achieve this they are going to have to hook into all aspects of communication and data transfer whether its voice video or plain bits
3320047 a subscriber who takes more than one service from an isp is more likely to stay with that provider they are more likely to generate more revenue over their customer cycle than plain broadband subscribers and thats what the isps and their shareholders require
3320048 we took all the criteria distance access to public transport number of people using it deprivation indices and based on that all 11 of my local post offices will not be eligible for closure im confident
3320049 from what i know we will be able to stay open im delighted it has taken all the pressure off me so im more relaxed now im now waiting to see if i can get the land next door so i can expand
3320050 id be most surprised if they had closed this office but we are relieved that the uncertainty is now over
3320051 i dont know for definite yet but it looks ok i feel happy for the local people because if we close theyd have to get buses to other post offices its the pensioners that are really dependent on us
3320052 theres a lot of post offices in the country that i think will close
3320053 the imaging source ccd imager is a well designed versatile camera that is a natural progression for planetary astro photographers looking to upgrade from a consumer webcam the camera control software ic capture as seems to be a mature program itself complementing the camera perfectly
3320054 no other system can give people such a vibrant and immersive experience in public settings and were proud to provide the first chance for anyone to experience the only full body markerless technology
3320055 by eliminating the bodysuit we have taken motion capture out of the special effects studios where it was limited to animation and content creation and are bringing its benefits to everyone
3320056 the online retail market is fiercely competitive consumers expect to be able to shop quickly and easily even minor glitches in this process will lead customers to abandon their trolleys and go elsewhere
3320057 to maintain its leadership position next has recognised the importance of enhancing the experience of every online visitor and providing them with the same superior level of service as they would expect in store or through next directory
3320058 weve always felt that edinburghs potential as a sunday leisure and retail centre was and is a fantastic opportunity for us
3320059 no other city centre in the uk even europe matches scotlands capital for its unique environment and heritage
3320060 by introducing a month of sundays were reminding local people of just how much fun they can have on a sunday in the city centre at any time of year
3320061 we realise the work to bring a 21st century tram scheme to the city cannot be done without some disruption and we are doing all we can to minimise this
3320062 month of sundays has something for everyone and i am confident shoppers will be enticed into the city during those days
3320063 during his time at munters jonas has been a key member of the group management team and he has personally driven several successful strategic initiatives including several acquisitions jonas solid business understanding and drive have been highly appreciated throughout our group and we wish him the best of luck in his new role at electrolux
3320064 these executives are vital additions to our team who bring a remarkable breadth of collective experience and understanding of the dynamics that drive market acceptance of new payment solutions
3320065 they will ensure r v worldwide maintains the pace of innovation required to lead the market and fulfill our mission of delivering new payment solutions that will bring billions of underserved consumers into the financial mainstream
3320066 you cannot ask a rahul dravid sachin tendulkar sourav ganguly vvs laxman or anil kumble to prove their credentials
3320067 i think you should ask the selectors and the bcci this question i am happy with whatever they have in mind
3320068 i think it is just with time we should start winning in odis consistently we are a great team and we start doing well pretty soon
3320069 australia as a team is still far ahead yes we can beat australia and we have proved that but to do it consistently we have to improve a lot i think once we become more consistent we can think of being number one
3320070 everyone has to improve we have got good bowlers in the side and they are doing their best
3320071 not at all a player can be good in odis and tests and 20 20 as well look at virender sehwag or gautam gambhir
3320072 well i am a person who goes and thinks by my heart i do whatever my heart tells me to do i am not sure what man management is the team is like my own family i treat them the way a person will treat his own family
3320073 i think my team members were obviously there behind me other than that my family and friends are always behind me
3320074 an unqualified driver more than twice the limit driving at 50mph in a 30mph area is clearly dangerous driving
3320075 i think this decision to allow him to plead guilty to careless driving is pretty poor there has been a lot of criticism in recent years over excessive leniency in charges involving driving and this seems to be another example
3320076 careless driving suggests causing an accident through carelessness drinking then trying to escape from the police isnt careless its clearly dangerous im not pleased with the decision
3320077 i fully understand sheriff lothians concerns whilst the speed was not grossly excessive the circumstances still merited a dangerous driving charge
3320078 we will of course consider carefully the comments made by sheriff lothian in relation to this case the penalties for drink driving and dangerous driving are similar
3320079 in making his decision the depute fiscal weighed up the public interest in securing the certainty of a conviction and disqualification against the uncertainty of the outcome of a trial
3320080 local councils can find out the number and cause of avoidable contacts which is the first step to reducing them
3320081 the fact that simple transactions are increasingly satisfied by consumer self service internet and automatic voice response systems means person to person contacts tend to be more complex and take longer
3320082 reducing avoidable contact gives more capacity to handle unavoidable contacts more effectively and reduce overall workload
3320083 i wrote previously to the headmaster detailing a specific incident which involved youths drinking kicking bottles urinating and shouting at the top of their voices for the entire evening with no concern for the hour or for the distress they were causing to those around them
3320084 at times we have had groups play through until 4am
3320085 closing the playground would be a disaster in terms of local provision other schools in the city should follow their example
3320086 if they close this playground the kids will just have to go somewhere else i can understand their concerns if there are people playing late at night but this is only a small minority
3320087 the football pitches and basketball court were built as part of an initiative to give young people more recreational space to close it at night might be an extreme measure
3320088 the school feels that if they closed it at night the young people would still find some way of getting in
3320089 we were all stunned when we saw this bill and there has to have been a mistake somewhere
3320090 im not even sure if it would be possible for us to use that much electricity and it is even more surprising as we were told not too long ago we were overpaying
3320091 it seems staggering that they appear to have just come up with this figure out of nowhere the reference numbers they have given us for these two meters that were supposedly unpaid do not correspond to any meters here
3320092 what makes this worse is that all they will say to us is that we need to pay and that they can help us set up an instalment payment scheme
3320093 we have spoken to our solicitors and we want them to come down to the site and do a meter reading with us to clear this up
3320094 we are currently looking at the account involving the edinburgh masonic club and will be sending out an engineer to check the meters in the coming days
3320095 the operation to liberate kodori gorge has started our troops are making advances we are hoping for success
3320096 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3320097 there is of course a variety of other measures political or economic
3320098 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed in the minds of several us diplomats
3320099 our wine comes from europe so the euro affects it you have also got all the added fuel costs and the price of raw materials going up
3320100 theres no doubt that the credit crunch is affecting all products within the industry
3320101 its obviously something that is capable of inflicting a nasty injury but its not in the same category as a knife or an axe so im not going to consider custody
3320102 it was quite tricky i remember and did result in rather a lot of injuries
3320103 i learned to do it in about two weeks and then never used the skill again until my daughter was raising money to do charity work during her gap year
3320104 i decided to do the union canal which had just opened as the paths there are quite straight and smooth and i thought if i did crash into the water i would be able to swim
3320105 i managed it although i did pick up a lot of injuries
3320106 you need a relatively smooth straight path for this and it is too slow and dangerous to do on public roads so well just cycle normally there
3320107 ill be taking along plenty of repair equipment for the bike and for myself as i expect to fall off quite a few times
3320108 he said it was a fantastic idea as he said backwards cycling is the most efficient method because it cuts down on wind resistance
3320109 we have a number of serious concerns about the quality of care being delivered these have been raised both during our own inspections and as a result of complaints we have investigated
3320110 we are currently working extremely closely with the care home management with southern cross and with east lothian council to ensure improvements are made immediately
3320111 ive come on at night and found i was the only nurse on duty i was working with two young care assistants who had very little experience
3320112 following an inspection by the care commission ten days ago we were informed that seven requirements highlighted during a previous inspection have now been met and three partially met
3320113 we will continue working closely with the care commission and east lothian council to ensure the delivery of a quality service to all our residents
3320114 i have had contacts with representatives of those two clubs
3320115 they asked monaco about my situation and about the chance of transferring me so there is a possibility that an official offer could be made in the coming days
3320116 it is always good to be playing but we will have to see what happens at fulham with david now they have signed more strikers
3320117 i just wanted to be out on my own which i had done by the 100 metres mark that was my goal
3320118 i was out in open water and i was in the middle which makes it difficult for the other guys to see me
3320119 he walters is an ipswich town footballer on a three year deal we dont want to sell him we want to keep him
3320120 if stoke are showing serious intent in getting jon then they should do something about it if not they should leave alone and let us get on with it
3320121 a painstaking and thorough forensic examination is being carried out
3320122 house to house inquiries are continuing in the vicinity of the crime scene and the search of the scene is ongoing looking for possible weapons used in the attack
3320123 we are using chinese media outlets internet websites and community contacts to try and build up a lifestyle profile of the victims and identify the last sightings of the couple alive
3320124 do you know who i am i am the king of the beggars
3320125 he was on a bender on august 7 8 and 9
3320126 one of the elite group of active mathematicians in the world
3320127 we have always been criticised for too many tickets going to the fat cats
3320128 but we are confident that at least 80 in 2010 will go to the general public
3320129 it is in much the same way as you book a movie ticket by phone or online these days using your credit card and then when you get there you access your ticket through an atm type machine
3320130 it will take up to eight years to clean all the books in the library some of which date back to the 15th century
3320131 it is a real privilege to be handling these books
3320132 about 18 pakistan air force employees were travelling to the base when the bomb planted on the bridge went off
3320133 apparently it was an improvised explosive device that hit the bus
3320134 health and safety officers were inspecting the premises in relation to a variety of matters on february 9
3320135 they were dismayed to find fire exits at the property were blocked by a variety of items which raised very serious concerns
3320136 the items were temporary items that the company had attempted to remove
3320137 david beckham was one of the reasons we wanted to come to this game
3320138 david beckham brings class to the game in america he whips the ball in the mixer
3320139 i dont care as long as theyre here and as long as theyre watching the game
3320140 whether its because of my celebrity or whether they just want to see a soccer game its so important that people turn out and enjoy the game
3320141 david is to major league soccer in many ways what michael jordan was to the nba basketball or wayne gretzky was to the nhl hockey
3320142 when they go on the road the attendances are far higher and thats a good thing because more people are experimenting with soccer in america
3320143 our goal is not to beat the nfl or beat the nba our goal is to be a respected sport
3320144 there is no doubt in our mind that we will be a major major league in the united states at some point
3320145 its going well and thats obviously what this game needs in this country the hypes there weve got to keep it going
3320146 a lot of players still need to work on their own game and that means they cant think for the team so you have to start at the beginning
3320147 well be working with the police over longer time periods to make sure that the public are safe and that businesses are operating in a fair and professional manner
3320148 we had eight men on standby from early saturday afternoon dealing with extensive flooding issues
3320149 most of the flooding problems were localised and attended to successfully although four major floods resulted in roads having to be closed
3320150 a substantial number of sandbags were delivered to members of the public who requested them although there were no reports of flooded properties
3320151 there is no attempt being made to railroad this through
3320152 this whole exercise is whitewash and disguises the issue of car park charges as a survey about beach use
3320153 introducing beach parking fees is nothing but a stealth tax
3320154 residents are not going to go down to the beach for a shower so why should they be charged for these facilities
3320155 what we do here has major implications for how public services can be delivered in a new way across the uk i am talking about health centres parks housing and the lot
3320156 we have challenged old ways of working that create too much dependence on government
3320157 too much dependence on government and what happens when gordon brown turns the tap off
3320158 forget charity with social enterprise you think business and profit first community second without the enterprise there is no benefit to the community profits make people more self reliant
3320159 all of a sudden i felt like my world had collapsed around me
3320160 it was a summer from hell sometimes i didnt want to get out of bed i tried to be positive but you cant help asking why me
3320161 then i got the all clear its like the sun suddenly came out
3320162 these are sensational figures which show that trust in and support for the scottish government
3320163 coal is just about the dirtiest most inefficient fossil fuel there is
3320164 rbs is providing the financial means for companies to build new coal fired power stations which dont capture their carbon emissions and dig new mines all over the world yet still refuses to disclose full information on the fossil fuel projects it helps finance or to take any responsibility for the emissions that result

3320172 there are some things that really disconcert me one is the constant comparisons to my mother the journalists who write this dont ever step back and think how bizarre im comparing a 19 year old i have never met to her dead mother

3320176 we will file our defence in court a lot of the information in the article was from bangladeshi news reports anyway
3320177 i think it was more stressful than when i was doing my lifts said girard who saw pak struggle and fight but eventually clean and jerk 130 kilograms winning herself a gold medal and knocking the canadian to fourth place
3320178 i knew i had the chance to win the first medal for my country but i had nothing to do but wait
3320179 i was pretty close for the medal but im proud of what i did said the 23 year old native of elliott lake ont who attends university in rouyn noranda que
3320180 i did the best that i could thats it ill be back in four years and hopefully ill be on the podium in four years
3320181 i have a lot of respect for everyone in front of me said girard who comes from a weightlifting family and followed her sister caroline into the sport

3320183 if altantuya was wearing a black jacket throughout the night when she disappeared at which point did she decide that siruls jacket was more attractive and switched them
3320184 for dna profiling to be found on any article the person must have handled such article quite substantially and for a long time and not one of touch and go and mere handling it
3320185 it is impossible for someones dna profile to be found on one article without any contact unless it is so planted on that particular article
3320186 not knowing the history of the user of the yorn jacket primulapathi made the speculative conclusion that it must have been worn by the same donor of the dna found on the blood stain on the slippers the two tufts of hair and the watch and jewellery in the prosecutions version this is the victim altantuya
3320187 this chemist also did not say how long the victim would have to wear the jacket for it to be sufficient to leave her dna in those places neck and armpit regions
3320188 any person related maternally to the donor can deposit the said dna and scientifically we do not know the size of the dna pool that can contribute the same mtdna as there is no probative value of this
3320189 anyone from the same maternal lineage could share the same dna sequence the obvious example is namiraa gerelma who is the second cousin of altantuya from her grandmothers side
3320190 namiraas dna could have been deposited on the watch jewellery and even the jacket if she had touched them say when she was admiring the jewellery in the hotel
3320191 they in fact couldnt do that as their expertise was in the field of forensic pathology and anthropology respectively
3320192 however we do not know if this too had explosives residue because it was given to primulapathi before shaari tested it

3320199 jo jeg antar at vi p en m te kan si det

3320204 nei vi har ingen luktningsvedtekter her alt er pent i all evighet i himmelen og det samme gjelder arbeidstiden den er ogs evig

3320212 i norge har vi valgt en samfunnsmodell der vi finansierer de viktigste samfunnsoppgavene i fellesskap
3320213 det andre valget handler om hvorvidt vi skal l se oppgavene i fellesskap eller om den enkelte skal overlates mer til seg selv
3320214 et tredje veivalg handler om vi vil ha et organisert arbeidsliv og sikring av arbeidstakeres rettigheter eller om dette er rettigheter som skal bygges ned

3320216 the oil market doesnt seem to be very perturbed by the happenings in georgia there is a downward bias in the oil market that will continue for a little while
3320217 the crude prices in the near term look like trading in a range of 100 120 a barrel
3320218 continuing tightness in supply versus demand and tightness in spare capacity

3320223 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3320224 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one

3320232 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3320233 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3320234 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute

3320261 the vital thing to remember about interviewing is that you must listen to what the person is saying
3320262 if you are listening you can follow up a new line and perhaps get an even better story
3320263 it is for this reason that note taking must be a secondary occupation to listening
3320264 if what they say is brilliant dont be afraid to say sorry just a minute and then write it down and rephrase the question you had

3320273 national newspapers have poor bargaining power with advertisers due to intense competition and the rise of the internet where advertising at 19 of the uk total is the highest in the western world
3320274 the current cycle will punish johnstons local classifieds business though we see relative upside at the other end of this tunnel if regional newspapers can retain local higher priced advertising

3320278 the integration of infrastructure and food tracing solutions is complex and challenging
3320279 ibm was one of the key players involved in creating the epcis standards upon which the success of this project relies
3320280 we are therefore confident that ibm has the right technology and expertise for this project consumers are becoming increasingly aware of food quality safety origin and traceability this creates greater pressure on manufacturers to keep track of every component in the manufacturing process in order to ensure that their products are safe for the consumer ibm and matiq are developing solutions that will help ensure food safety on the consumers terms

3320285 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3320286 one is the sophisticated coordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3320287 if you look at the streets everything seems calm and peaceful
3320288 but behind it all the situation is different people are really angry

3320290 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored

3320320 the california supreme court has just confirmed what we all know in our hearts that lesbians and gay men in california have every right to marry the person they love
3320321 i support the rights of lesbians and gay men to marry and i am thrilled by the california supreme courts decision to affirm this fundamental right i pledge to vote no on any constitutional amendment to ban same sex marriage in
3320322 aberdeen fans can face the new season with a high degree of optimism one can never read too much into pre season friendlies but an astonishing reverse at the hands of the blue toon notwithstanding the lads have done fantastically well
3320323 a fine showing against the champions of europe and victory over dutch cracks vitesse arnhem suggests we have little to fear from anything the spl can throw at us
3320324 id also like to see nakamuras understudy mizuno warm a first team bench until he is required at pivotal moments of matches
3320325 this season could be the one where he demonstrates some real coaching talent perhaps we will realise that getting points away from home in europe doesnt have to be pretty
3320326 ive been attending the temple that is tannadice park for about 40 years im 50 and live in dundee
3320327 i attend virtually every home game and about half the away games i go to games with guys i have known for more years than i care to remember and my son sean aged 11 usually attends the games with me
3320328 im looking forward to the new season and am confident we can improve on last seasons fifth place pre season has gone well except for a 45 minute hammering by barcelona whizzkid lionel messi
3320329 its been a great boost to secure willo flood for another year and the new strikers of sandaza feeney and shala mean that noel hunt wont be missed too much
3320330 the loss of kalvenes was a blow but we have good cover for left back and i have been particularly impressed by the new signing scott robertson from the wee team across the road
3320331 at last the new season is about to get under way and everyone connected to the bairns is fired up and ready for a season
3320332 i hope john hughes and his backroom crew will lead the club to the next level and a top six finish
3320333 yogi has been a shrewd operator in the transfer market grabbing no fewer than 10 new faces to strengthen and expand our very youthful squad
3320334 the injection of experience in the form of neil mccann jackie mcnamara lee bullen and stevie lovell should lead to the consistency we have maybe lacked in the past
3320335 but one thing that will not change is the commitment to a flowing passing game but hopefully with an added killer touch in front of goal
3320336 at the core of the clubs continuing development is of course our own youth development policy
3320337 already we have seen the likes of darren barr scott arfield and tom scobbie breakthrough and gain international honours
3320338 and following on we seem to be brimming with potential so look out for chris mitchell keven moffat mark staunton and mark stewart to name just a few who may make the breakthrough into the first team
3320339 however its just as likely that we will struggle for the top 6 and who knows maybe even worse
3320340 its all very well hearing about the new togetherness within the squad but with no new striker to put the ball in the back of the net we will be left not killing off games like last season that we should have won one thing i know for certain is that this year is make or break for vladimir romanov in the eyes of many jambos contrary to what you read in the media the majority of us rightly or wrongly still hope that he can deliver and bring the good times back time nearly ran out for vlad last year but the general consensus is that we give him one more chance to get it right so to conclude what would represent a successful season well europe has to be the aim with the big cup back at tynie is it likely well my money is still firmly in my back pocket and the bookies arent getting near it this year
3320341 given that its the anniversary of dads army which member of the cast would be a stick on hibs supporter at least according to the scottish media
3320342 were doomed doomed yep an army of private frasers are at this moment shuffling along easter road hands in pockets kicking solitary pebbles into a dusty gutter
3320343 barcelona stuffed us middlesborough did us over after we surrendered a two goal lead wigan threw us off the end of the pier and as for cowdenbeath hibs played as if they were in a stock car heading downhill with no brakes no steering and murray walker commentating
3320344 the role of manager at easter road must be the most unenviable job in scotland sorry i forgot about the race for the leadership of the scottish labour party
3320345 do you know what i dont really care these are friendlies the manager shouldnt get panned for friendlies were not celtic
3320346 im happy to wait until the spl actually gets under way league results are all that count
3320347 the season ahead is our most challenging we need to get off to a good start and i think that the opening fixtures give us opportunity to do that
3320348 im confident we will carry a good scoring threat this season it was a blow to lose striker marius niculae but one player does not make a team and weve recovered from losing important players in the past like darren dods and midfielder john rankin
3320349 who knows perhaps the next marius niculae is just round the corner in any case caley fans have high hopes for new signing andy barrowman this season
3320350 id still like to see manager craig brewster make a few more signings before the transfer window closes our backline needs strengthening
3320351 the squad at inverness has always been very close knit team and they gel very early weve also had one of our best ever pre seasons so im optimistic about the new season
3320352 success would be a top six finish craig brewster is about to begin his first full season in charge at the club hes still relatively new to management and if he gets backing from the board he can do well
3320353 hell be aiming for a top six finish and come the split i dont think well be far away
3320354 if last season is anything to go by then any place above eleventh can be construed as a moral victory this time out
3320355 traditionally killie seem to operate in three year cycles so now our bad year is out of the way we can hopefully look forward to a couple of good seasons and boy do we need it
3320356 the money situation as always will dictate a lot of what happens down rugby park way this term but im well aware that we are not the only club who are struggling financially so we have as good a chance as any of the other teams out with the old firm of doing some damage
3320357 we had real problems with injuries and a lack of squad depth but the gaffer seems to be trying to address that situation by making a few summer signings
3320358 the fans are delighted that mehdi taouil has extended his contract as the wee man is a joy to watch and with craig bryson due back to full fitness after his operation we can look forward to a lot more from the midfield area
3320359 pascali will give us some much needed bite in front of the defence and up front we have introduced a man that will have the headline writers jumping for joy conor sammon
3320360 i have the feeling that jj is not finished yet and we may well see a few more new faces at the theatre of pies before the curtain raises against the hibees
3320361 all we need now is some news that a major investor has been found and we can have a board of directors to steer the club once more
3320362 i hope we can keep a hold of mark mcghee and give him the transfer funds to enable him to bring in a few more signings
3320363 a good season would see us having a good go at the uefa cup group stages and go on a couple of good domestic cup runs im not asking for much
3320364 david clarkson has been brilliant for us and was superb last season hes given so much to the club for someone so young keith lasley is very much under rated
3320365 with such a gap and a bag of games in hand it really only was ours to throw away and that we did
3320366 give up trying to make the lad run about all day let someone else do it give him the ball and he will put it away
3320367 not many home games stick in the memory from last season and our lack of goals 26 the lowest in the spl by some margin proved perhaps that we were trying to not lose games rather than win them
3320368 however our away form has never really been the problem all too often good performances at tynecastle easter road and parkhead were followed up by lacklustre home defeats to sides we should be beating
3320369 i loved my lexus almost as much as my firstborn
3320370 well a far second anyway it was a dream car but i had an epiphany when gas hit 3 a gallon
3320371 ive cut my gas consumption in half or even better by parking my old reliable gmc suburban in favor of a bmw motorcycle
3320372 in most cases a pair of khakis and a dress shirt can be teamed up with a blazer in the saddle bags for a business look business associates have gotten used to the boots
3320373 flying to istanbul and back from rome was too big a hassle
3320374 the cruise and related expense was just too much for what we would have gotten
3320375 for too long citizens told our political leaders to make sure we have low gas prices even if we have to drill holes in some third world country that hates us we need 4 to 5 a gallon gas to make it painful enough for us to demand a fix

3320377 the effect of the dollar is having a relatively profound effect over the wider metals complex
3320378 sentiments having a big impact whats driving the market at the moment is the fear of weaker economic growth in the united states and the europe
3320379 copper is heading toward 7 000 and we will test that to see if it holds in the near term
3320380 the biggest problem facing commodities now is fund selling and we fear that those funds will move their money into other asset classes such as forex
3320381 adverse chinese data points have been coupled with a selloff in commodity markets and a rising dollar
3320382 this in turn has resulted in the unwinding of speculative positions in the commodity markets and a reversal of the short financials and long mining trade
3320383 we dont see any substantial slowdown in emerging markets weve seen some seasonal weakness in china but the outlook still looks strong
3320384 zinc prices have fallen to levels not seen since late 2005 as the outlook for the metal looks weak due to plentiful supply

3320400 arsenal always want to play in the champions league and i think arsenal need to play in the champions league
3320401 if you have good players and a big stadium then i think you need to play in the highest league in europe
3320402 but this is football if you dont win these two games then you wont qualify and youll play in the uefa cup
3320403 i know them quite well as i have dutch satellite tv at home
3320404 they had a great year last year but they lost two of their best players karim el ahmadi went to feyenoord and orlando engelaar went to schalke they were the playmakers but they got one good player back from vitesse theo janssen so they are still in good shape with a good team
3320405 to be honest it was quite a big shock when they won the play off because in holland everyone expected ajax to win but in the end twente played better than them they had two good games one i think they won 4 2 so yes it was a shock but these things happen in football
3320406 women have for centuries been recognized as talented listeners nurturers motivators excellent communicators these very qualities that we once were told were unbusinesslike are precisely the qualities that business needs most to tap human potential
3320407 we have a tendency to make assumptions about what might happen based on imperfect information and our natural confirmation bias that is we look for data that confirms our beliefs unconsciously dismissing anything that counters them we also tend to fall into the narrative fallacy trap building up a model or theory in our minds based on past events which are static and applying it ad infinitum to a dynamic process we call life we help people access more information through structure conversation and visualization providing greater clarity not only of what the individuals and teams want but also of how they think about what they want we help them think more clearly and design a better future

3320410 regardless of its cause drug addiction is a real problem
3320411 pot made me get so paranoid i thought i was going to kill myself
3320412 well you know it might not be paranoia what it might be is just an increased realization of how fucking crazy and scary life really is usually you put up blinders and you protect yourself from all those thoughts and thats how you live comfortably because otherwise youd think about how vulnerable you are and thats fucking scary and it could have been emotional shit that was going on and you know it also could have been that you smoked too much pot youre not supposed to do too much of it thats a big mistake that people make dont get crazy when you get crazy and you go too deep its too hard to communicate its too hard to talk its like your brain is overwhelmed with information
3320413 perhaps we should be more open to the thoughts that come to us no matter how scary for those same thoughts come to me while sober and are just as scary but happy accepting and lovely thoughts come to me as well its a nice balance that counteracts naivety to my own mortality point being i have to be prepared and open to whatever my mind brings to me or else of course i will freak out and try to numb my mind
3320414 the keys to serial management innovation tackle a big problem as general motors did by inventing the divisional structure to bring order to its sprawling family of companies search for radical management principles as visas founders did when they envisioned self organization and created the first non stock for profit membership enterprise challenge conventional management beliefs which toyota did by deciding that frontline employees not top executives make the best process innovators
3320415 verg enza ante el espect culo denigrante que est n dando los socialistas a cuenta de la financiaci n auton mica un sentimiento que experimentan muchos ciudadanos al ver actuar a los presidentes auton micos socialistas
3320416 algo tan grande en nuestra democracia como hasta ahora era la solidaridad entre regiones y la cohesi n territorial ha sido reducido por los socialistas a una feria denigrante de privilegios y favoritismos
3320417 por mucho que el gobierno intente ahora escenificar otra cosa fue el mismo zapatero quien impuls un estatuto como el catal n que es incompatible con la constituci n y con una financiaci n auton mica equilibrada y justa
3320418 en la trifulca que tiene montada el presidente del gobierno ning n socialista habla de cohesi n justicia solidaridad o equilibro s lo de privilegios favoritismos chantajes y precios pol ticos
3320419 zapatero es el responsable ltimo de esta rifa denigrante al haber roto principios b sicos como la justicia distributiva el equilibrio presupuestario o la cohesi n social con el objetivo de comprar apoyos parlamentarios y favorecer o discriminar arbitrariamente a unas u otras comunidades aut nomas
3320420 several years ago joel slemrod and matt shapiro former colleagues at the university of michigan estimated that only about 22 of the tax rebates provided during the last recession were directed to consumption with the bulk going to savings and debt service given the much higher debt burdens today i dont expect this instance to be much different in the end the u s economy will carry a larger amount of u s treasury debt and a somewhat smaller amount of mortgage and credit card debt than it would have in the absence of the fiscal stimulus
3320421 the evidence is now in and that optimism was unwarranted recent government statistics show that only between 10 and 20 of the rebate dollars were spent the rebates added nearly 80 billion to the permanent national debt but less than 20 billion to consumer spending this experience confirms earlier studies showing that one time tax rebates are not a cost effective way to increase economic activity

3320436 tell them you are sorry tell them that you care
3320437 anche per questo la fiorentina non lascia niente al caso
3320438 tutto la citt toscana la squadra ci penso spesso i compagni della fiorentina erano fantastici
3320439 se hai una machina cos non puoi non farti notare
3320440 no non sono piu in contatto con nessuno tante volte ho pensato di venire a firenze ma il tempo non lo avevo bati era una persona strana
3320441 difficile da spiegare lui era semplicemente originale ci vedevamo davvero poco lui sorvegliava la sua vita privata non andava neanche a fare la spesa si faceva tutto mandare a casa quando giocavo a firenze avevo il suo numero per poi lha cambiato lui era una megastar
3320442 si puo dire s c erano calciatori clamorosi era un passo avanti grande per me e anche per la mia famiglia loro erano felici in toscana la vita l ci piaciuta stato uno shock per tutti quando sono dovuto andare via la squadra per aveva debiti e ha venduto tanti calciatori
3320443 naturalmente la squadra ha unalta qualit mutu e gilardino sono clamorosi lo slavia sar in una situazione difficilissima
3320444 chiaro no per la fiorentina anche se lo slavia giocasse contro manchester juventus oppure chelsea cio le squadre che io non amo non tiferei per lo slavia lo stesso
3320445 che lo slavia ha nella squadra tanti calciatori di alta qualit loro conoscono solo necid di tanti altri giocatori molto bravi non hanno mai sentito non sanno neanche chi allena la squadra in questo aspetto gli italiani sono diversi quelo che c fuori dallitalia non li interessa tanto
3320446 possibile sono fatti cos ma la fiorentina molto ambiziosa ha speso tanti soldi per rinforzare la squadra vuole tornare in champions sono professionisti e questo obiettivo lo raggiungeranno

3320463 i thought it should have been a lot closer after the first round
3320464 i think the score was bad i think they were giving him a score for anything and i had to work to get all of my points i knew going in that the only way i could win this fight is dont let him hit me
3320465 im not saying he won but when youre chasing the bout you do things youre not comfortable with im not grouching here we lost fair and square but you saw it for yourselves
3320466 im very sad i thought i would be the winner i already beat him once before

3320468 i dont know too much its all relative to the politics of it i know that the game is being promoted more around the world major league baseball has done an outstanding job of promoting the game around the world and it would be sad to see it go away
3320469 in past years before it became a medal sport baseball was a demonstration sport so its been there the interest i think has been significant enough to grow it into a medal sport
3320470 but well see what happens im keeping my fingers crossed and trying to be as confident as possible that it will be reinstated for 2016
3320471 baseball is a significant sport that is being recognized around the world now and enough people watch it now
3320472 as they do more more teams and countries will be interested in playing
3320473 id like to think that we were the genesis of what red sox nation is right now to turn boston from an also ran team and organization to one that can perennially look to contending to not only win the pennant but the world series
3320474 theyve proven the last few times theyve been there that theyve been able to win it im happy for that especially for the ownership to continue what tom yawkey started during that time that ownership has done things in a first class way and theyve given that city the team and the caliber of players that they need too to provide a championship
3320475 just a few swings and i can tell how the hitters are going to be
3320476 even with that it comes down to when that guy stands in that batters box hes all by himself
3320477 its up to us as coaches and instructors to give them as much intelligence as we possibly can to see what pitchers like to do in certain situations and their tendencies but again its still incumbent upon that player once he steps in that batters box to hit the pitch and to try to hit it hard somewhere

3320492 thats weird theres nothing like that going around at the moment
3320493 ive never been involved in a game like that before as a pro going wire to wire with no penalties or turnovers
3320494 those are the two things that stand out to me about tonights game and thats what we continue to emphasize around here winning edges
3320495 thats something our line takes a great deal of pride in keeping our defense fresh
3320496 converting on third and 1 is like making a statement tonight was nothing i havent seen from michael bennett before he just works hard and doesnt complain hes consistent and before you know it hes going to give you that big run
3320497 everyone in this room already knows how good michael bennett is
3320498 hes fast hes strong and hes got good vision fundamentally this was a very good game for us no penalties or turnovers thats what you want we didnt do the little things that get you beat in this league
3320499 we got into a good rhythm and when other guys came in they did a great job too
3320500 we had a good running game going tonight were going to watch the film today and there will be a lot to build on i thought we looked pretty good out there
3320501 it feels good to say i played my first game as a pro
3320502 just like i expected the speed of the game in the nfl is a lot faster
3320503 you really wont know until you sit down and watch the tape but id say it was ok
3320504 its only one game but our line has taken an extra step
3320505 we kept converting on short yardage tonight and we did it convincingly where you dont even have to bring out the sticks to measure
3320506 they were all young last year and they kind of got thrown into the fire and did really well now theyre a year older and adding jeff faine at center really helps the offensive line should be one of the strong points of our team all season long

3320616 this fact has seemingly surprised a number of progressive people who are bemoaning obamas shift to the center its sad that some who seek progressive change are missing the forest for the trees
3320617 but they will not dampen the wide and deep enthusiasm for blocking a third bush term represented by john mccain or for bringing obama by a landslide into the white house with a large democratic congressional majority
3320618 the struggle to defeat the ultra right and turn our country on a positive path will not end with obamas election
3320619 but that step will shift the ground for successful struggles going forward
3320620 one thing is clear none of the peoples struggles from peace to universal health care to an economy that puts main street before wall street will advance if mccain wins in november lets keep our eyes on the prize
3320621 it was not an endorsement and i have no further comment
3320622 obamas hope change and unity campaign because they see in it the thrilling opportunity to end 30 years of ultra right rule and move our nation forward with a broadly progressive agenda
3320623 at the core are americas working families of all hues and ethnicities whose determination to move forward does not depend on and will not be diverted by the daily twists and turns of this watershed presidential campaign they are taking the long view
3320624 if obamas candidacy represented nothing more than the spark for this profound initiative to unite the working class and defeat the pernicious influence of racism it would be a transformative candidacy that would advance progressive politics for the long term
3320625 endorse and join in the anti bush anti right wing sentiments that are driving so many people to activism
3320626 the communist party usa views the 2008 elections as a tremendous opportunity to defeat the policies of the right wing republicans and to move our country in a new progressive direction
3320627 we will work with others to defeat the republican nominee and to end right wing control of the new congress

3320631 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3320632 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganised
3320633 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3320634 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3320635 no we did not receive any money back from the obama campaign at any time
3320636 from my perspective i think it is meant to be protective to safeguard security and safety and all the athletes and everybody
3320637 with regards to the stabbing incident i think relevant authorities may have increased the security level
3320638 i do not think there is a real threat you are safe
3320639 it just stands to reason that people are more likely to announce their support of candidates who are mentioned by pollsters
3320640 i dont want to say there has been a conspiracy among the pollsters and major media to exclude any mention of the alternatives but until now it is a fact nonetheless
3320641 what i really want traditional republicans the kind of people who enthusiastically supported ronald reagan to understand is that mccains election will be worse for them and worse for the nation in the long run than a victory by obama
3320642 important documents not only for yemen but for the region

3320645 the west is supporting one palestinian faction over the other its all about politics not human rights
3320646 we have warned of the west bank government turning into a security regime and there are indications that we are heading in that direction

3320648 it works in the west bank too therefore i cannot act as if nothing has happened

3320652 we need to go to the facilities where these devices are constructed you could call them ied factories and we need to go after the people who are putting them together and thats precisely what weve been doing
3320653 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently under way what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province
3320654 yet another example of the good work theyre doing in oruzgan

3320656 these kids were running around with six to eight teeth rotting in their mouth i mean rotting
3320657 jo anns fear is that if she and the other volunteers dont do something theres no other safety net available
3320658 who will help these people if not them if there were a superstructure a well developed network that took care of them maybe these volunteers would not be as energized
3320659 fortunately theres a group of folks trying to help these people in spite of the lack of attention on the international side

3320670 how is that different from us troops invading the sovereign state of iraq
3320671 this is an occupation half of georgia is under russian control our aim now is to build up our troops and to create a defensive line in front of tbilisi

3320675 common knowledge and has been reported in the media that al qaeda is going back into iran and receiving training and are coming back into iraq from iran
3320676 its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
3320677 i was raised with midwestern values and an unshakable faith in america and its policies
3320678 now americans who believe in the second amendment believe its a matter of constitutional right americans who believe in god believe its a matter of personal faith who the hell is hillary clinton to define the values and beliefs of americans and claim they exist for society at large

3320704 there is no imaginable excuse for russias invasion of georgia

3320722 i have just read the immortal poems of the ages and come away dull i dont know whos at fault maybe its the weather but i sense a lot of pretense and poesy footwork i am writing a poem they seem to say look at me poetry must be forgotten we must get down to raw paint splatter i think a man should be forced to write in a roomful of skulls bits of raw meat hanging nibbled by fat slothy rats the sockets musicless staring into the wet ether sogged love sogged hate sogged brain and forevermore the rockets and flares and chains of history winging like bats bat flap and smoke and skulls ringing in the beer yes

3320724 it seems odds on that house prices will continue to head rapidly south
3320725 elevated affordability pressures on potential house buyers stem from high house prices modest disposable income growth and the squeeze on purchasing power coming from soaring utility bills and high food prices while very tight credit conditions have led to markedly fewer and more expensive mortgages being available

3320731 he has been at the d sseldorf main station a lot and has slept in the luggage lockers there but this is no reason to jail him
3320732 i am not even convinced that deutsche bahn can legally ban him from the station it is a public place it is like trying to ban someone from a park lawn
3320733 but this was taken to appeal a process which is continuing at the moment
3320734 we have a very generous social state in germany but it does not and in my view should not cover a persons drug habits
3320735 but i think we should as a society be ready to accept that some people have these problems
3320736 it might be annoying to have someone begging in a train station or sleeping there if they are homeless but i think as a society we should be able to cope with that such a case should not be the business of criminal law

3320738 the russian president confirmed his decision to mr solana to stop military operations in georgia
3320739 mr solana welcomed this decision underlining the importance of peace and stability in the region and said that the european union was ready to actively contribute to a solution to the crisis
3320740 thats why we support the french position and president nicolas sarkozy because it is very balanced between the two sides
3320741 either we dialogue with russia as a bloc or we give up and fail
3320742 the european members of the un security council should have the same point of view on the subject
3320743 it would be crazy if we the british and others had different opinions during a debate within europe or worse within the security council
3320744 georgia should understand that invading would be totally counter productive just like the bombing of the tbilisi airport by the russians
3320745 i think we need to think beyond the square by having an institution that facilitates that sort of cooperation across the policy spaces rather than one specifically constrained to economic mandate
3320746 in developing this discussion lets be clear what an asia pacific community is not
3320747 it is not an economic union it is not a monetary union it is not at this stage even a customs union it is a concept and it is certainly not a political union
3320748 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3320749 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3320750 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3320751 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3320752 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3320753 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3320754 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3320755 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3320756 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3320757 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3320758 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3320759 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

3320789 de vos heeft zijn bijnaam niet gestolen ze zijn bijzonder sluw s nachts is hier altijd wel wat lawaai van katten of andere beesten vossen besluipen hun prooi in alle stilte mijn honden konden dat niet horen
3320790 vossen zijn een beschermde diersoort je mag ze niet afschieten ik vraag me af wie mijn kippen zal beschermen

3320807 bears are big and hairy gay men if youre not hairy youre not a bear
3320808 i started the group partly because i wanted to dispel the notion that fatter guys had low self esteem and didnt like going out and having fun
3320809 actually a lot of us already knew each other so i thought why not organise activities like going to the movies or playing badminton so that we can get together on a regular basis
3320810 we thought that since quite a few of us were in the creative industries why not organise a little art show of our own works and auction them off to our members for charity
3320811 it would make a nice change from the usual movie outings and social get togethers and also be a chance to do something for our community and i guess theres a wackiness to the idea of big heavy guys peddling fine art
3320812 its one of the last events on the indignation calendar and we hope everyone can come down to see the works and support a good cause
3320813 its being held in a club which is not a typical art venue but that gives the show quite a cool underground feel

3320833 the authorities are apt to arrest leaders of the churches they arrest whoever is in charge of the affairs a sister of mine and i went to visit li li at a detention center and tried to give her some luggage they directed us to the homeland security defense brigade office
3320834 the homeland security defense brigade of the municipal public security bureau is in charge of arresting people they asked me direct questions and the investigation was thorough they asked me how many years i have been a christian and where i was baptized upon seeing me she knew immediately that i am an ordinary believer and not a leader therefore she didnt arrest us
3320835 on the other hand li li came to this area to preach the gospel from jilin province
3320836 when his sisters and his wife went to see him wang shuang they saw upon entering the door that he was being hung with handcuffs his trousers were at the bottom and his underwear was up there without the waistband when the sisters came back and told other people they were shocked
3320837 when i went to the public security bureau to ask for the reasons they also detained me for a day there they interrogated me and asked me where i was baptized and where i began to believe in jesus after the interrogation they hauled me back and turned my house upside down they didnt find anything but took away my notebook and my bible they also destroyed my kang the warm bed just to look for gospel flyers and books

3320840 whereas approximately 20 percent of household goods and services are purchased from businesses located outside soweto almost half of sowetans purchases are from new or established retail malls or centres in soweto
3320841 almost 60 percent of sowetans shop at new or established retail malls on saturdays
3320842 also due to many sowetans still working outside soweto shoppers tend to rather engage in top up or fill up shopping than bulk shopping outside soweto

3320856 social networks really dont care if you get pawned or not
3320857 people know if they go on a computer and download a programme they could get a virus they dont have the same view of how dangerous that can be on a social networking site
3320858 once the content is moved from their site they have no control over that
3320859 we think you should make a profile for yourself before somebody else does

3320867 exercise can help older people to stay mobile and independent ensure a healthy heart keep weight and stress levels under control and promote better sleep

3320882 social networking in asia is growing at an amazing rate and friendster is in front at the moment with a very clear leadership in this space
3320883 asia not just one region its a sequence of very interesting and diverse cultures and economies if you intend to be successful in multiple asian countries it shows that you have the ability to adapt and offer a flexible service
3320884 we have twitter like functionality on our mobile web service and that has been very actively adopted in asia twitter type functions work really well on mobile phones so at friendster we think thats the area to focus on because people want to send short comments quickly while theyre on the road

3320950 he is a very fast player he has a lot to learn and has only been here in belfast for just over a week but so far we have been very impressed with him both as a person and a player it will be a steep learning curve for him here but we are very pleased with him so far

3320991 the so called breakthrough over the department of justice amounts to very little an agreement on a single department with a single minister neither the dup nor sinn fein are prepared to take the job
3320992 apparently all the dup and sinn fein have proposed is a minister who would not even be a member of the executive how could anyone fulfil a role as important as justice minister in those circumstances
3320993 remember that minister would not even have a vote on the budget they would not be able to argue within the executive for new legislation an issue as important as justice cannot be treated in this way
3320994 this proposal is as ludicrous as the half baked carve up they came up with on the victims commission it is unworkable and deeply flawed
3320995 with the dup and sinn fein its either cosy carve up or complete meltdown
3320996 the executives structures are simply not working at present and there are few signs that the dup and sinn fein are capable of making the necessary changes
3320997 the justice ministry proposal is another example of a badly thought through carve up
3320998 the executive has not met since mid june and will not meet again until mid september
3320999 responsibility for dealing with all the outstanding problems lies with ministers with those who told us last may that they could form a government for all the people of northern ireland

3321002 there is no doubt that that group of people are enemies of islam and global peace and therefore efforts should be made to fight their ugly crusade as both islam and christianity believe in respecting all prophets

3321028 i was driving home in the middle of the night after having been to my fathers house in the mountains i began to imagine the story of someone probably a travelling salesman who had to travel a great deal periodically when he felt overwhelmed by the circumstances of his life he would park his car by the side of the road leave the headlights on walk a few paces in front of the car and then lie down as if he was the victim of an accident or a heart attack or a crime
3321029 he could have this enormous cathartic emotional outburst in their arms people would console him and tell him that everything was going to be all right that is what the story choke started as me in the dirt

3321051 the perseid meteors are the debris of a comet that is now far away from the sun where it spends most of its life in the coldness of space however during the perseid shower the earth passes through the trail of dust debris that the comet left behind many years ago
3321052 when one of these dust particles is intercepted by our planet as it orbits the sun it causes the dust particle to completely burn up leaving an eye catching streak of light
3321053 perseid meteors appear to originate from the direction of the constellation perseus which rises in the northeast the best view is in this direction and far away from city lights onlookers should find a safe dark site such as a city or state park where oncoming vehicle headlights wont interfere

3321083 maar liefst 33 van de nieuw verkochte autos komt op naam van een vrouwelijke eigenaar op de tweedehandse markt is dit aandeel nog groter voor deze grote groep zelfbewuste dames is de autominnende vrouw weet de showroom prima te vinden en weet wat ze wil en wat ze mooi vindt het is een felbegeerd fashion item dat haar persoonlijkheid extra onderstreept
3321084 we have not put one together for over a year
3321085 current fuel prices and the economy are actually attracting new travelers that never seriously considered a cruise vacation because of the overall value and total costs of alternative vacations
3321086 i think the standard here is much lower than spain because in spain basketball from division one right through to division four is completely professional
3321087 they have professional practice in the morning and in the evening the coach and everyone thinks basketball 24 hours a day here the coach thinks basketball too but the players only practice a few times a week the big difference is that in spain there is more money to help basketball
3321088 we have learned about the infrastructure of basketball in spain through mariano we are trying to learn how they organise and manage their clubs and see how we can improve
3321089 its really good and also reinforcing to see that we are teaching the right things but you get more new ideas from these master classes about how to teach it in different and maybe better ways
3321090 also maybe we could send players across to camps to work with high standard players so that we can develop further and improve basketball at the university

3321107 we feel the valet program will help us set sound market entry strategies and significantly accelerate our export efforts
3321108 establishing an overseas business will require a wide range of resources as we develop new products seek new distribution partners and learn to sell and market small appliances to a new and different consumer
3321109 we look forward to obtaining more in depth intelligence to make sound decisions on product proposals and identify suitable distribution partners
3321110 building on the success that we achieved by participating in the vedps aim program and trade missions participating in the valet program represents a natural progression in our strategy to expand our exports to latin america
3321111 we trust that with the valet programs financial support expert guidance and network of accomplished international business professionals pari will be able to increase and expedite our demand generation capability and thus our export sales to latin america
3321112 it was not as much as we would have liked but as it was the first year i think this is a great building block for the future we need to do a bit more advertising in and out of the transit system as ridership is quite high next year it would be more beneficial to promote the week is coming up within the transit system
3321113 i spent a lot of money on that land not knowing what would happen i took chances not knowing whether it would get out of the agriculture land reserve
3321114 i have invested in prince george heavily over the past twenty odd years because i think that prince george is moving from a forest based economy to one that will involve the movement of goods and services out of the prince george airport and from the new terminal at prince rupert to around the world
3321115 i believe that wac bennett took this part of the province out of the ice age we have waited a long time for another movement of the economy and i think it will now happen forestry will not recover in the manner it was previously and we need to get on with the development of a value added industry not just producing raw materials and shipping them to overseas markets
3321116 now that we have been able to get the land removed from the agriculture land reserve we will be working to try and get industry to move onto the land the land is far less expensive than it is in vancouver or other canadian cities and we need to get that word out
3321117 the road runs through our property and we will need help in developing that highway
3321118 comparatia ntre societatile moderne si cele religioase aduce o clarificare sacrificiul dispare n masura n care un sistem juridic se instaleaza sacrificiul are deci ca functie de a termina razbunarea victima sacrificiala va fi de fapt straina ciclului razbunarii sistemul judiciar nu este de fapt surpimarea razbunarii ci constituie ultimul ei cuv nt sacrificiul nu tine loc de justitie nsa acolo unde institutia e absenta
3321119 pentru a face sa nceteze razbunarea n consecinta ca si pentru a face sa nceteze razboiul n zilele noastre nu este suficient sa i convingem pe oameni ca violenta este odioasa tocmai pentru ca sunt convinsi de aceasta ei si fac o datorie din a o razbuna sistemul judiciar este cel care ndeparteaza amenintarea razbunarii el nu suprima razbunarea o limiteaza n mod efectiv la un act de represalii unic a carui act de executare este ncredintata unei autoritati suverane si specializate n domeniul sau deciziile autoritatii judiciare se afirma ntotdeauna ca ultimul cuv nt al razbunarii

3321121 we are expecting a response from dot prior to the scheduled public hearing
3321122 our concern is that this is in strong contrast to what was recommended to us
3321123 its important that responsible development be applied you can get the golden egg and kill the goose that laid it in the process we want to make sure that beautiful northwest guilford county is preserved
3321124 traffic is already a big issue on 68 edgefield and pleasant ridge roads plus were worried about northwest schools already being overcrowded and clear cutting of trees to build
3321125 our hope is to have the area treated like oak ridge rather than treated like high point
3321126 why do they need to develop more in our area when there is already plenty of space available elsewhere all within minutes of the airport
3321127 what we felt were compromise conditions they really didnt meet any of them except what they would have had to meet anyway we are extremely disappointed with their lack of earnest compromise
3321128 what happens here will set the bar on what happens in this area in the next few years
3321129 although i am very pleased to hear him listening to those around him i saw several quotes from school board members and parents who praised him for saying i dont know and not having a ready made plan
3321130 personally im all for a ready made plan that includes giving back more power to teachers and principals incorporating the community in the schools finding ulterior means for educating students more interested in disrupting schools than planning for their future preventing and not merely handling violence in schools and bringing back skill classes like shop keyboarding and home ec for students not on a traditional college track
3321131 while it was nice to hear that mr green didnt think he had all the answers i would have been more confident if he had a firm vision of direction for guilford county schools
3321132 hopefully this will come after his 100 days of listening mr green will have to stand up and be a leader and hold people accountable
3321133 i think his lack of specifics and plans may be his greatest strength
3321134 mr greens biggest challenge will be to overcome the morale and intimidation issues and the lack of trust that the grier years have heaped upon our teachers

3321171 our review has clearly revealed the weaknesses associated with the integrated one firm business model

3321184 relatively weak evidence base informing medical care in children compared with adults
3321185 all moors can cope with some harriers but few gamekeepers allow any of these predators to breed because of the fear that numbers will subsequently flourish a ceiling scheme is a way of encouraging grouse managers to put an end to illegal killing of harriers safe in the knowledge that numbers will not reach densities where they can threaten the viability of their grouse moors
3321186 if successful this could prove to be a way to both minimise the local impact of predation on grouse moors and increase the national population of harriers providing a win win situation for harrier conservation and grouse management
3321187 hunters have been slow to recognise that illegal killing of raptors is unacceptable in 21st century society where there is strong support for conservation conservationists on the other hand have been unwilling to compromise over any form of intervention to limit harrier densities citing european legislation which prevents such action
3321188 we feel that a fundamental change in attitude is required from all parties to resolve the conflict between harriers and grouse if those involved genuinely wish to strive for a solution then compromises will be required and attitudes to predators their control and their protection will have to be modified to accommodate changed circumstances
3321189 our earlier work showed that feeding harriers can greatly reduce predation rates on grouse chicks however we still do not know how feeding will affect harrier numbers in the long term and indeed whether fed harriers and grouse shooting can coexist
3321190 some of these issues will be addressed by ongoing work at langholm however we suggest that the quickest way of finding an effective solution to this problem is to simultaneously make progress on different fronts it is sensible to test a harrier ceiling now and not wait for ten years until the langholm moor demonstration project is complete

3321195 provincial governments in china send their brightest officials to singapore to learn the secrets of its success for russian politicians it too provides a useful model these countries and others in asia and the middle east are proving that the free market does not require a free society in which to thrive and that in any battle between politics and economics it is the latter that will win out

3321249 i wouldve been hard pressed to come up with an example where electronic wedding invitations would be acceptable except when real life intervenes
3321250 in the past i never would have thought to use an electronic invitation because i dont know if it was as much of a formality as it was about brand awareness and being so protective over how the brand was portrayed
3321251 people always wanted to speak to the hostess when they made a reservation at a restaurant now they just use opentable
3321252 there was a whole segment of event types that people just did not want to use electronic invitations for
3321253 id like to believe that because of how we do things you also get the aesthetic aspect of it you dont have to sacrifice it
3321254 not having to use paper is huge when youre trying to be eco conscious
3321255 its better for the environment its cheaper if not free and youre collecting the majority of your rsvps in a place where theres no human error people either hit yes no or maybe and itll download into a list
3321256 there are always ways to do paper invitations in a cost effective way
3321257 you can get paper print them yourself hand write them
3321258 that point is actually quite well taken because it does create quite a lot of paper waste what might be interesting is to see if there are people or companies that come up with very low impact ways of generating invitations that are either easily recyclable or directly reusable
3321259 if you really know your guests and you really know its a preference for them i think thats great
3321260 at new york fashion week youve got 12 days of shows and events and its highly highly competitive

3321275 the way our statute is currently we probably could tax them but we should probably have the legislature have the final say

3321277 i like brno and ive won there in 125 and in 250 whilst ive not managed a podium in motogp i have always gone well in testing
3321278 this year theyve re laid the track so that will be a new factor for everybody well see
3321279 i hope we can continue to work as well as we did in germany and america but this time finish it off with a result in the race
3321280 the track is definitely suited to our bike so expectations are high
3321281 i personally think he we will do well on the ulster
3321282 i would like to see him get a strong finish a good top five he has not driven the car before but i hope he has no dramas and a stress free run
3321283 there is a lot of pressure on him at the minute obviously i have been talking to one or two people for a while but mark higgins helped sort this they are good friends and he helped phillip put together this deal
3321284 i dont know yet if the deal is just for the ulster
3321285 we only found out about half an hour ago that phillip was definitely going to do the event id like to think it is not a one off but we will have to wait and see
3321286 there is still a lot to be decided and at the moment the car is plain white it has all happened so quickly
3321287 it has come true now and im going to the major leagues its ridiculous im at a loss for words i really dont know what to say about it ill be smiling forever now this is just awesome awesome
3321288 if its going well it should be just the same i imagine
3321289 ill get up there and see i know the atmosphere will be completely different but im sure ill get used to it its going to be fun its going to be a blast with all the adrenaline ill be fine

3321293 in fact three cases filed against senator lacson were already closed and terminated after the ombudsman investigators who conducted the fact finding probe did not find sufficient evidence to pursue the said cases
3321294 the department of education gives its full support for the approval of the house bill 4734 and senate bill 2408 because we have always been cognizant of the need to improve the lot of our teachers
3321295 the total increase will make teachers pay at par with those received by soldiers and policemen
3321296 her independence of thought and self evident sense of mission immediately made her a favorite
3321297 shes whats happening knowledgeable and too cute to be staying indoors blogging
3321298 who do men say that i the son of man am
3321299 some say john the baptist some elijah and others jeremiah or one of the prophets
3321300 you are the christ the son of the living god
3321301 blessed are you simon bar jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father who is in heaven
3321302 i am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about him im ready to accept jesus as a great moral teacher but i dont accept his claim to be god that is the one thing we must not say a man who was merely a man and said the sort of things jesus said would not be a great moral teacher he would either be a lunatic on a level with the man who says he is a poached egg or else he would be the devil of hell you must make your choice either this man was and is the son of god or else a madman or something worse you can shut him up for a fool you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him lord and god but let us not come with any patronising nonsense about his being a great human teacher he has not left that open to us he did not intend to
3321303 jesus is an historical figure for me and hes also a bridge between god and man in the christian faith and one that i think is powerful precisely because he serves as that means of us reaching something higher and hes also a wonderful teacher i think its important for all of us of whatever faith to have teachers in the flesh and also teachers in history
3321304 this could have been a horrible repeat of the fire in little holme walk
3321305 this would be treated as arson with intent to endanger life anyone convicted will be going down for a long time i implore the public to make sure they store bins well away from properties and put them out only when the bin men are coming
3321306 he habitually embarrasses me at social gatherings often while under the influence of alcohol
3321307 tenielle wished to live a lavish and extravagant life style which resulted in us in curring debt and over extending ourselves financially to such an extent that we were regularly approached by the banking institutions regarding my overdrawn accounts
3321308 this is going to be a very interesting case it borders on constitutionality but i dont want to start firing before ive gone to battle
3321309 any action that the city will take will be dependent on our own independent forensic exercise which is as yet inconclusive or a court finding on the matter
3321310 as i turned the machine off i vowed to jane that no matter how long it takes her death will come to mean something to every south african even if it takes years
3321311 i am not just barking i am going to bite very hard and hang on for all the years it takes for justice to be served
3321312 the case had already been postponed four times because of further investigations i am trying to get on with my life but every time i go to court i absolutely break down it is so traumatic and then turns out to be a complete waste of time even going something has to be done to change this system and i am going to do it
3321313 better understanding of the political economical and social aspects of the region
3321314 one must be fully independent of all regional countries and have guts to speak on issues for the region as a whole rather than individualizing for just one country i am suitably qualified to take on that role and my credentials support this
3321315 i was privately approached by a good number of regional countries for this position but regardless of who gets the position the new secretary general should not allow himself to be overwhelmed by the two major countries
3321316 as a secretary general one has to be impartial and be able to be at par as well when dialoguing

3321415 if you look at most of these r rated movies that found an audience its because they were really good
3321416 the r rating allows the filmmakers to truly realize their vision theres just a freedom that comes with it theres no way wedding crashers could have been wedding crashers if you inhibit what it was that owen wilson and vince vaughn were able to do in that movie
3321417 we were like gosh everyones getting to have their cake and eat it too with 40 year old virgin and wedding crashers
3321418 just this little opening seemed to happen with the way the studios were willing to go ok r rated movies seem to be profitable so well maybe open that door a little bit

3321420 there was no talk of toning it down there was no intention of making a conventional movie in an attempt to reach a mass audience

3321461 i want to express the appreciation of the american people for your service and sacrifice in iraq someday the people of iraq will know freedom and democracy and if they do it will be because of your service and sacrifice again on behalf of president bush the united states congress and the american people we thank you you are americas best friends
3321462 someday the people of abkhazia and south ossetia will also know what it is like to live in a free nation
3321463 usman khosa is a pakistani national in his early twenties a graduate of connecticut college now working for the international monetary fund
3321464 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation
3321465 both in territory snatching outside and bureaucratic tyranny inside its chauvinism was beyond all bounds
3321466 the reason lado did this is because he knew the enormous pr value that georgia would gain by going to the money people and analysts particularly since georgia is clearly the aggressor this time
3321467 lado is a former banker himself so he knew that by framing the conflict for the most influential bankers and analysts in new york that these power bankers would then write up reports and go on cnbc and argue lado gurgenidzes talking points it was brilliant and now youre starting to see the american media shift its coverage from calling it georgia invading ossetian territory to the new spin that its russian imperial aggression against tiny little georgia
3321468 when violence broke out in the caucasus on friday morning john mccain quickly issued a statement that was far more strident toward the russians than that of president bush barack obama and much of the west but as russian warplanes pounded georgian targets far beyond south ossetia this weekend bush obama and others have moved closer to mccains initial position
3321469 obama accused russia of escalating the crisis through its clear and continued violation of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
3321470 that russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
3321471 clearly there have been incidents on both sides but this is obviously a planned georgian operation a contingency plan they have had for some time to retake south ossetias capital tskhinvali
3321472 possibly the georgians calculated that with putin in beijing they could recapture the capital in two days and then defend it over the next two months because the russians wont take this lying down
3321473 russia should not be blamed for the fighting but russia should now be pressured not to go beyond its peacekeeping mandate and to ensure that armed militia do not cross the border into south ossetia
3321474 this pushed georgia into a philosophy of self reliance the idea that georgia will be able to regain breakaway entities only by its own means
3321475 the elephant in the room behind this whole story is georgias nato prospects
3321476 it might be a signal to the russians saying that the sochi olympics will not go the way russia wants if there is no progress on the settlement in abkhazia
3321477 and taken to tbilisis notorious isolator number 7 the scene of well documented torture of political prisoners since 1991

3321480 oh sorry we destroyed your city and killed all those people in such a gruesome way when we really didnt have to hey could you pass me that stapler
3321481 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
3321482 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
3321483 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
3321484 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis
3321485 a self righteous one way legal moral screen with positive images of western values and innocence portrayed as threatened validating a campaign of unrestricted violence

3321492 i told natasha that after the first hit my legs were shaking when i got to first base
3321493 at first it seemed kind of daunting coming out here and playing with people like crystal bustos and jennie finch
3321494 but ever since ive joined the team oh my god theyve made it so easy to just be with them and hang out with them
3321495 weve got 10 people back from 2004 who understand what the olympics are about they have a strong passion for the game and what it takes to win
3321496 it was our job to then go out and find five more people who could come in and show that same drive who had those same aspirations
3321497 these young players have bought right into that and theyve done a great job doing what theyre supposed to do

3321500 were trading in west hollywood for west texas and big disposable incomes for disposable diapers
3321501 most important were integrating without abandoning our community or sense of identity these developments are good for lgbt people and good for america
3321502 yes i am a labour luvvy nobody would regard me as anything other than a labour party member lifelong
3321503 on the other hand i have done zillions of jobs in the public sector i have hung my political hat at the door and got on with the job
3321504 if you were to ask any current labour politician whether i was capable of biting their arm off if need be you would only get one answer my track record of being independent is there for all to see and that is irrespective of government labour conservative whatever i get the job done well and i dont trim my sails
3321505 once in a blue moon you have to take tough action because people are not taking you seriously or because they have been given a chance and have not risen to the challenge
3321506 if they do muck around we will come down on them like a ton of bricks
3321507 we have to be at least as tough as the healthcare commission we dont want to be a care failures commission that spots the laggards and biffs them we want to be about improving standards as well as maintaining minimum standards
3321508 the process of bringing together three commissions inevitably means some folk will not get jobs
3321509 among senior teams we dont anticipate people leaving because of financial constraints but if you are the head of a particular division you might not want to hang around and be second in line in a merged inspectorate
3321510 panic not we are going to be big and ambitious there will be lots to do we are going to be the best regulator in the world of health and social care
3321511 john kerry needs one thing to lose a re election in massachusetts a well funded credible opponent he doesnt have that this year
3321512 i have made a decision to end the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace the goals of the operation have been achieved
3321513 the safety of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been established the aggressor has been punished and has suffered significant losses its armed forces are disorganized
3321514 if there are little pockets of opposition and other aggressive manifestations we will make a decision to liquidate them
3321515 i wouldve been hard pressed to come up with an example where electronic wedding invitations would be acceptable except when real life intervenes
3321516 in the past i never would have thought to use an electronic invitation because i dont know if it was as much of a formality as it was about brand awareness and being so protective over how the brand was portrayed
3321517 people always wanted to speak to the hostess when they made a reservation at a restaurant now they just use opentable
3321518 there was a whole segment of event types that people just did not want to use electronic invitations for
3321519 id like to believe that because of how we do things you also get the aesthetic aspect of it you dont have to sacrifice it
3321520 not having to use paper is huge when youre trying to be eco conscious
3321521 its better for the environment its cheaper if not free and youre collecting the majority of your rsvps in a place where theres no human error people either hit yes no or maybe and itll download into a list
3321522 there are always ways to do paper invitations in a cost effective way
3321523 you can get paper print them yourself hand write them
3321524 that point is actually quite well taken because it does create quite a lot of paper waste what might be interesting is to see if there are people or companies that come up with very low impact ways of generating invitations that are either easily recyclable or directly reusable
3321525 if you really know your guests and you really know its a preference for them i think thats great
3321526 at new york fashion week youve got 12 days of shows and events and its highly highly competitive
3321527 if you dont send out a paper invitation it doesnt work theres something about it landing on someones desk and having it be tactile
3321528 a large not quite a quarter yet but about 20 percent of our events are actually wedding related
3321529 but whats going on now points to a bigger truth instability in the marketplace is probably the one thing that were absolutely going to have to get used to
3321530 it is the dream of every investor to some day take the reigns at his or her favorite publicly traded company over the past few years i have invested a significant amount of both my own personal capital and spare time in emoto and have always been a firm believer in the companys future potential in addition i am very pleased to say that my skill set has matched up perfectly with what the company aspired to attain with the hiring of its next coo
3321531 this is a very exciting time for electric moto as our initial blade xt demo bikes begin shipping to both the north american and european markets while development efforts for future products ramp up significantly by taking over the day to day activities of coo our newly appointed ctc ely schless can now place sole focus on his world renowned capabilities surrounding the development of innovative electric vehicle technology with a larger and more focused executive team now at the helm i believe that electric moto corporation is now far better positioned for expansion than it was just a few months ago in closing i am ecstatic to accept the position of coo and look forward to updating the public on our progress as developments unfold over the coming weeks
3321532 we are now waiting for him to wake up and speak so we can find out more details about what happened
3321533 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3321534 one is the sophisticated coordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3321535 if you look at the streets everything seems calm and peaceful
3321536 but behind it all the situation is different people are really angry

3321538 we are pleased to see continued international demand for clean diesels technologies and solutions as compliance requirements become increasingly stringent worldwide and low emission zones lezs are enacted in major cities
3321539 our strategic license agreement with hilite international a leading supplier of automotive powertrain components represents an important new distribution partner with deep penetration into the heavy medium and light duty commercial vehicle and passenger car markets the license enables hilite to utilize our aris r airless injection technology and the patented combination of selective catalytic reduction scr with exhaust gas recirculation egr to reduce oxides of nitrogen nox emissions and to optimize fuel economy this agreement comes on the heels of our agreements with bosch and tenneco and provides further validation of our global licensing strategy and intellectual property strength
3321540 we have experienced strong product sales and revenue growth directly related to londons lez legislation
3321541 with over 63 million diesel engines on the road today and over 11 million new engines going into service annually diesel will continue to play an important role in on road as well as off road markets moreover we believe that clean diesel will support and enhance that growth through our fuel efficient emission reduction technology
3321542 we are pleased to report record second quarter results a strong testament to the resiliency of our global business model and the strength of our offerings in a challenging economic environment during the quarter we advanced each of our key growth initiatives including expansion of our direct to consumer channel international wholesale businesses and the fossil brand we also continued our focus on margin improvement with gross profit margin rising 270 basis points excluding currency benefits although the state of the economy worldwide remains uncertain we will continue to focus on profitable market share growth applying the same disciplines that led to our strong first half performance we believe that managing our costs and inventory based upon sales trends while continuing to invest in our long term growth objectives has us well positioned to achieve our annual goals
3321543 our second quarter financial results are indicative of the shift in capital spending priorities in the first half of 2008 with the majority of our commercial customers focused on adding capacity to existing sites we have made detailed preparations so that we can respond rapidly when our customers spending priorities shift back to performance enhancement projects a transition that we believe has already begun we have also been actively engaged with our customers as they develop plans to deploy the new 700 megahertz spectrum they acquired in march sti is the recognized expert in interference elimination and we are excited to be working on solutions with our customers that will deliver the optimal utilization of this valuable spectrum internationally we are presently completing the final preparatory efforts for the td scdma field trial in china which will be completed shortly after the olympics end later this month
3321544 we also continue to pursue opportunities to utilize our exceptional expertise and patented technologies in several new areas most notably our recently announced collaborative effort with the department of energys los alamos national laboratory this collaboration involves the research and development of high temperature superconducting hts power distribution applications that save energy and provide higher capacity power lines for the electrical grid

3321569 as exsa member activities are key drivers for a healthy economy and more specifically for the communications industry the media has made a huge difference in positioning our collective efforts in this regard i do not only want to single out exhibitions and events related media but also the business to business as well as the consumer trade and technical titles
3321570 media coverage about the exhibitions and events industry is in our national interest as it attracts thousands of business persons from outside south africa just look at events such as the world economic forum which was held at the cape town international convention centre or the soccerex exhibition which took place at the sandton convention centre other examples that attract international visitors are the nedbank golf challenge at sun city and specialist congresses and conferences such as in the specialist medical field the more regular professional members of the industry interact with the media and submit accurate information for them to inform the public at large the more our industry will benefit from the exposure as the news about these events travels the globe through online media potential tourists gain confidence to visit our shores and experience an industry which can compete with the best in the world with being at leisure in south africa as a bonus attraction

3321581 ive never played singles at the olympics so this has been really cool for me
3321582 every time i walk out there its like im playing in my match but at the same time i have the whole u s team on my side its good i really like that feeling
3321583 obviously its a long ways away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the u s
3321584 its hard to train for singles and always dealing with swelling ive just really been playing careful with it i really wanted to be here in whatever capacity it was and it became painfully obvious to me that role was doubles i was very happy to accept that and move forward
3321585 but with the time difference im still waking up like at 5 in the morning so its good i like the early matches
3321586 my way of improving on it is to keep it up

3321588 when a clients current working guide dog is approaching retirement age each owner is given the opportunity to apply for a replacement guide dog
3321589 they are then reassessed for their continued suitability to be a guide dog owner
3321590 factors such as walking pace balance and ability to care for the dog are all taken into account to ensure a guide dog is still a suitable and safe means of mobility aid for a client
3321591 in the case of eric gamsby the charity was unable to accept eric for a replacement guide dog straight away due to concerns regarding his capability and potential safety to be a guide dog owner
3321592 however there were several temporary factors to be taken into account which meant the charity took the decision to reassess eric again at a later date

3321626 aunque las bajas pueden ser por diferentes motivos contrasta que el pasado a o y con estos mismos motivos hubo 9 400 bajas menos
3321627 un motivo a adido para que el n mero de bajas de dispare de esta manera ya que el peso de la agricultura en la comunitat es importante

3321633 la actividad comercial en la comunitat valenciana goza de una salud envidiable y s lo hay que recorrer las calles y plazas de nuestros pueblos y ciudades para apreciar la existencia de un comercio urbano fuerte y vital que coexiste con otras f rmulas comerciales conformando una estructura comercial plenamente adaptada a las necesidades de los consumidores actuales y futuros
3321634 no obstante la actividad comercial se halla en constante cambio y evoluci n y su principal reto consiste en adaptarse y anticiparse a los cambios que se producen en los h bitos de compra de los consumidores

3321637 sabemos que los tr mites legales llevan su tiempo pero para el que sufre cada d a y cada hora es amargo saber que esta persona que no merece este calificativo porque es un cobarde que agrede a una mujer y a un hombre por la espalda y le sigue agrediendo con gran violencia cuando est en el suelo siguiera en la calle
3321638 la m xima pena prevista para este tipo de delitos
3321639 que todos tenemos la sensaci n de que tienen pocas penas y fr giles para lo terrible de los hechos cometidos
3321640 que no prime el individualismo el ego smo y el pasotismo sino el intentar extirpar esta agresividad y violencia
3321641 estoy muy orgullosa de mi marido y siento una enorme satisfacci n porque es un ejemplo para mis hijos y para cualquier mujer que haya sido agredida que le hubiera encantado tener a una persona que pasara a su lado y tratar de evitarlo aunque no puedo estar m s triste por las consecuencias de su intervenci n

3321649 its getting increasingly evident that this is a once in a century type of phenomenon
3321650 not the standard type of liquidity crisis that we have seen in the past
3321651 its still very evident from inter bank lending spreads that we have not gotten closure yet
3321652 its essentially fundamentally the price of homes in the united states which are determining the ultimate collateral of mortgage backed bonds pretty much around the world
3321653 were still nowhere near the bottom of the home price thing
3321654 ultra expansionary u s monetary policies with artificially low interest rates led to bubbles all over the world and in every imaginable asset class the price of gold more than doubled in nominal terms and against the dow jones industrial average
3321655 central banks of necessity determine what the money supply is
3321656 if you are on a gold standard or other mechanism in which the central banks do not have discretion then the system works automatically
3321657 the reason there is now very little support for the gold standard is the consequences of those types of market adjustments are not considered to be appropriate in the 20th and 21st century i am one of the rare people who have still some nostalgic view about the old gold standard as you know but i must tell you i am in a very small minority among my colleagues on that issue

3321660 me acuerdo de mi debut en la bundesliga 19 de agosto 1994 con el stuttgart en el minuto 90 de aquel partido contra el hamburgo marqu el gol de la victoria el momento m s amargo seguramente fue la derrota que sufrimos contra el chelsea en la final de la recopa de europa de 1998 no obstante visto en perspectiva haber participado en aquella final ha sido uno de los mayores xitos de mi carrera
3321661 todos los equipos en los que he jugado ocupan un lugar especial en mi coraz n
3321662 j rgen klinsmann me llam y mantuvimos una conversaci n muy correcta marcada sobre todo por el respeto mutuo durante esa charla me di cuenta de lo consecuente que era con sus ideas y su firme decisi n de ponerlas en pr ctica los cambios que hab a pensado introducir en el equipo resultaron totalmente acertados
3321663 el equipo sigue progresando y estar sin duda alguna entre los favoritos al t tulo en sud frica contamos con excelentes jugadores j venes y excelentes veteranos suficiente para conquistar el t tulo todav a es demasiado pronto para ese tipo de pron sticos en el f tbol dos a os son una eternidad
3321664 es muy interesante seguir el f tbol desde el punto de vista de los medios de comunicaci n es una perspectiva de la que careces mientras est s en activo las retransmisiones en directo son impresionantes en esta labor tambi n es muy importante el trabajo en equipo igual que sobre el terreno de juego los grandes astros no ganan los partidos ellos solos ni sobre el terreno de juego ni en las cabinas de los comentaristas
3321665 siempre estoy de viaje igual que cuando jugaba pero mis tres chicas no me conocen de otra manera por eso al igual que hac a cuando estaba en activo trato de disfrutar con mi familia de cada minuto libre sin la familia todo me resultar a imposible
3321666 no me veo en ese puesto aunque como me he tratado con tantos entrenadores he acumulado bastante experiencia pero fredi bobic en el banquillo eso no lo ver nadie mi objetivo a medio plazo es trabajar en la direcci n deportiva en alg n club
3321667 he sido futbolista profesional todo lo dem s me ha llegado por a adidura y de regalo

3321790 there is not a cell in my body that can accept the idea that mr obama can keep us safe from the terrorists around the world and from iran which is making great strides toward getting the atomic bomb

3321886 i thought he pitched well enough saturday to be a consideration for the bullpen as well he would also be a guy that we would consider if we feel guys need an extra day to be a sixth starter
3321887 justin christian has had a lot of success off left handed pitchers and played well
3321888 its only a matter of time until they dig deep and get some good at bats
3321889 we need to start swinging the bats and we need to start doing it tonight
3321890 we cant continue to perform this way later in a game
3321891 i wasnt hitting my spots the way i wanted to and i fell behind hitters so i made it tougher on myself than it had to be
3321892 these games are going to come back and were going to end up killing ourselves
3321893 we have an entire bullpen struggling at the same time and you dont have a closer its tough
3321894 when i was in minnesota we played brett and the packers twice a year and i remember watching our defensive preparation all week long and then you get to the game and he just tears you apart
3321895 you try to disguise as many looks as you can and he recognizes it and throws a quick pass outside
3321896 having a guy like that on your team knows it keeps the defense honest
3321897 im not sure exactly what defenses are going to play
3321898 they know the caliber of play know what favre brings to the table and they may back up or they may not
3321899 obviously as a running back you want to go up there with six guys in the box thats one less guy that you have to deal with before you get in the secondary im going to do everything i can to make his life easier try get him acclimated to offense and team
3321900 just the fact that you have a proven quarterback whos had an outstanding career is enough for people to pay attention
3321901 very awkward i have never been on the outside like that in practice
3321902 if i had to i definitely could if i went id be pushing it by playing it safe thats the best thing to do i think they got a lot of other guys they want to evaluate hopefully im not one of them
3321903 i mean people need to stop crying about that man to be honest with you
3321904 im getting sick of that like who cares brett favre is there whether or not were getting pushed to the back i still have a family to feed brett favre has absolutely nothing to do with me he has absolutely nothing to do with the new york giants
3321905 i have no hesitation in recommending this book to practitioners of all grades
3321906 a valuable companion should not be missing in any medical library
3321907 i made the suggestion that it be friday in front of us
3321908 i am not necessarily sure lets see how long it takes
3321909 if everything goes well i think in a couple days
3321910 i feel like ive been making good progress every day taking a good step forward each time
3321911 according to nfl rules we do have to carry that game jags titans even though we are aware of the potential interest in the other game jets dolphins
3321912 beijing olympics while georgia burned george w bush played volleyball
3321913 im ticked off that a sentinel sports columnist cant find enough sports news to write about that he has to resort to quoting jokes from the leno and letterman tv shows that berate the president of our country and are neither funny or entertaining the writers strike was a blessing to all of us my lame duck vote goes to him not bush

3321917 the idea of a common foreign policy and the means to implement it in the lisbon treaty are anathema to eurosceptics but a disunited eu will be easy meat for russia and leave america without a partner of weight to face down russian bullying
3321918 this is no pipeline war but an assault on russian influence
3321919 the value of nato is not only in providing for our collective security
3321920 we shouldnt admit georgia thank god we didnt too late now
3321921 the pseudo left sic is fond of a wildly decontextualised quotation from george galloway
3321922 if you are asking did i support the soviet union yes i did yes i did support the soviet union and i think the disappearance of the soviet union is the biggest catastrophe of my life if there was a soviet union today we would not be having this conversation about plunging into a new war in the middle east and the us would not be rampaging around the globe
3321923 were just giving a heads up to the community that we still need to be vigilant
3321924 its even more urgent given the recent rainfall to be careful in our backyards the areas in our control to try and decrease the breeding grounds

3321929 clubs using clubscan have reported a 70 per cent drop in disorder theres no other initiative thats had such a dramatic impact on venues
3321930 when i film i try to be invisible i like to think im attempting to achieve a sort of objectivity
3321931 i worked with actors once but im not really that interested in narrative cinema life on the street is so interesting that i cant imagine why people would want to invent stories
3321932 it was a very violent time with terrible racism and a sense that the community was divided
3321933 it was very important to capture everything naturally so i adopted a lot of disguises if i wanted to get a shot of a building i would wear a high visibility jacket and roll up in a white van i was never challenged
3321934 at the time my daughter was two or three so i would hide the camera behind her pushchair i suppose theres an ethical issue about filming people without permission but you could argue that everything that takes place in the street is in the public domain
3321935 i wanted to use the tower as a constant to look at social contrasts the building sparked a lot of social divisions when it first appeared it was seen as a monument to this crazy thatcherite idea that you could move the financial heart of london to the isle of dogs
3321936 people are watching films more in the home and its sad that the cinemas role has declined
3321937 you get a very particular experience watching a film with other people if youre seeing something subversive which is different to what you normally get it registers much better

3321951 we have a number of serious concerns about the quality of care being delivered these have been raised both during our own inspections and as a result of complaints we have investigated
3321952 we are currently working extremely closely with the care home management with southern cross and with east lothian council to ensure improvements are made immediately
3321953 ive come on at night and found i was the only nurse on duty i was working with two young care assistants who had very little experience
3321954 following an inspection by the care commission ten days ago we were informed that seven requirements highlighted during a previous inspection have now been met and three partially met
3321955 we will continue working closely with the care commission and east lothian council to ensure the delivery of a quality service to all our residents
3321956 as july 2007 was one of the worst performing months of last year total sales growth of just 1 7 in july 2008 highlights how disappointing a month it was for all retail businesses
3321957 although total retails ales and food sales grew compared to the same period last year the non food sector contracted for the second month in a row the furniture and home related sectors continue to bear the brunt of falling consumer confidence and increasing demands on household budgets
3321958 four of the last five months have now seen negative like for like annual sales growth and in july ever sector except food recorded falls frivolous shopping is off the agenda as most customers concentrate on value and durability and there are few signs the slowdown has yet bottomed out
3321959 doctors say the umbrella traveled through the brain stem and caused his brain to swell
3321960 i see umbrella over took table prob had more force going
3321961 the accident happened in the corner behind me and days later the gate to pool is still locked so no one can enter
3321962 thing there is such a strong wind because the way this place is designed makes it hard to pick up
3321963 the cruises are not intended to look for energy resources that is not a primary or even a secondary objective
3321964 however its inevitable because there are so few data in this area of the arctic there will be great interest in using this data
3321965 ultimately what is going to be needed is a more comprehensive ecological study of that region and some indication as to whether or not any technology that we have today is likely to be able to clean up spilled oil in that set of conditions
3321966 was bad for the arctic but very very good for mapping
3321967 over the last two weeks how often have you been bothered by the following problem thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way
3321968 it is worrying that despite improvements in cancer care a substantial number of patients feel they would be better off dead
3321969 we know that depression is common in patients who have cancer but it is often missed pain is also a big problem treating patients symptoms as well as their disease might improve and even save their lives
3321970 if you play one match then have to play against a fresh player it doesnt seem logical
3321971 ive played in grand slams and olympics and ive never seen that happen before
3321972 obviously its a long way away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the
3321973 its an honour to compete in the olympics its been great
3321974 im playing for a medal but i have to get there first that will be the ultimate goal for me
3321975 i didnt have that little bit of excellence that i had earlier in the season
3321976 i dont have any regrets im going from bronze to silver but im a bit disappointed because i was hoping to get s first gold medal
3321977 i dont come into this race as a huge favourite which is something i like
3321978 im sort of an underdog due to my age and my inexperience im just here exactly for the experience and being a part of the olympic games
3321979 i think he feels a lot better now and hes excited to be here im excited for him to be here as well though he appears unusually composed at a news conference phinneys youth shines through when he mentions that he could not get his parents access to training at the velodrome
3321980 over the course of this year theyve been with me the whole time so coming here and have them distanced from me is a little bit hard
3321981 but im 18 and supposed to be a man so ive got to take care of myself

3321983 denis stupir tutti a suon di gol bogliacino pedina fondamentale di questa squadra
3321984 se il ds marino ha attuato questo tipo di strategia in questi quattro anni di gestione societaria il motivo semplice nella sua precedente esperienza in friuli ha talmente riscosso tanti successi che proseguire in tal senso col napoli stato certamente inevitabile la politica dei piccoli passi alla lunga porta grandi risultati comprare solo un grosso nome non basta lintero collettivo che deve migliorare col tempo anche lo stesso maradona che era un giocatore formidabile dovette pazientare pi di qualche anno per vincere qualcosa in maglia azzurra perch da solo non poteva battere tutte le squadre negli anni poi allodi port a napoli grandissimi campioni e la squadra inizi un ciclo vincente tornando ai giorni nostri credo che con questa strategia il napoli abbia gi fatto intravedere dei buoni risultati nello scorso campionato e ritengo che la stabilit societaria si fondamentale per dare continuit allintero progetto proprio per questo prospetto per gli azzurri un futuro roseo
3321985 certo penso sia migliorato su tutti i punti di vista sul piano tecnico della preparazione atletica e tattica forse la tecnologia ci ha un po allontanati dagli stadi ma in un discorso di comodit credo che a volte sia anche piacevole guardare la partita sul divano di casa di certo le emozioni che trasmette lo stadio non possono essere le stesse trasmesse dal tubo catodico ma in un calcio globale anche questo discorso pu andare bene
3321986 certamente senza alcun dubbio tutte le partite vanno affrontate con la giusta concentrazione altrimenti si rischia di fare figuracce lapproccio alla gara risulter essere fondamentale sia nella partita dandata che al ritorno allo stadio san paolo
3321987 un impressione molto positiva credo che questo giocatore stupir tutti un attaccante completo che fa reparto da solo che se assistito adeguatamente credo possa trovare subito la via del gol perch il gol lo ha nel sangue bisogna dargli per tranquillit modo di ambientarsi col il nostro calcio e il tempo di rifiatare un pochino visto che ha cominciato la preparazione facendo solo pochi giorni di vacanza dopo il termine del torneo di clausura in argentina
3321988 secondo il mio parere il napoli potrebbe anche partire con questi uomini perch li reputo giocatori validissimi che hanno bisogno per di una giusta iniezione di fiducia da tutto lambiente per poter far bene poi logico se i risultati non dovessero essere quelli sperati ci sono sempre i mezzi economici per rimediare e fare dei buonissimi acquisti
3321989 bogliacino in tutti questi anni stato il giocatore con una crescita medio alta ed ha sempre avuto un rendimento costante in tutte le circostanze anche in partite dove stato impiegato in un ruolo non propriamente suo un professionista serio e molto capace
3321990 i confronti non andrebbero mai fatti gianluca stato sfortunatissimo si trovato nel napoli nella stagione che poi coincisa con il fallimento fisicamente non mai stato al top a causa una fastidiosa ernia al disco e questo ha portato la stampa ad accanirsi eccessivamente nei suoi confronti
3321991 i nomi delle favorite sono sempre gli stessi italia brasile e argentina sono le pi serie accreditate alla vittoria finale molto dipender anche dalla condizione fisica fattore che risulter determinante alla vittoria finale

3321999 the iaaf is sending a clear message that we will not tolerate doping
3322000 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3322001 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3322002 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3322003 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3322004 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3322005 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3322006 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3322007 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3322008 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3322009 it was the second straight olympics where the opening ceremony involved lip synching luciano pavarottis performance at the 2006 winter games in turin was prerecorded
3322010 i am reassured after our talks that there will be more people going through the pavilions
3322011 we will be in contact with the sponsors and i hope they will be satisfied
3322012 the complaints were especially sensitive for organizers because companies represented on the green are top tier sponsors of both the ioc and the beijing organizing committee they include japans panasonic and watchmaker omega
3322013 heiberg said that once track and field events start friday in the birds nest the nickname of the national stadium there should be about 150 000 people a day passing through the green an ample audience for sponsors

3322025 theres been a lot of nervousness and a lot of ignorance in terms of developing maori components by non maoir operators im going to be suggesting to the non maori part of this conference that unless we do start collaborating well development of ecotourism in the country wont go as smoothly as it should
3322026 we always knew that nothing had changed since the 1990s when jenny shipley came in slashed benefits they put state house rentals up to market levels and forced people to pay to go to the emergency department of the public hospitals the horror story went on and here they go again
3322027 she says the children of the participants will benefit the most from the three year project
3322028 within another three years we will see a slowing down in the rate of new cases of diabetes but i think the biggest bang for the buck is going to be the children of those women who have taken part how much healthier they are and the children that they have
3322029 well go through a process of asking them to remove themselves from that area recording the situation if they refuse us if they force us to take other actions and that means confiscating their vehicles it may mean perhaps physical confrontations at the extreme we dont want to go there but we are very serious about protecting our resources
3322030 their call for a referendum on mmp is another way that they hope to get rid of the maori seas to do it by stealth what theyll do is ask the country whether there needs to be a change the country will probably say yes and one of the changes theyll more than likely make is to get rid of the maori seats

3322101 e una cosa che non capita a tutti importante avere la possibilit di vivere direttamente latmosfera che si respira in cina per le olimpiadi ho tastato con mano levento la cina ha curato tutto nei minimi dettagli tra coreografia e preparazione delle gare
3322102 ho visto un clima di festa ho avuto la possibilit di viaggiare tanto visto che le partite che ho visionato non erano a pechino girando per la strada noti un clima di festa tipico dei grandi eventi gli stadi sono nuovissimi e noi italiani dobbiamo anche imparare perch le partite sono viste come momenti di festa le famiglie hanno la possibilit di vivere levento con serenit al contrario di quello che avviene dalle nostre parti ho avuto anche il tempo per vedere il brasile che uno spettacolo nello spettacolo
3322103 li ho visti allopera contro la nuova zelanda e sicuramente questanno i tifosi del milan avranno la possibilit di divertirsi ronaldinho il giocatore stellare di qualche stagione fa in forma e motivato allegro e carismatico quindi il campionato si arricchir di una stella mondiale
3322104 sicuramente con inter juventus e roma poi chiaro che i pronostici lasciano il tempo che trovano
3322105 contro lhonduras ho notato una squadra in forma giovinco e rossi sono un gradino sopra gli altri acquafresca bravissimo peccato che rocchi sia ritornato in italia per linfortunio al perone nonostante la sua assenza comunque lundici pu andare avanti anche se bisogna prestare particolare attenzione col camerun perch se perde va a giocarsela contro il brasile occhio perch il camerun una buona squadra
3322106 non pi un emergente un calciatore che sa il fatto suo e ha un certo spessore una certa consistenza non pi un giovane e in questa nazionale olimpica uno dei pi esperti
3322107 le regole che impediscono alle societ italiane di tesserare extracomunitari limitano molto le possibili trattative nel camerun ci sono dei calciatori interessanti ma anche in altre nazionali come quella cinese noi abbiamo aperto un ufficio di rappresentanza a shangai un continente che vogliamo valutare

3322129 it is scandalous that hundreds of thousands of older people may be denied treatment because depression is wrongly seen as a natural part of getting older
3322130 older people deserve better treatment there should be no excuse for inaction
3322131 general practitioners have a key role to play in more effectively pinpointing possible depression as patients present themselves
3322132 care home staff and managers must also ensure their own knowledge of symptoms associated with depression is improved
3322133 skylights also offer much more privacy than vertical windows without taking up valuable wall space that can be used for decorating or storage
3322134 energy star qualified venting skylights admit natural light from above and reduce energy costs while transforming living areas into bright safer spaces and they provide a dose of the medicine that daylight and fresh air offer
3322135 with a one time purchase that pays benefits over time by reducing the need for artificial lighting and cutting energy costs
3322136 we need to be cautious with what were allowing someone to do and at what point in their recovery theyre allowed to do it
3322137 to keep the brain stimulated but not enough to push it into overdrive
3322138 whether its pop warner football or soccer or high school teams
3322139 its difficult for them to realize this one game friday night is not as important as my cognitive ability the rest of my life
3322140 lots of operable windows for natural daylight and free ventilation
3322141 but kitchens are especially enjoyable for family and guests when they are bright cheerful and free of stale cooking odors heat and humidity
3322142 venting skylights can utilize their natural chimney effect to exhaust not only kitchen air but to vent volatile organic compounds vocs and other indoor air pollutants from other areas of the home as well
3322143 it took longer but it worked for me slowly i began to bond with my son and the grey cloud started to lift
3322144 i talked to my family doctor right away and started to take an anti depressant from approximately 18 weeks of pregnancy until my baby was 6 months old
3322145 the medication eased my thoughts and i could feel myself climbing out of the well i had been stuck in for so long but the true help came in the form of a mothers support group the power of hearing other women who had suffered and recovered from postpartum mood disorders made all the difference in the world
3322146 if i have one message to tell new mothers it would be to talk about how they feel understand that they are not alone and take advantage of the help that is available
3322147 i wasnt really sad i was just really really tired i never had thoughts of harming my baby they were more hallucinogenic in nature like visualizing the electric wires in the walls of my home and being afraid of getting electrocuted i started having panic attacks and these were supposedly the symptoms of postpartum mood disorder i was confused
3322148 some of them had dark thoughts some were weepy some just didnt feel like themselves but not one of them had shared these stories with each other or with me they didnt want to scare me
3322149 whats so ironic is that the more we talked about it the more it helped me women need to talk about this by sharing our stories we feel less stigma less fear and we can be more sympathetic to ourselves and to others
3322150 this experience really made me think about the rite of motherhood in our society
3322151 in some other cultures the new mother rests and nurses for the first 12 weeks which they consider to be the fourth trimester they are cared for and fed by the other women in the village and are able to slowly grow into their new role as mother ancestor and caregiver so often our women are alone after they give birth i dont know how i could have gotten through my postpartum experience without the support of my family
3322152 women are excessive caregivers after they give birth they need to change their focus to caring for themselves their baby and their marriage other demands must be put on the backburner
3322153 this type of surgery is done to improve patients quality of life
3322154 so if the surgery can result in another type of debilitating pain afterwards its important for patients to know this in advance
3322155 people are having too much unrelieved pain after cardiac surgery
3322156 we are encouraging them to tell nurses and doctors when they are hurting and take pain medications regularly to prevent moderate to severe pain
3322157 at any given time nearly three million canadians have serious depression but less than one third seek help having new treatment options is always encouraging for patients in their fight to get well and stay well
3322158 with depression there can be a wide range of symptoms that may be emotional as well as physical
3322159 these symptoms could be emotional including sadness loss of interest in activities thoughts of death or suicide or physical such as fatigue sleep disturbances and even aches and pains
3322160 a tropical depression could form during the next day or so as the system moves west northwestward at about 15 mph
3322161 a tropical depression could form within this area during the next day or two as it moves westward at about 10 mph
3322162 in my view our poor performance is not the result of poor economic conditions
3322163 much of our operating shortfall i believe is the result of our own lack of execution as a company that began in the midst of the great depression we have a deep heritage from one of the great american brands and are fortunate to have attracted committed and passionate employees benefits that we believe will allow us once again to become a thriving chain

3322233 the shortfall in wind power generated could be due to lack of availability of land for wind farms and the currently planned captive consumption could be used by others if government provides transmission facilities

3322254 i thought its a small step then to have an imaginary character like sue and create a narrative for her doctors who look for that narrative are able to write because they create that story for patients
3322255 immediately when a patient comes in im noticing things about them such as if theyre a smoker or whether they bite their nails in medical school youre taught to observe really well and of course good writing is all about picking up on those small details that attention to detail lifts ordinary writing to the extraordinary

3322279 in any case it is not a part of our political culture or foreign policy to topple anyone or put someone on a throne
3322280 we can hardly agree with this because it would assume the presence of people described as georgian peacekeepers they can no longer remain
3322281 they committed crimes and shot at comrades with whom they served in the same peacekeeping unit
3322282 not just holding negotiations with saakashvili but simply talking to him
3322283 but our general approach is that mr saakashvili can no longer be our partner it would be better if he went
3322284 this means the solidarity of five states with the nation that has fallen victim to aggression
3322285 we may say that the russian state has once again shown its face its true face

3322296 the route more or less follows the line of the existing road but on three occasions it meanders slightly it veers to the east of the trees then at wee frosses it goes to the west side of the trees and at one other location it veers off the line
3322297 i am pleased to confirm the preferred route for this strategically important road scheme the a26 frosses road dualling between glarryford and the a44 drones road junction will improve road safety and reduce journey times benefiting both the travelling public and the business community the improvement will also enhance tourist links for this area
3322298 we will continue to develop the design for this important road scheme in preparation for progressing the project through the necessary environmental planning and land acquisition statutory procedures affected landowners and other interested parties will continue to be individually consulted as part of the process
3322299 depending on the type and number of objections received the regional development minister may decide to hold a public inquiry

3322306 our problem now is we cant get in because of the security aspect we are being prevented from going in by the international committee of the red cross because of the unstable situation
3322307 but we are preparing for a big rush of food and medicine and all things that they need
3322308 i dont see this always as an area of problems
3322309 i see this as an area of possibilities where we think about historic neighbourhoods and what they provided to the city what they provided to the province
3322310 and if we look at those things and work on them as an integrated way i think you will see significant improvements by 2010
3322311 theres no better way to promote all our province has to offer than through the eyes of journalists drawn here by the games
3322312 i think were going to be able to better than that
3322313 sheikh azizs death is big loss to kashmir nation we will take his mission to its logical end
3322314 the first thing is the whole event is very undesirable in terms of both the domestic situation in jammu and kashmir and its linkage with the larger bilateral peace process
3322315 i see this will have a bad impact and considering that pakistan is going through a bad turmoil now the overall impact on the peace process will not be very positive
3322316 giving others the freedom to be stupid is one of the most important and hardest steps to take in spiritual progress conveniently the opportunity to take that step is all around us every day
3322317 if i am really in charge why cant i cut a few corners use less expensive materials and put the extra money in my pocket who would know the difference after we paint the place no one would be able to tell
3322318 this is incredible you did a fantastic job you have been such a good and faithful worker and have been so honest all of these years that i am showing my gratitude by giving you this house
3322319 what besides the most bad ass fuckin arrangement of these letters is this design from
3322320 yeah thats bad ass im all about that when do you want to start next week
3322321 if at first you dont succeed call it version 1 0
3322322 each production that we have brought to the nsmt mainstage this season has been unique and spelling bee is no exception
3322323 set in a school gymnasium spelling bee takes a hilarious and heartwarming look at the pressures of growing up through the eyes of quirky yet lovable characters competing for the title of spelling bee champ were pleased to present this production whose witty and endearing music and lyrics are created by massachusetts own
3322324 if orphan annie is the one recollection you have of andrea then you are in for a glorious surprise although embedded forever in our hearts as the red headed orphan in the red dress with the big belt voice andrea has continued her extraordinary career on and off the broadway stages with a unique talent perspective and energy in her show she revisits some of her favorite broadway musical memories from the many shows shes starred in and she takes us on a great journey with her very entertaining and surprising backstage stories she also reveals her natural musical instincts in contemporary pop and jazz and even teases us with hints of broadway roles yet to come
3322325 lou was really looking forward to his starring role in our production and hopes to return to fort worth again soon
3322326 richard brings a sense of gleeful silliness to the role of the devil we are looking forward to his performance
3322327 what is clear is that the extremes have been strengthened
3322328 were in the same position as before the referendum but more polarized and with more profound differences
3322329 the national polarization has never been as clearly demarcated as now
3322330 that is the question that will define the immediate future
3322331 it is time to deepen in a democratic way the transformation of the nation
3322332 im very relieved ill go off now and get a good nights sleep
3322333 ive been granted a second chance now the luck went with me a little bit with this so i just hope i can take something from it and have a good crack at it now
3322334 im still slightly annoyed that i put myself in this position
3322335 i think mentally i was pretty strong today but i held it together after the first run and knew it was not an impossible task for me to pull it back
3322336 i would say the semi final course will suit eoin a bit better because theres more chance to use the water which hes good at
3322337 something like this always costs mental energy which is precious
3322338 theres a lot at stake so you try anything to get away with it
3322339 you play the rules and you play them to the end
3322340 we wanted to keep ahead and offer our clients something different and try and keep their carbon footprint down so we went down the environmentally friendly route using green products and materials
3322341 its an environmentally friendly treatment that can eradicate bacteria and viruses such as mrsa it can also completely sanitises toys and childrens play areas
3322342 in confrontations on monday troops killed 26 ltte terrorists and 29 were wounded
3322343 knew how to treat performers how to talk to them to get them to do things even if they didnt want to
3322344 lazy hands make a man poor but diligent hands bring wealth
3322345 every morning in africa a gazelle wakes up it knows it must run faster than the fastest lion or it will be killed every morning a lion wakes up it knows it must outrun the slowest gazelle or it will starve to death it doesnt matter whether you are a lion or a gazelle when the sun comes up you had better be running
3322346 courage to start and willingness to keep everlasting at it are the requisites for success
3322347 it is better by noble boldness to run the risk of being subject to half the evils we anticipate than to remain in cowardly listlessness for fear of what might happen
3322348 i have always been delighted at the prospect of a new day a fresh try one more start with perhaps a bit of magic waiting somewhere behind the morning
3322349 i consider fear and loathing in las vegas to be comfort reading i like the al pastor tacos at tacos mexico and i count among my literary influences the chainsaw from doom
3322350 you know what well take our chances with the jerks with the guns
3322351 yeah thats the amp who told me to get down on the floor told me to get down on a floor in an oakland restaurant without even letting me put saran wrap down first me with a wife and two kids i hope he fries

3322356 we zullen nu alles in het werk stellen om het vertrouwen van de pati nten terug te winnen
3322357 we willen het hele systeem van bescherming van wilsonbekwame personen en goederen doorzichtiger eenvoudiger en soepeler maken
3322358 daarom stellen we voor om alles te bundelen in n overzichtelijke regeling dit zal de vrederechter toelaten om op maat van de wilsonbekwame persoon de voor hem meest passende bescherming uit te werken we behouden alle positieve punten uit de bestaande systemen en werken de tekorten weg
3322359 vanuit ethisch oogpunt moeten we vertrekken vanuit de mogelijkheden en het recht op zelfbeschikking van elke mens we moeten echter ook rekening houden met zijn handicap en kwetsbaarheid het vinden van een respectvolle en veilige bescherming vraagt een individuele en specifieke benadering vooral wat de persoon nog zelf kan doen moet aangemoedigd worden
3322360 la magia existe siempre y cuando uno crea en ella
3322361 our ability to strategically engage at the international level is necessary we shall seek greater engagement at the regional and international level through bodies such as east africa securities regulators association easra
3322362 we are currently working with the treasury and cbk to engage viable state corporations to positively consider and issue infrastructure bonds as an avenue of raising capital
3322363 our direction will be to engage different providers of unit trust and also to ensure the public and investors have access to value adding information that facilitates effective comparison of the unit trusts
3322364 were not doing well and while others were vandalized and abandoned
3322365 chc is responsible for following up and ensuring that investors adhere to agreements under which they purchased the respective public enterprises failure of which tantamounts to repossession
3322366 we have started identifying them the non performers and the investors would be notified of the next move

3322370 inflation is impacting on the economy differently in different sectors
3322371 food manufacturing for example is being squeezed leading to severe job losses
3322372 other sectors like oil and energy are printing inflation by hiking prices
3322373 even when their costs are falling they are slow to pass these lower prices to consumers
3322374 motorists can see that there is 7 to 8 pence difference per litre in the price of diesel between petrol stations across the country this is just a rip off
3322375 action must be taken against this profiteering action must also be taken to stop damaging speculation in the oil market
3322376 if action is not taken it is inevitable that wages will have to rise in response to these higher prices
3322377 the rise in consumer price inflation to a series high of 4 4 in july was well above expectations furthermore the rise cannot be attributed solely to sharply higher food and energy prices this is a really disturbing set of data that will not go down at all well at the bank of england
3322378 even with the recent drop in oil prices it still looks possible that inflation will hit 5 within two or three months as the latest round of utility price hikes affects the index
3322379 kindle integrated primary school has served the ballykinler community for many years and i recognise this is a sad occasion for all involved
3322380 unfortunately the continued decline in enrolments at the school had resulted in a total enrolment of 31 in 2007 8 only four of which were year 1 pupils the south eastern education and library board therefore considered that the schools position was no longer sustainable i do fully appreciate and empathise with the concerns expressed by parents and local representatives in the two month objection period which followed publication of the development proposal
3322381 who over the years have provided a dedicated and professional educational service
3322382 she is the youngest in the team and it was great to see her do so well especially as she only had her transplant in december she thoroughly enjoyed herself and i am so happy for her it is great to see all the team back home today with their medals because they have all done us proud and the whole event was fantastic
3322383 it was our olympics we all had a great time and loved every minute of it
3322384 the whole team performed excellently and are an inspiration for anyone
3322385 it was great to see so many people of all age ranges taking part and giving it their best northern ireland was one of the most successful teams in the competition which is organised to raise awareness about organ donation and to encourage transplant patients to regain fitness
3322386 there is always a need for individuals to register as an organ donor and just seeing the joy that was brought to all these people in sheffield just shows how worthwhile organ donation really is
3322387 the united states has long expressed concerns about government financial support for the launch of commercial aircraft and has pursued this issue with the europeans in the wto
3322388 washington will take a very careful look at the support announced by canada quebec and the uk to ensure they do not distort the market for commercial airliners or contravene wto rules
3322389 government support for aircraft manufacturing can be expected to attract some international scrutiny
3322390 is subject to eu commission approvals under normal competition rules
3322391 are you talking to me pointing at his face do you read an expression of disappointment come on im the vice olympic champion
3322392 my ambition has always been to play for my national team and i believe that playing in the biggest league in the world for aston villa will help me realise that
3322393 everyone in the newspapers was saying i was going to sunderland or aston villa but i only ever wanted to come here as soon as i knew they were interested i said i want to come i came here because the manager has wanted me for two years i met him when i was at auxerre and i like the man because he gives you confidence
3322394 ivan has a wealth of experience having played at the highest level for many years and he can be a great asset for us
3322395 the young players at this club will really benefit from having him around the place
3322396 its a very expensive option but again it would be an option if we were allowed to speak to the lad
3322397 but that in itself can bring its own pressures too i know that better than most from my experience in seoul you dont want to be the first irish fighter coming back to the village defeated
3322398 weve had a good look at that video and it was a very very close fight
3322399 john joe is a very clever fighter very good at holding a lead and only the cleanest punches are getting marked here
3322400 but i have to admit i was concerned about how he looked up on the platform he has a habit of showing tension by drawing his hands down across his face but yesterday it was excessive also the way he was sponging himself down after every dive i worried how his pulse was running
3322401 we need to give tom a little space we have to let him breathe its not just about his training its about the need for him to go to school an education is important to a young boy its a fair point to say that a lot of pressure has been applied to him in publicity in commercial activity and yes i agree there is a tendency in british sport to build too much on potential and expect it to automatically turn into achievement winning is hard but to keep on winning that is the hardest thing there has been so much focus on tom and you have to think how much better it is for athletes when they win without so much expectation as nicole cooke and rebecca adlington have done for tom it is a case of coming into the real world today
3322402 it was disappointing but it was a great experience i really enjoyed myself i had so much fun
3322403 tom said what are you on the phone for were in competition and weve got another dive to do this is tom just being over nervous thats how it was today tom should not be worrying about what im doing today he was worrying about everyone and everything and that is really the sole reason why he didnt perform today
3322404 when my parents told me i might be going to the olympics i thought it couldnt be true
3322405 when my friends at school heard the news they thought i was playing a joke on them
3322406 i didnt blow anything and so i can go home happy with my performance
3322407 but unfortunately its a partnership you both have to be on the top of your game i wasnt on the top of my game but tom was nowhere near the top of his
3322408 i knew we were capable of a medal but i knew it would depend on how tom performed i out dived thomas today and thats not something that normally happens and that to me is because tom had a lot more pressure on him than i did tom was very nervous more so than ever before and i think he really struggled to get through the competition
3322409 peking tom why everyones looking at this 14 year old darling diver
3322410 i think thats the sole reason why it went the way it did
3322411 i saw my mum in the audience and i asked her to give me a call and tom went to me why are you on the phone
3322412 that is thomas over nervous that is how it was today today he was worrying about everyone and everything and that to me is the sole reason why he didnt perform today
3322413 i was quite disappointed but it was a great experience and i really enjoyed myself i had so much fun out there thats all you can ask getting the experience
3322414 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare
3322415 this is the west sir when the legend becomes fact print the legend
3322416 the first race ended up being a good one and im not sure if i won because it was especially close with three boats on the line
3322417 on the second race i didnt have such a good start and really just couldnt get out of the fleet on the first beat and rounded about 10th
3322418 but everyones been a bit up and down zach was pretty consistent again today and hes doing really well keeping that up but theres still a long way to go
3322419 it will be good to have the day off because its so hot here
3322420 the first two years are still a practice phase and it makes sense to have a lower permille limit during this time
3322421 even though these results are very good they may also show that children today live lives where critics may say that they are overprotected
3322422 had a misguided and untrue view on sexuality where a woman with a dildo is seen as liberated strong and independent whereas a man with a blow up plastic vagina is viewed as disgusting and perverted
3322423 as i understand it there are no products of good quality for men on the market should there be such products specifically for men then there is nothing stopping us from selling them

3322454 if you wanted to cover the unfunded liability of all three medicaid programs today you would be stuck with an 85 6 trillion bill that is more than six times as large as the bill for social security it is more than six times the annual output of the entire u s economy
3322455 add together the unfunded liabilities from medicare and social security and it comes to 99 2 trillion over the infinite horizon traditional medicare composes about 69 percent the new drug benefit roughly 17 percent and social security the remaining 14 percent
3322456 i want to remind you that i am only talking about the unfunded portions of social security and medicare
3322457 lets say you and i and bruce ericson and every u s citizen who is alive today decided to fully address this unfunded liability through lump sum payments from our own pocketbooks so that all of us and all future generations could be secure in the knowledge that we and they would receive promised benefits in perpetuity how much would we have to pay if we split the tab again the math is painful with a total population of 304 million from infants to the elderly the per person payment to the federal treasury would come to 330 000 this comes to 1 3 million per family of four over 25 times the average households income
3322458 no combination of tax hikes and spending cuts though will change the total burden borne by current and future generations
3322459 we know from centuries of evidence in countless economies from ancient rome to todays zimbabwe that running the printing press to pay off todays bills leads to much worse problems later on
3322460 earlier i mentioned the feds dual mandate to manage growth and inflation
3322461 purging rampant inflation and a debased currency requires administering a harsh medicine we have been there and we know the cure that was wrought by the fomc under paul volcker even the perception that the fed is pursuing a cheap money strategy to accommodate fiscal burdens should it take root is a paramount risk to the long term welfare of the u s economy the federal reserve will never let this happen it is not an option ever period

3322465 both the cpn m and nc have urged us to lead the next government but we are stressing forming a national consensus government incorporating at least four major parties

3322508 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3322509 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation
3322510 the uncertain near term outlook for global financial markets and potential changes in regulatory capital requirements
3322511 our review has clearly revealed the weaknesses associated with the integrated one firm business model
3322512 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months

3322524 flowers is one thing that weve seen looked like it appeared to be wild flowers and a grassy area

3322528 aberdeen fans can face the new season with a high degree of optimism one can never read too much into pre season friendlies but an astonishing reverse at the hands of the blue toon notwithstanding the lads have done fantastically well
3322529 a fine showing against the champions of europe and victory over dutch cracks vitesse arnhem suggests we have little to fear from anything the spl can throw at us
3322530 id also like to see nakamuras understudy mizuno warm a first team bench until he is required at pivotal moments of matches
3322531 this season could be the one where he demonstrates some real coaching talent perhaps we will realise that getting points away from home in europe doesnt have to be pretty
3322532 ive been attending the temple that is tannadice park for about 40 years im 50 and live in dundee
3322533 i attend virtually every home game and about half the away games i go to games with guys i have known for more years than i care to remember and my son sean aged 11 usually attends the games with me
3322534 im looking forward to the new season and am confident we can improve on last seasons fifth place pre season has gone well except for a 45 minute hammering by barcelona whizzkid lionel messi
3322535 its been a great boost to secure willo flood for another year and the new strikers of sandaza feeney and shala mean that noel hunt wont be missed too much
3322536 the loss of kalvenes was a blow but we have good cover for left back and i have been particularly impressed by the new signing scott robertson from the wee team across the road
3322537 at last the new season is about to get under way and everyone connected to the bairns is fired up and ready for a season
3322538 i hope john hughes and his backroom crew will lead the club to the next level and a top six finish
3322539 yogi has been a shrewd operator in the transfer market grabbing no fewer than 10 new faces to strengthen and expand our very youthful squad
3322540 the injection of experience in the form of neil mccann jackie mcnamara lee bullen and stevie lovell should lead to the consistency we have maybe lacked in the past
3322541 but one thing that will not change is the commitment to a flowing passing game but hopefully with an added killer touch in front of goal
3322542 at the core of the clubs continuing development is of course our own youth development policy
3322543 already we have seen the likes of darren barr scott arfield and tom scobbie breakthrough and gain international honours
3322544 and following on we seem to be brimming with potential so look out for chris mitchell keven moffat mark staunton and mark stewart to name just a few who may make the breakthrough into the first team
3322545 however its just as likely that we will struggle for the top 6 and who knows maybe even worse
3322546 its all very well hearing about the new togetherness within the squad but with no new striker to put the ball in the back of the net we will be left not killing off games like last season that we should have won one thing i know for certain is that this year is make or break for vladimir romanov in the eyes of many jambos contrary to what you read in the media the majority of us rightly or wrongly still hope that he can deliver and bring the good times back time nearly ran out for vlad last year but the general consensus is that we give him one more chance to get it right so to conclude what would represent a successful season well europe has to be the aim with the big cup back at tynie is it likely well my money is still firmly in my back pocket and the bookies arent getting near it this year
3322547 given that its the anniversary of dads army which member of the cast would be a stick on hibs supporter at least according to the scottish media
3322548 were doomed doomed yep an army of private frasers are at this moment shuffling along easter road hands in pockets kicking solitary pebbles into a dusty gutter
3322549 barcelona stuffed us middlesborough did us over after we surrendered a two goal lead wigan threw us off the end of the pier and as for cowdenbeath hibs played as if they were in a stock car heading downhill with no brakes no steering and murray walker commentating
3322550 the role of manager at easter road must be the most unenviable job in scotland sorry i forgot about the race for the leadership of the scottish labour party
3322551 do you know what i dont really care these are friendlies the manager shouldnt get panned for friendlies were not celtic
3322552 im happy to wait until the spl actually gets under way league results are all that count
3322553 the season ahead is our most challenging we need to get off to a good start and i think that the opening fixtures give us opportunity to do that
3322554 im confident we will carry a good scoring threat this season it was a blow to lose striker marius niculae but one player does not make a team and weve recovered from losing important players in the past like darren dods and midfielder john rankin
3322555 who knows perhaps the next marius niculae is just round the corner in any case caley fans have high hopes for new signing andy barrowman this season
3322556 id still like to see manager craig brewster make a few more signings before the transfer window closes our backline needs strengthening
3322557 the squad at inverness has always been very close knit team and they gel very early weve also had one of our best ever pre seasons so im optimistic about the new season
3322558 success would be a top six finish craig brewster is about to begin his first full season in charge at the club hes still relatively new to management and if he gets backing from the board he can do well
3322559 hell be aiming for a top six finish and come the split i dont think well be far away
3322560 if last season is anything to go by then any place above eleventh can be construed as a moral victory this time out
3322561 traditionally killie seem to operate in three year cycles so now our bad year is out of the way we can hopefully look forward to a couple of good seasons and boy do we need it
3322562 the money situation as always will dictate a lot of what happens down rugby park way this term but im well aware that we are not the only club who are struggling financially so we have as good a chance as any of the other teams out with the old firm of doing some damage
3322563 we had real problems with injuries and a lack of squad depth but the gaffer seems to be trying to address that situation by making a few summer signings
3322564 the fans are delighted that mehdi taouil has extended his contract as the wee man is a joy to watch and with craig bryson due back to full fitness after his operation we can look forward to a lot more from the midfield area
3322565 pascali will give us some much needed bite in front of the defence and up front we have introduced a man that will have the headline writers jumping for joy conor sammon
3322566 i have the feeling that jj is not finished yet and we may well see a few more new faces at the theatre of pies before the curtain raises against the hibees
3322567 all we need now is some news that a major investor has been found and we can have a board of directors to steer the club once more
3322568 i hope we can keep a hold of mark mcghee and give him the transfer funds to enable him to bring in a few more signings
3322569 a good season would see us having a good go at the uefa cup group stages and go on a couple of good domestic cup runs im not asking for much
3322570 david clarkson has been brilliant for us and was superb last season hes given so much to the club for someone so young keith lasley is very much under rated
3322571 with such a gap and a bag of games in hand it really only was ours to throw away and that we did
3322572 give up trying to make the lad run about all day let someone else do it give him the ball and he will put it away
3322573 not many home games stick in the memory from last season and our lack of goals 26 the lowest in the spl by some margin proved perhaps that we were trying to not lose games rather than win them
3322574 however our away form has never really been the problem all too often good performances at tynecastle easter road and parkhead were followed up by lacklustre home defeats to sides we should be beating

3322576 ive seen a determination about ishmael he wants to be a premier league player
3322577 they all want to be premier league players but some stick their chests out and believe this is where they deserve to be
3322578 now he needs to go and prove it out on the field ishmael has shown in pre season a desire to do that
3322579 once we get underway at the weekend well find out whether he can transfer the desire
3322580 it would be massive for me to play in the first team again for mccarthy to say a couple of the younger players will play shows hes going to give people a chance to impress
3322581 if i start or come off the bench ill be giving 110 per cent ive played at molineux under lights before and its brilliant something you want to do all the time
3322582 they will be everywhere about us and in our faces they play in red and all youll see is red shirts
3322583 youve got to deal with that and hopefully our ability will shine through
3322584 i was actually playing for northampton against millwall the night of the morecambe game when the result came through i was shocked because id been expecting a big win for wolves as you would do
3322585 it happens in football who would have expected cardiff to get to the fa cup final last season
3322586 i should hope the lads were guarding against complacency even before the morecambe game
3322587 we played stafford last week and automatically a fan would say we should hammer these
3322588 thats not necessarily the case because its their cup final they will be playing out of their skin and trying their hardest to get one over on us
3322589 players marking you want to make sure we dont go anywhere because they will want to leave their mark and make an impression
3322590 but weve got the ability and the players to beat them
3322591 it is not just about politics councillors wanted that proposal to fail for the good of the community
3322592 i spent a lot of time speaking to people in the area about the plans particularly chapel street residents who would have been opposite the arcade
3322593 all of them said they didnt want the arcade because they were concerned about anti social behaviour it may cause
3322594 arcades by their very nature will attract the younger element of the community and it may cause a problem
3322595 i was cynical as to whether they would be able to monitor that the people going in would be 18 and over
3322596 the other concern was if underaged people did get in and win they would take their winnings next door to the off license
3322597 the local police have enough work to do without another problem
3322598 an arcade just will not be suitable for that particular area
3322599 we would like to thank the public for the support they have shown this year
3322600 despite the considerable rain throughout the weekend we had a total of 275 visitors
3322601 this was our last 2008 garden charity open day and in such adverse weather conditions we were delighted to raise such a good amount
3322602 we have had people who have made special trips from bournemouth paignton and as far away as california since we began opening our garden in 2006 we have now had more than 3 180 visitors raising in excess of 9 180 for charity
3322603 this is alarming here we have a set of buildings that look like a full scale airport terminal
3322604 to legitimise a practice that has been allowed to go on illegally for years
3322605 this is development by stealth this is an attempt to sneak things through the back door
3322606 its not difficult to put up a hangar and convert it into a passenger terminal
3322607 its not like how it used to be you know its absolutely full of ordinary middle class people like me
3322608 the four suspects got out of the vehicle and one of them turned towards the police officer it is presumed that the man was holding a fire arm police then fired shots at the suspects who fled into the bushes dog units were sent out but none of the suspects could be found
3322609 as soon as he lezak came off that last wall i started going crazy were a team we went in as a team and now were exiting as a team and were going out with that gold that we needed to get back
3322610 i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional
3322611 jason finished that race better than we could even ask for
3322612 ive been on the last two relays where we come up short
3322613 to be honest with you i got really tired of losing i finished real strong
3322614 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganised
3322615 there is no doubt it has done us the world of good we thought our first group game would be massive and we can gain a lot of confidence from it
3322616 no one is expecting us to beat holland and we definitely play better when we dont have to worry about that
3322617 i am absolutely delighted with the riders and with the way the horses coped with the course
3322618 we now need to make sure the horse are ok and ready for tomorrow when they come out to jump we certainly wont go down without a fight while the pressure is on the teams above us to stay there
3322619 the questions come thick and fast but i had an enjoyable ride where i managed to get into a good rhythm he parkmore ed has a long stride which worked to our advantage he was fabulous and finished really well he is a super horse
3322620 i was very emotional at the end and just looked to the sky and thought arent i lucky to be doing this
3322621 call again cavalier is a great jumper and whatever happens tomorrow the best horse will win
3322622 we want to arm firms with information so they can start improving their retention and promotion of women
3322623 we think it is important for attorneys to have balanced lives
3322624 we try to be aware of the needs of all our attorneys to help them with their family life
3322625 in the past generation we have seen a slower pace of progress than we thought we would
3322626 my ambition has always been to play for my national team and i believe that playing in the biggest league in the world for aston villa will help me realise that
3322627 if we are going to have any sort of impact we need the squad we just dont have it we definitely need the squad building and thats something we intend to do in the next week or so
3322628 i was walking along the street with my cousin when he came towards us
3322629 he pulled a six inch bladed knife out of his pocket and moved it through the air in front of my body my cousin pushed me over to the grass because he was going to stab me the knife did not touch or cut me and he said you were lucky
3322630 i had got a knife at the time but did not produce it she knew i carried knives
3322631 mortgage lending activity remains relatively weak and will decline further in the coming months as a result of funding constraints and lower consumer demand
3322632 this is one of the biggest fires within the birmingham area we have dealt with for some time the fire was in a rear extension of the building but using offensive firefighting techniques we managed to prevent it spreading
3322633 it is sad to see the building like this after being here so long it is horrible
3322634 we did ask ask motorists if possible to try and avoid the area around hagley road
3322635 firefighters were carrying out investigations this morning and said so far there was no suggestion as to whether or not the fire was started as a result of an arson attack
3322636 this is a 100 per cent affordable housing scheme the final split of houses and apartments is to be confirmed following further discussions with dudley council
3322637 the site has been redundant for the past 10 years
3322638 with the lack of government housing being provided theres even more of an emphasis on affordable housing
3322639 we have been in close consultation with dudley council and we hope to have everything sorted out by this side of christmas
3322640 the main objective is to produce a closely knit environment that has a common theme with the existing housing in the street
3322641 we have used the civic bar in the past but it doesnt always work
3322642 this will be a wonderful intimate cavern like room for up and coming bands and comedians who dont always want massive spaces to fill
3322643 it needs to keep its charm and not be one of those sterile places
3322644 devon is killing me its so boring i need to be in london where its all happening
3322645 three long years and your favourite man is that any way to say hello
3322646 oh cmon and have a drink with me sit down and talk a while
3322647 oh i wish i could and i will but now i just dont have the time
3322648 it ends sometime and this could be the last i should really hear you sing again and i should really watch you dance
3322649 everybody just assumed that because this deal was cut nobody was going in
3322650 we were letting their defence come out with the ball we were lethargic in other games but if you are against a different class today its going to hurt you and it did
3322651 we probably should have had a couple of goals before the last goal chance before the end when one of the cork players got a block on a shot by dermot earley
3322652 we missed the first penalty and i dont know how youd describe our performance in the first 20 minutes i know from being out there how one little slip can created things concession of scores like that
3322653 the scores that were got in the second half by both teams is just a testimony to the players out there
3322654 we dont talk about the players that we having played our games we dont appreciate enough what players have to go through in those kind of conditions and the pressure at this time of the year
3322655 we had a situation with michael cussen in the munster final and we assume that teams are going to target us in certain areas
3322656 we have a number of options and felt daniel would suit the job today
3322657 we probably should have had a couple of goals before the last goal chance before the end when one of the cork players got a block on a shot by dermot earley
3322658 we missed the first penalty and i dont know how youd describe our performance in the first 20 minutes
3322659 i know from being out there how one little slip can create things concession of scores like that
3322660 you cannot lose five wickets in the first 40 overs of a test
3322661 that happened to us quite regularly in this series which is something we need to think about
3322662 the batsmen did not do well and that cost us the series the middle order not getting the runs proved critical our batting was never consistent
3322663 even in galle where we were 170 for no loss and should have made 400
3322664 it is not sachin tendulkar and sourav ganguly alone it is important for everyone to contribute the middle and lower order let us down
3322665 overall we did not play quality cricket to win the series
3322666 for a new batsman to go in straight away and face two spinners is never easy
3322667 people got starts if they had converted it would have been a different story i do not want to give excuses
3322668 it was not easy to pick runs when mendis and murali were bowling together the pressure they created made it tough mendis is no mystery but it was a great effort to pick 26 wickets
3322669 the bowlers poured their hearts out and it was tough on them
3322670 ishant sharma was brilliant zaheer khan showed a lot of character and bhajjis harbhajan singh performance after what had happened to him in the last two months was exceptional
3322671 it was a very hard series and it drained a lot out of us
3322672 i thought the difference was that we had contributions from different players in the series whenever we needed someone to put their hand up they did
3322673 we knew we had to control those guys in the middle because thats where their nucleus is
3322674 i kept well within myself and there is more to come now for the semi final
3322675 i have got to get into the top three and qualify for that a final this is the big one now
3322676 i guess it has taken me eight years to get here i wasnt too emotional out on the water we have our own agenda in the boat and i just tried to focus on that
3322677 when the whole thing is finished whatever result we get that is when it will all kick in
3322678 but it is brilliant fun to be here it is an experience you wouldnt get anywhere else partridge has managed to leave the emotional turmoil of 2004 behind
3322679 sometimes in the build up to the olympics you see pictures on television of that crew crossing the line and the thing that strikes me is how close the finish was
3322680 that is how close it can be to win a gold medal but we are prepared for that
3322681 mickey always has us well prepared there is no doubt about that although we have had injuries this year we have several people back on board now and i think we can reach a higher level of performance
3322682 you could not ask for a bigger incentive than to produce the goods against dublin in an all ireland quarter final at croke park 2
3322683 this is a big chance for us to show that we really have the hunger and the skill to go all the way obviously we are happy to have won three qualifier ties but you are always judged on the quality of the opposition you play against
3322684 ourselves dublin kerry cork and wexford are still in the hunt for sam and there is very little to choose between the sides i think that the winners of next saturdays game will find themselves viewed as being in with an even better chance of becoming all ireland champions maybe
3322685 yes the atmosphere will be electric but a lot of us have been playing in this kind of environment before now so it will not be new we know what is expected from us and it is up to us to produce the goods
3322686 mickey harte has been working very hard lately and while some of our displays may not have been out of the top drawer we are still in the frame and thats what really matters at the end of the day
3322687 as we have gone through this season we have become more settled and confident
3322688 croke park is the biggest stage of all and its where players really want to produce their best if we can manage this then we will hopefully be in with a great chance of reaching the semi finals
3322689 hey this is what ive been up to howre you
3322690 if i had these feelings or thoughts about my boss and company what would i do
3322691 i can just tell theyre not interested in hearing anything i have to say so why even bother i just need some prospects who will give me a chance
3322692 het bedrijf stond op het punt daarvan vruchten te plukken toen de bouw en huizenmarkt in de vs instortte de dollar afzwakte en de economische groei vertraagde
3322693 externe factoren zijn verslechterd maar we verwachten dat csm hier goed mee om heeft kunnen gaan
3322694 wij geloven dat csm in staat is hogere kosten door te berekenen aan zijn klanten hoewel een zekere vertraging niet kan worden uitgesloten
3322695 i feel that i am giving them support although i cannot make it to beijing to see them in competition and i am also not able to meet them in person it is like giving them my best wishes just to be able to take a photograph with their wax figure
3322696 just to be able to take a photograph with the wax figures of such sporting stars we will feel proud when they win a medal when they win it feels like i am winning too we are all chinese people
3322697 i was known as lazarus but they call me sicknote now
3322698 im hoping thats all behind me i had two groin operations in april then for three weeks i didnt really do anything as the wound was healing
3322699 after that i started recovery work in the gym and ive been training all summer
3322700 i went to spain for three weeks and the physio came out with me so we were training together it was good to have a change of scenery away from the training ground and it was good to spend a bit of time with the family
3322701 i dont like talking about the injuries too much because i dont want to tempt fate but i felt like i had to work through the summer this year i just wanted to get myself firing for the start of the season
3322702 it has been so frustrating since then especially considering previous to that i had gone so many seasons barely missing a game
3322703 it has been difficult to get my head around it
3322704 ive just turned 32 in april which in goalkeeping terms is still quite young so im hoping that my best years are still ahead of me
3322705 you look at brad friedel who has just moved to villa at the age of 37 and david james has probably just had the best season of his career at a similar age
3322706 these are places nobodys gone before in essence so this is a first step
3322707 italian fencer vezzali bags third individual gold in a row
3322708 livet er som en snebold det vigitigste er at finde v dt sne og en rigtig lang bakke
3322709 when i was nine the doctor told me to get out in the fresh air and play football cricket and tennis and that would help me get better and since then ive played them all my life
3322710 i prefer playing singles to doubles i can do my own thing but with doubles youre playing for your partner in the last 12 months of my time in the raf i was playing tennis in egypt everyday in 108c
3322711 it is something im proud of its kept myself going especially when my wife passed away nine years ago and at my age im not in bad shape
3322712 youve got something in you that still needs healing bub wake up
3322713 me too i own a manufacturing business and were backlogged on some orders for our biggest customer ive got to smooth things over or well lose them what about you
3322714 im a coach most recently a fortune 500 president my experience includes blah blah blah
3322715 just stop ok when are you going to find out about me how can you ever help me if you dont stop telling me how great you are i could never work with someone like you
3322716 nu te las sati iei catel pentru ca o sa sara in piscina iar eu nu sunt dispus sa fac baie in apa cu aroma de caine
3322717 follow your bliss pursue your passion do what you love doing
3322718 what we do in the next two or three years will determine our future
3322719 the car park wasnt even full he could have parked anywhere

3322769 it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs it takes two weeks i recommend four intravenous injections 40 million stem cells or double that the more the better we also use human growth hormones but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list
3322770 i dont know how it was arranged or what level of hospital this was but it supports the idea that the world of athletics is very aware of gene doping and already pursuing it
3322771 there are interesting preliminary results but i cant expand on that
3322772 but were all encouraged by the results and wada very much wants to be ahead of the curve on this and has funded a dozen or more labs on gene doping
3322773 this is all very subjective but the hope is that it will be a fair process that will allow the athlete who has had gene therapy for legitimate reasons to state his or her purpose for it
3322774 the sporting authorities can then either accept or reject it
3322775 if gene doping is happening already as we suspect its being done unethically and with immature

3322786 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3322787 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3322788 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3322789 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3322790 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3322791 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about

3322819 theres no doubt about it we picked several from different parts of the planet took them aboard our recon vessels probed them all the way through theyre completely meat
3322820 thats impossible what about the radio signals the messages to the stars
3322821 they use the radio waves to talk but the signals dont come from them the signals come from machines
3322822 so who made the machines thats who we want to contact
3322823 they made the machines thats what im trying to tell you meat made the machines
3322824 thats ridiculous how can meat make a machine youre asking me to believe in sentient meat
3322825 im not asking you im telling you these creatures are the only sentient race in the sector and theyre made out of meat
3322826 maybe theyre like the orfolei you know a carbon based intelligence that goes through a meat stage
3322827 nope theyre born meat and they die meat we studied them for several of their life spans which didnt take too long do you have any idea the life span of meat
3322828 spare me okay maybe theyre only part meat you know like the weddilei a meat head with an electron plasma brain inside
3322829 nope we thought of that since they do have meat heads like the weddilei but i told you we probed them theyre meat all the way through
3322830 oh there is a brain all right its just that the brain is made out of meat
3322831 youre not understanding are you the brain does the thinking the meat
3322832 thinking meat youre asking me to believe in thinking meat
3322833 yes thinking meat conscious meat loving meat dreaming meat the meat is the whole deal are you getting the picture
3322834 finally yes they are indeed made out meat and theyve been trying to get in touch with us for almost a hundred of their years
3322835 first it wants to talk to us then i imagine it wants to explore the universe contact other sentients swap ideas and information the usual
3322836 thats the idea thats the message theyre sending out by radio hello anyone out there anyone home that sort of thing
3322837 they actually do talk then they use words ideas concepts
3322838 they do but what do you think is on the radio meat sounds you know how when you slap or flap meat it makes a noise they talk by flapping their meat at each other they can even sing by squirting air through their meat
3322839 omigod singing meat this is altogether too much so what do you advise
3322840 officially we are required to contact welcome and log in any and all sentient races or multibeings in the quadrant without prejudice fear or favor unofficially i advise that we erase the records and forget the whole thing
3322841 it seems harsh but there is a limit do we really want to make contact with meat
3322842 just one they can travel to other planets in special meat containers but they cant live on them and being meat they only travel through c space which limits them to the speed of light and makes the possibility of their ever making contact pretty slim infinitesimal in fact
3322843 so we just pretend theres no one home in the universe
3322844 cruel but you said it yourself who wants to meet meat and the ones who have been aboard our vessels the ones you have probed youre sure they wont remember
3322845 theyll be considered crackpots if they do we went into their heads and smoothed out their meat so that were just a dream to them
3322846 a dream to meat how strangely appropriate that we should be meats dream
3322847 good agreed officially and unofficially case closed any others anyone interesting on that side of the galaxy
3322848 yes a rather shy but sweet hydrogen core cluster intelligence in a class nine star in g445 zone was in contact two galactic rotations ago wants to be friendly again
3322849 and why not imagine how unbearably how unutterably cold the universe would be if one were all alone

3322895 the reintroduction of heritage brands in the automotive industry and the existence of several car enthusiast clubs dedicated to the rambler automobile

3322898 so that consumers would ascribe a single source to the products
3322899 in the present case we cannot ignore the fact that purchasers of opposers licensed goods or applicants automobile may be buying such goods because they know of the earlier rambler automobile and these purchasers would view both types of goods as originating from the same source namely the manufacturer of the old line of rambler automobiles

3322967 in keeping with surequests tradition of utilizing leading edge technology and remaining responsible to our clientele to ensure continuity we have chosen this time to announce that our threesquares product as well as all new software product releases will be available using the widely accepted on demand technology via the internet as well as in traditional installed software versions
3322968 surequest was an early adopter of the software as a service saas business model in 1993 we found our market highly receptive to renting software over the traditional practice of capitalizing the expense of both software and hardware this recurring revenue business model in place at surequest for over 15 years uniquely positions the company to take advantage of what has become widely known and accepted as software as a service advances in internet technology and the widespread availability of high speed bandwidth have made on demand delivery practical and highly desirable to our marketplace it is also a perfect match for our business model today surequest offers both software as a service and on demand delivery thus meeting the varied needs of all our customers while many software companies have chosen to transition exclusively to this saas business model we feel it is still important to give the customer a choice for example if a customer has invested in a large it infrastructure there may be a reluctance to switch immediately to an on demand solution and they may wish to stay with the more traditional software license and support structure with surequests unique design we can accommodate that customer today as well as tomorrow when the timing is right to transition to software as a service

3322973 when we implemented our it governance process we were actively working on 20 projects and we identified 60 additional projects that our three business units wanted us to accomplish so we needed to establish an effective prioritization process
3322974 with the innotas on demand ppm solution as a core of our it governance process we have complete visibility into all of our active and potential projects and we can easily prioritize them and focus on the projects that add the most value to the business

3323122 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3323123 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3323124 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3323125 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3323126 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3323127 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3323128 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3323129 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3323130 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3323131 since focused on his environmental crusade winning an oscar for his documentary an inconvenient truth as well as the 2007 nobel peace prize on thursday he proposed a bol
3323132 theyd recommend just going in and having another drink in the morning thats sort of what that reminds me of
3323133 wir k nnen es nicht jedem recht machen wenn wir das versuchen w rden w rde die rakete nie starten
3323134 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3323135 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3323136 i think we need to think beyond the square by having an institution that facilitates that sort of cooperation across the policy spaces rather than one specifically constrained to economic mandate
3323137 in developing this discussion lets be clear what an asia pacific community is not
3323138 it is not an economic union it is not a monetary union it is not at this stage even a customs union it is a concept and it is certainly not a political union
3323139 a sudden feeling of fear or anxiety that comes on suddenly is overwhelming appears to be uncontrollable and may seem to be unfounded
3323140 historically presidential nominations were decided at the party conventions and as a result the vice presidential running mates were also selected at the conventions gallups jeff jones notes
3323141 that made it difficult to disentangle the effect of naming a vice presidential running mate on a candidates support from the
3323142 the small window of time after the announcement of a presidential candidates running mate but before the convention has taken place
3323143 similar to the pattern seen with clinton in 1996 support for gore held steady during bushs vice presidential selection phase at 41 percent
3323144 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3323145 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3323146 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3323147 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3323148 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3323149 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3323150 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3323151 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3323152 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3323153 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3323154 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3323155 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3323156 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
3323157 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3323158 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3323159 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3323160 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3323161 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3323162 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3323163 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3323164 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3323165 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3323166 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3323167 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3323168 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3323169 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3323170 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3323171 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3323172 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3323173 no you cannot defend yourself and no we cannot be held criminally liable for taking five minutes to get to you as youre being beaten bound and raped by two thugs twice your size and high on something have a nice day

3323176 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3323177 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3323178 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3323179 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3323180 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3323181 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3323182 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3323183 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3323184 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3323185 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3323186 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
3323187 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
3323188 falling inflation suggests that the governments macro tightening measures have been effective which will both reduce investor fears of the possibility of policy missteps and increase the chances of a shift to targeted pro growth policies
3323189 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3323190 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3323191 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3323192 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3323193 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3323194 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3323195 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3323196 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3323197 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3323198 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom

3323202 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3323203 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3323204 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3323205 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3323206 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3323207 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3323208 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3323209 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3323210 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3323211 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3323212 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3323213 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3323214 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3323215 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3323216 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3323217 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3323218 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3323219 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3323220 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3323221 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3323222 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
3323223 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3323224 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3323225 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3323226 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3323227 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3323228 just so you all know we did set a record
3323229 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3323230 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3323231 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3323232 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3323233 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3323234 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3323235 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3323236 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3323237 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3323238 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3323239 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3323240 enable a czech student to browse the british library without going to london or an irish art lover to get close to the mona lisa without queuing at the louvre
3323241 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3323242 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3323243 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3323244 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3323245 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3323246 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3323247 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3323248 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3323249 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3323250 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3323251 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3323252 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3323253 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3323254 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3323255 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3323256 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3323257 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3323258 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3323259 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3323260 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3323261 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3323262 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3323263 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3323264 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3323265 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3323266 empire of debt the rise of an epic financial crisis
3323267 the honest truth is that we have too many people in washington living for today rather than saving for tomorrow
3323268 give americans a good talking to about the countrys sloppy debt habits
3323269 the american people are a lot smarter than people give them credit for
3323270 comment by bruce in miami august 8 2008 at 9 54 am
3323271 if a wall streeter is selling you dont want to be buying end of story
3323272 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
3323273 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
3323274 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3323275 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
3323276 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
3323277 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3323278 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3323279 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3323280 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3323281 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3323282 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3323283 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3323284 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3323285 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3323286 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3323287 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3323288 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3323289 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3323290 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3323291 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3323292 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3323293 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3323294 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3323295 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3323296 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3323297 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3323298 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3323299 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3323300 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3323301 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3323302 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3323303 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3323304 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3323305 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3323306 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
3323307 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
3323308 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
3323309 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
3323310 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
3323311 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
3323312 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
3323313 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
3323314 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
3323315 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
3323316 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
3323317 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3323318 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3323319 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3323320 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3323321 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3323322 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3323323 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3323324 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3323325 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3323326 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3323327 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3323328 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3323329 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3323330 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3323331 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3323332 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3323333 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3323334 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3323335 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
3323336 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
3323337 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
3323338 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3323339 this isnt just a career for me its my passion
3323340 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
3323341 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
3323342 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3323343 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3323344 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3323345 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3323346 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3323347 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
3323348 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
3323349 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
3323350 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3323351 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3323352 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3323353 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3323354 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3323355 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
3323356 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
3323357 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3323358 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3323359 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3323360 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3323361 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3323362 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3323363 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3323364 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3323365 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3323366 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3323367 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3323368 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3323369 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3323370 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3323371 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3323372 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3323373 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3323374 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3323375 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3323376 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3323377 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3323378 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3323379 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3323380 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
3323381 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
3323382 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
3323383 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
3323384 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
3323385 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
3323386 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
3323387 los rusos detuvieron su avance no hay movimientos de fuerzas rusas pero las mismas permanecen en las posiciones que ocupan
3323388 el acuerdo del cese del fuego a n se debe firmar la declaraci n del presidente ruso dmitri medvedev puede significar esperamos que ya no nos disparar n m s
3323389 the only problem was the bed was so high i nearly fell off and broke my neck at different stages
3323390 rebecca and i first made love the night after the night i left the big brother house and it was amazing
3323391 we simply couldnt on my eviction night because we needed to talk first and there was too much going on
3323392 but by saturday at around 11pm after a long day we crawled into bed and just started kissing
3323393 we looked into each others eyes and knew it was the right time without saying a word we knew what was going to happen it was inevitable
3323394 the setting was perfect the lights were dim and rebecca and i have never known such luxury although it would have been nice to have some atmosphere and no im not talking about kat or darnell singing
3323395 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3323396 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3323397 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3323398 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3323399 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3323400 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3323401 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3323402 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3323403 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3323404 the special permit process protects citizens from tyranny of the majority
3323405 it has a process it can be amended with a public hearing and notice to abutters a memorandum of understanding with selectmen is not a public process how will it be amended
3323406 its a search engine if you dont want people looking at your photos dont post them on the web
3323407 why are we in government are we here to protect the well endowed is it our job to make the rich richer were not going to lose much or gain much and maybe its worth it to see some stud like myself walking down the street but its not worth it mr speaker maybe theyre pretty or handsome and tall but they dont need our money its the people in our districts who need our help they blow in one week and blow out the next week i dont know how many hamburgers they eat when theyre here but it aint than much i hope the bill doesnt pass and im going to come back for an encore again because people have told me i might have a shot at this hollywood myself
3323408 firm of the year by the american institute of architects the highest award to a collaborative practice

3323410 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3323411 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3323412 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3323413 most of the time these antibodies dont do much so we thought it would be useful if we could teach them to recognise hiv
3323414 the antibodies block the interaction between virus and host cell recruit molecules that will destroy infected cells and alert killer cells that will eat them
3323415 this is really amazing our detector actually flew to the edge of outer space and then back to ground and the whole time it worked perfectly
3323416 the best part about the project is that the detector was built from everyday materials and launched into near space from right here in our own backyard
3323417 this proves you can accomplish really amazing things with simple materials
3323418 the presence of the third alternative shifts the focus of the customer if you have two automobiles extolling their fuel efficiency while a third promotes style purchasers pay more attention to the fuel efficiency criterion then when one of the high fuel efficiency cars leaves the market the other fuel efficient car draws consumers in the case of automobiles it might be fuel efficiency and in the case of political candidates it might be health care when the third choice exits the remaining candidate with the most similar attributes becomes the favourite even if they werent before
3323419 we also call this effect the phantom decoy effect because like pre announced software that is never released these desirable options that become unavailable may never actually exist
3323420 you cannot ask a rahul dravid sachin tendulkar sourav ganguly vvs laxman or anil kumble to prove their credentials
3323421 i think you should ask the selectors and the bcci this question i am happy with whatever they have in mind
3323422 i think it is just with time we should start winning in odis consistently we are a great team and we start doing well pretty soon australia as a team is still far ahead yes we can beat australia and we have proved that but to do it consistently we have to improve a lot i think once we become more consistent we can think of being number one
3323423 everyone has to improve we have got good bowlers in the side and they are doing their best
3323424 not at all a player can be good in odis and tests and 20 20 as well look at virender sehwag or gautam gambhir
3323425 well i am a person who goes and thinks by my heart i do whatever my heart tells me to do i am not sure what man management is the team is like my own family i treat them the way a person will treat his own family i think my team members were obviously there behind me other than that my family and friends are always behind me
3323426 i will play the way the team requires me to play and i will come onto bat whenever the team requires me to do so it is not an experiment
3323427 there is irfan pathan who is doing quite well i am sure players like praveen kumar piyush chawla and others will come off age virender sehwag is bowling really well
3323428 we have a good 11 and our bench strength is also not that bad in fact we have to leave out world class bowlers like r p singh or piyush chawla from a team also batsmen like robin uthappa manoj tiwary does not find a place in the 11 this certainly shows that we have a good amount of support players
3323429 i feel we should play according to our strengths neither has australia or england or south africa changed their pitches for us so i dont see any reason why should we change our pitches
3323430 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3323431 the tuesday night meeting will give the board a base of community concerns and support for the project at waverly oaks
3323432 people have basically been deferring to starting projects until the fall
3323433 no one wants to get into production on a major motion picture when theres the possibility of a strike
3323434 we had a very busy spring and now theyre taking a wait and see attitude
3323435 certainly when youre trying to grow an industry that doesnt help anyone
3323436 we need to keep up investing in university systems for training and with internships
3323437 we are a major production center we have all the major infrastructure we have the crew base the actors and you get new york under the circumstances you dont have to match dollar for dollar what other regions may do
3323438 it gets to the point that youve got to be careful what youre doing
3323439 whats based in new york will stay in new york
3323440 connecticut has interesting geography architecture and all sorts of things that will draw people to make films
3323441 the copyright measures adopted today should underline that we take a holistic approach when it comes to intellectual property the proposal on term extension has a strong social component and the green paper is deeply embedded in the overall societal and knowledge context
3323442 i am committed to concentrate all necessary efforts to ensure that performers have a decent income and that there will be a european based music industry in the years to come
3323443 really if they were planning something like this anywhere on the east coast i would be excited but the fact that they might be building it around the corner from my house i couldnt have imagined it
3323444 to have hollywood interested in your hometown theres this sense of pride you have
3323445 id work with costumes or set design or anything really
3323446 i would love to have my own show but ill start at the bottom ill be the water girl and work my way up thats the way the business works and i know that
3323447 which would be incredibly interesting and beats driving to waltham
3323448 well just come over here and ill talk really quiet
3323449 the branding of boston and massachusetts is starting to evolve as more than just a history based location its now also a hollywood and celebrity based location
3323450 as they make more movies we have more stuff to talk about
3323451 and i think what were doing kind of goes hand in hand with that it makes this whole idea of this filming movement thats coming to boston of this hollywood east seem a little more permanent
3323452 it puts the burden on the copyright owner to find the offending parties and either negotiate with them without the remedies currently available to bring about reasonable compensation or bring costly litigation in short for copyright owners the orphan works bill is a disaster
3323453 the original premise of this legislation was to protect libraries museums and other not for profit users in efforts to digitize archives of materials for which owners could not be located however as drafted the legislation goes much further it applies to any use of a copyrighted work in short it creates an incentive to steal first and pay later if caught policing infringing uses on the internet is already difficult this raises the bar and places the burden on copyright owners to locate infringers of their works at the same time threatening to wipe out 100 years of legal protection under u s law
3323454 the internet computer and consumer electronics industries utilize vast amounts of copyrighted works to attract customers to their websites from which they derive enormous profits from advertising and subscription fees these industries have long sought to eliminate copyright protection and to avoid paying for the content they use to lure consumers at the same time companies such as google and other computer related interests have provided more than million dollars to the library of congress of which the u s copyright office which initiated the orphan works legislation is a part
3323455 i dont think theres another bill that can come through here
3323456 its a blow to the industry we shoot movies here but we dont make them
3323457 im glad to hear youre concerned about copyright issues as i am too
3323458 scenario one if a copyright owner has registered his copyright he can get statutory damages and attorneys fees
3323459 scenario two if a copyright owner has not registered his copyright he can only get actual damages
3323460 under the orphan works legislation all infringement scenarios are as a practical matter scenario two
3323461 the enjoyment and the exercise of these rights shall not be subject to any formality emphasis added
3323462 hey look im on zeldman com and at the bottom it says that l jeffrey zeldman owns the copyright
3323463 hey look im on a sleazy link farm site that stole an article written by jonathan snook and removed jonathans name and copyright information from the article i dont know the article is stolen or at least i can plausibly claim not to know i dont know the site is a sleazy link farm site or at least i can plausibly claim not to know the design of the site leads me to believe the site is professional the design is stolen but i dont necessarily know that well theres no authors name on this article and no copyright information i think ill use this article on our companys marketing site since it fits right into our area of specialization
3323464 hey look im on a sleazy link farm site that stole an article written by jonathan snook and removed jonathans name and copyright information from the article and posted it under creative commons
3323465 if the legal or beneficial owner of the exclusive right under the infringed copyright proves and the court finds that the infringer has earned proceeds directly attributable to the infringement the portion of such proceeds so attributable may be awarded to such owner
3323466 there are 600 000 college students here in the commonwealth
3323467 we want to start bringing together the young creative minds of the community as well as provide a distribution solution for their talents
3323468 the prospect of having our very own hollywood of the east coast is a dream come true for me
3323469 i love this area who wants to move to la anyway
3323470 if people dont get enough power to it enough lumens enough punch enough wattage then it just becomes like a flashlight thats been stuck on the lawn
3323471 they just dont have enough output to make them really viable for lighting a large area
3323472 youre going to get the greatest amount of light from that fixture being outside in the dark with the foliage youre going to need something thats really going to project light
3323473 if people have definite plants trees with good branch structure they may want to highlight those
3323474 always make sure you have enough slack and extra wire to move things around a little bit dont be overanxious to bury the cable right away until youre happy with it
3323475 i am committed to concentrate all necessary efforts to ensure that performers have a decent income and that there will be a european based music industry in the years to come

3323477 if massachusetts can support a studio in weymouth and in plymouth why not have it the bigger we make these projects the better it is for the economy

3323482 promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries
3323483 if they got a 20 percent tax credit to cover its infrastructure construction costs it would amount to a 60 million tax credit altogether
3323484 the cap is based on what international studio spends each year to build the studios if they want to double the size of the project to 600 million they will have an incentive this tax credit is not unlike what we have done for manufacturing companies
3323485 the ultimate goal of international studio is to build 10 studios
3323486 they want to surround the studios with buildings to house technicians post production staff and computer specialists they want to be able to film movies outdoors in boston or elsewhere in the state and be able to their post editing work or animation in weymouth
3323487 we want to help create an industry here i want movie producers to think of massachusetts as a place where they can shoot outdoor scenes in boston and go to weymouth or plymouth to finish the production we already have a film tax credit in this state that works we have increased the amount of movies that have been filmed in boston
3323488 there are two or three movies being filmed right now in the state

3323512 no question that if the economy goes into recession or is already in it unemployment and job security are going to get worse

3323526 the integration of infrastructure and food tracing solutions is complex and challenging
3323527 ibm was one of the key players involved in creating the epcis standards upon which the success of this project relies
3323528 we are therefore confident that ibm has the right technology and expertise for this project consumers are becoming increasingly aware of food quality safety origin and traceability this creates greater pressure on manufacturers to keep track of every component in the manufacturing process in order to ensure that their products are safe for the consumer ibm and matiq are developing solutions that will help ensure food safety on the consumers terms

3323532 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
3323533 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
3323534 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
3323535 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
3323536 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
3323537 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

3323547 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
3323548 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
3323549 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american

3323554 his repeated assertions that obama would rather lose a war than lose an election make mccain look like some sort of archie bunker throwback only we knew that archie was a sitcom character not a candidate for president of the united states can you imagine if he were to carry this bilious behavior to the international arena leading by testy insinuation pretty scary stuff considering the memory lapses coupled with his computer illiteracy in the age of global media does john mccain even grasp the significance of his deficiency in 21st century skills

3323558 georgia a nation of about 4 6 million has had the third largest military presence about 2 000 troops fighting along with u s soldiers and marines in iraq for this reason alone we owe georgia a serious effort to defend its sovereignty surely we cannot simply stand by as an autocratic aggressor gobbles up part of and perhaps destabilizes all of a friendly democratic nation that we were sponsoring for nato membership a few months ago
3323559 the verdict was guilty of providing material support rather like we used to do for oh osama bin laden when he was fighting the commies and saddam hussein when he was fighting iran and not guilty of downright being a terrorist
3323560 theres an old saying that i recall from my childhood you and what army the simple fact of the matter is that short of displaying a willingness to use nuclear weapons russia simply lacks the manpower and resources to expand its borders by force note that even right now they are not invading georgia proper just the provinces in dispute its also worth pointing out that short of displaying a willingness to use nuclear weapons or engage in large scale bombing of civilian populations theres not much that the united states could do right now to intervene in the situation in georgia to any significant extent
3323561 mobbing im vorschul und fr hen grundschulalter ist ein nahezu unerforschtes thema in deutschland
3323562 dabei berichten kinderg rtnerinnen und auch kinder rzte dass kinder erste mobbing erfahrungen schon ab dem alter von vier bis sechs jahren machen
3323563 bis zum jahr 2020 gilt es die immense potenzielle wertsch pfung in der deutschen bau und immobilienwirtschaft zu nutzen die tragende s ule im wirtschaftssystem deutschland fortzuentwickeln sowie einen nachhaltigen export in unsere globalisierte welt zu erreichen
3323564 unsere europ ischen niederlassungen beteiligen sich an dieser gro artigen initiative und unterst tzen so das team joachim franz dabei das thema hiv aids im bewusstsein der menschen zu halten
3323565 wir sind ein langj hriger partner des teams und haben auch fr here aktionen gesponsert wie die 23 000 kilometer lange panamerika mountainbike expedition und die aids awareness tour durch deutschland im jahr 2007 zu der wir gemeinsam mit unseren partnern mehr als 15 000 euro beisteuern konnten
3323566 wir freuen uns dass wir acht so namhafte kunden f r die gr te europ ische kundenerprobung gewinnen konnten london hat seit jahren eine sehr hohe verkehrsdichte und damit auch erh hte emissionen mit unserem fuso canter eco hybrid lkw wollen wir beweisen dass transportleistungen im stadtverkehr noch umweltfreundlicher sein k nnen
3323567 mitsubishi fuso bietet den fuso canter eco hybrid bereits seit 2006 in japan an und st t damit auf immer gr eres interesse auch bei den kunden in europa
3323568 allerdings sind die noch relativ hohen hybridkosten f r viele kunden ein hindernis bei der anschaffung daimler investiert gemeinsam mit den versuchspartnern in dieses pilotprojekt um herauszufinden wie wirtschaftlich der hybrid im vergleich zu konventionellen antrieben f r den kunden ist und um die produktentwicklung im hinblick auf die kundenanforderungen zu optimieren
3323569 mein team hat mir angezeigt dass der zweite platz reicht also habe ich es in den letzten runden etwas langsamer angehen lassen und den titel sicher nach hause gefahren
3323570 die preissteigerung ist sicher schmerzhaft aber wir haben es geschafft weit unter den zur zeit allgemein angek ndigten preissteigerungen in der branche zu bleiben selbst den letzten tarifabschluss in h he von 5 1 prozent haben wir durch kosteneinsparungen aufgefangen ob dies in der zukunft weiter gelingt kann man zum jetzigen zeitpunkt nicht prognostizieren
3323571 r ckblickend auf die letzten jahre haben sich unsere preisanpassungen immer an unseren bezugskosten orientiert das hat in 2007 zu einer gaspreissenkung von rund 10 prozent gef hrt leider kam nicht alles auf grund der gleichzeitige erh hung der mehrwertsteuer bei unseren kunden an
3323572 energie ist eines der schl sselthemen des 21 jahrhunderts und ganz egal ob wir sonne oder l steinkohle wasser oder wind nutzen werden die fragen nach verf gbarkeit effizienz und preis immer dr ngender
3323573 wir bem hen uns kosten zu senken und unsere bezugskosten zu optimieren so beteiligen wir uns mit drei weiteren partnern an der errichtung eines salzstocks im m nsterl ndischen epe mit einer speicherkapazit t von etwa 180 millionen kubikmeter arbeitsgas dies entspricht rund zwei milliarden kilowattstunden erdgas

3323587 on a street circuit the problem is that theres no grip in the beginning
3323588 on a normal track you learn it in ten laps but it will take more than that maybe 20 to get the hang of valencia
3323589 well really be taking a guess on the set up from what we know of other street tracks and then take it step by step through the weekend so its very important to keep the car on the track because if you crash you lose a lot of time that the others will spend working on it
3323590 all the teams are starting at zero so it will be a big challenge for everyone to get the best out of it as quickly as possible in the limited time we have
3323591 its not like a normal street track it seems wide like an american type of street circuit

3323608 taken as a whole the federal tax system is progressive on average households with higher incomes pay a larger share of their income in federal tax than do those with lower incomes in other words the overall average effective tax rate total tax paid as a percentage of income rises as income rises but not all taxes within the federal system are equally progressive the estate tax is the most progressive federal tax the individual and corporate income taxes are also progressive in contrast payroll taxes for social security and medicare are regressive claiming a larger share of income from lower income than from higher income households for 2008 average effective payroll tax rates are estimated at 8 4 percent for the bottom fifth of income earners and 10 4 percent for the next fifth but only 5 7 percent for the top fifth households in the top 1 percent will pay an estimated average of only 1 5 percent of their income in payroll taxes this regressivity of payroll taxes stems from two factors first the social security portion of payroll taxes is subject to a cap in 2008 individuals pay social security tax on only their first 102 000 in earnings second higher income households tend to receive more of their income from sources other than wages such as capital gains and dividends which are not subject to the payroll tax
3323609 you can see it in their eyes that they dont know quite what to expect
3323610 there is a combination of wanting to do well for themselves not wanting to let their teammates down and making sure they can still play football after all this time away from the field
3323611 for some of the older guys it is the better part of a few decades since they last threw a football or receiving instruction from coaches and then there is an element of the intimidation factor the penn state players they have cheered from the stands for years and the coaches whose game plan they have admired are now in the locker room talking xs and os with them it can be a surreal experience
3323612 weve been in the end zone before and can help them
3323613 we become one big family pretty quickly and the new guys will be welcomed into that fraternity some people might appear a bit nervous even us experienced guys but that will soon disappear once the first practice is underway
3323614 they wouldnt be here if they didnt have a passion for penn state and a burning desire to learn what makes this famous organization tick
3323615 they get to see penn state from the inside which is a very unique and privileged perspective
3323616 they were truly drained and had nothing left in the tank
3323617 although they were exhausted i know they would have played and played until there was a winner but this was the ideal ending
3323618 it didnt quite match the 100 000 or so who were on hand when many of these players enjoyed watching a penn state game after the fantasy bowl last year but it was special in other ways
3323619 the game itself was a classic battle and it was fitting that nobody ended up on the losing team because everyone fought their hearts out
3323620 it appears as though it was quite a vicious attack
3323621 the word on the street is that someone has been shot and a hammer has been used
3323622 the importance of aircraft seating as a revenue driver can only increase in the future design which delivers advantages for the carrier in terms of weight reduction and maintenance costs and which provides a unique experience for the traveller will be the key to success
3323623 my son and i are really looking forward to the camp
3323624 i did have lofty dreams of losing 10 to 15 pounds before camp but that never happened
3323625 so i hope everyone will not be too hard on an old timer it should be great just getting to see how psu football works from the inside
3323626 one of the great things about the fantasy football camp that is breathless to watch is how involved the campers families are
3323627 to see the eye of the kids when the dad runs out the tunnel for the first time it is really special
3323628 the game and camp is great but the life relationship and friendships that develop are priceless it is just a game but the passion for the game is special i love it

3323640 we have asked geoff to join us in australia and new zealand when we present to stakeholders including player groups the result of the task team visit
3323641 as a former australia test player a coach and someone who lives in pakistan he is in a unique position to give his perspective to those stakeholders
3323642 he had differences with the selectors over the selection of some players and was not happy with the situation
3323643 all the news papers were expected to adopt to the style of the newspaper
3323644 so far we have got from them moral support and humanitarian aid but we need more than that to stop this barbaric aggression
3323645 democracy is stronger than any of their bombs any of their tanks
3323646 it now appears that an effort may be underway to depose georgias duly elected government
3323647 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3323648 these actions would be inconsistent with assurances we have received from russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo in south ossetia that existed before fighting began on aug 6
3323649 these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world
3323650 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

3323931 my understanding is that jordan wrote a really great script but then he was asked to do revisions and then there was the writers strike
3323932 i know theyve done another rewrite since and i couldnt tell you whether it was jordan who did it or someone else but that one continues to be developed

3323947 this is an extremely rare case of co infection in a controlled monogamous relationship which showed us how a strong immune system in the elite suppressor kept the virus from replicating and infecting other cells
3323948 our findings offer hope to vaccine researchers because they reveal that the immune systems primary offense known as cd8 killer t cells can effectively halt disease progression by a pathogenic form of hiv
3323949 moreover the strength of the immune response was not dependent on infection by a weakened form of the virus and if we can harness the means by which these elite white blood cells stop the virus then we can hopefully teach or reprogram white blood cells in others to also target hiv
3323950 the presence of this genetic spot is a discordant result that strongly contradicts theories that various genetic factors alone play a protective role in suppression
3323951 elite suppression offers clues to vaccine researchers on many fronts how cd8 killer t cells can attack hiv and how a stronger immune response can force hiv into a permanent defensive state

3323971 there continues to be reluctance on the part of both patients and treating physicians to accept the toxicity of platinum based therapy given the associated small gain in survival so active therapies with improved toxicity profiles are clearly needed
3323972 this is a promising alternative but needs further testing in randomized trials
3323973 our study shows that early weight loss can reduce the risk factors that so often lead to diabetes complications and death
3323974 weve known for a long time that weight loss is an important component in diabetes treatment and prevention now it appears there may be a critical window of opportunity following diagnosis in which some lasting gains can be achieved if people are willing to take immediate steps toward lifestyle changes
3323975 we dont know if the initial weight loss increased the bodys sensitivity to insulin or if the sustained lifestyle changes were the reason for the long term health benefits
3323976 but we do know that losing weight reduces the risk factors that often lead to heart disease blindness nerve and kidney damage amputations and death in type 2 diabetes patients

3323980 bland food con sisting of mashed potatoes chicken and spinach gar nished with liver powder
3323981 we were unable to identify any peer reviewed research which supports the interventions used at the judge rotenberg center
3323982 these students engage in behaviors such as head banging eye gouging and biting off body parts
3323983 jrcs policy is to use a highly consistent application of behavior modification treatment and mini mal or no psychotropic medication
3323984 we have been stymied by the house and its incredibly frustrating
3323985 immediate risk of serious physical injury or harm to self or others
3323986 the government has a fundamental duty to protect vulnerable populations
3323987 and the commonwealth of massachusetts has a moral imperative to address this issue once and for all
3323988 we dont allow this sort of treatment on our prison ers
3323989 establish a network of associated experimental communities in cities throughout the world
3323990 when that threat is removed they revert to their original behaviors
3323991 israel couldnt stand them not behaving in a perfectly controlled way
3323992 i stood there for eight hours a day and basically watched their behaviors and marked it in their behavior logs
3323993 theres a lack of dedication to education and its across the board
3323994 all of these behaviors had to be consequated with a ged electric shock
3323995 there were no exceptions a scream was a scream a grab was a grab and we had to follow court approved orders
3323996 staff would get evaluated and might even lose their jobs
3323997 the first staffer said that the caller told him that there had been behaviors before the overnight shift that needed consequences
3323998 delivered ged consequences to al v the student while he was in bed
3323999 the student says that he got three geds for nothing
3324000 the student is seen speaking to the second staffer saying get on the phone and find out what is going on they have to call my clinician
3324001 yall can give me some when you get these out of my cold dead fingers
3324002 the first of the rec room geds is given without a pinpoint for the behavior
3324003 a 9th ged was given and on the audio of the dvr footage an audible sob is heard but it does not appear to be from the student
3324004 he left because he thought he would either cry or throw up if he stayed
3324005 18 was given for swearing 19 was given with the accompanying pinpoint no refusing to follow staff directions the student responded to this with yes sir 20 was given with no pinpoint 21 again for refusing to follow direction
3324006 the 37th was given for attempting to remove device as were the 38th and 39th geds 50 51 52 and 53 were given for verbal threats to destroy
3324007 if we tried to apply this brutal device to a prisoner in guantanamo or someone in abu ghraib there would be worldwide outrage
3324008 in fact its against the eighth amendment in our country right cruel and unusual punishment but we allow it for these innocent children its just not right
3324009 would be among the most meaningful things ive ever been involved with
3324010 if you dont increase the dose were not going to keep him here
3324011 youre talking about chopping down some trees to generate this paper
3324012 it bothers me terribly but if you asked me whether i would rather him be shocked for a short period of time or beat himself up or bite himself severely or slice himself up with a razor blade the answer is simple
3324013 we want whats best for our son not whats best for jrc
3324014 saying hes going to shove it in my bleep bleep bleep

3324018 he said that it was like going into the marines if he had the ged he knew that he would stop behaving badly
3324019 if it were not for this program my son would be dead and if it werent for that i would blow his freakin brains out thats what i would do for my son
3324020 mommy you dont love me anymore cause you let them hurt me so bad
3324021 when you first hear about a school that uses skin shock its shocking if you dont understand the severity of the mutilation that the students would otherwise en gage in
3324022 there are a small num ber of people who have very severe and frequently multiple problems where other treatments have proven to be in effective for this small number what the judge rotenberg center has done has proven to be effective
3324023 we dont do this to prisoners in the criminal justice system so we shouldnt be doing it to people with dis abilities
3324024 it feels like you stick your finger in an electric socket for two seconds and the tingling didnt stop right away
3324025 i was advised that the shock felt like a small pinch
3324026 the market is dropping heavily these days because of deeper worries about an economic slowdown

3324046 do some simple calculation how many shows we would have ended up getting eventually if we had arrived on 22nd august singh is kinng was meant to open huge and its effect would well continue into the third week as well then both god tussi great ho are big too which would have meant that exhibitors would have kept good number of shows of these two films as well
3324047 now imagine 6 movies coming just a week after even if you are the preferred film for a multiplex in a particular week you would still have ended up with 2 3 4 shows only due to sheer volume of films isse achcha toh 1 week baad aaye at least we would end up getting good number of shows for ourselves since by that time the euphoria of the earlier released films would have subsided to a great extent
3324048 there is no evidence to support claims that uk migrants gain access to social housing in preference to uk nationals
3324049 this is backed up by recent findings of the independent equality and human rights commission and local government association review into social housing from april this year
3324050 nonetheless we recognise that there is a perception that migrants sometimes receive preferential treatment
3324051 the green paper on housing reform we will publish later this year will look at how we can improve transparency in the housing allocations process and ensure that it is not only fair but seen to be fair
3324052 its no wonder more people feel there is an increase in racism when labours multicultural industry is forever talking up what divides us rather than concentrating on what unites us
3324053 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3324054 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3324055 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3324056 with large projects in rail roads electricity water and sewerage all scheduled over the next two years the civil engineering sector seems well placed to ride out the current economic downturn
3324057 however the industry is facing the possibility of a serious threat caused by a combination of rising costs and the economic downturn that could result in delays and at worst cancellation of some of these schemes
3324058 these homes are genuinely ground breaking in their use of eco technology ultimately that means the homes will require less fuel for heating and lighting and with fuel prices rising so rapidly minimising bills for our residents is a top priority
3324059 the plans are the result of a strong partnership with the council to ensure the homes fully meet the needs of the local community and we are delighted to get the go ahead to start building we would like to thank both the council and the housing corporation for their support
3324060 the council is very pleased to be working with lha asra on this innovative scheme
3324061 it will provide much needed housing for older people that is cheap and easy to run comfortable and accessible

3324065 i was the only black model there one of the people running the casting said to my agent that i looked like a monkey
3324066 there is even less opportunity if you are a young black girl
3324067 people at the agencies still categorise me as a black model i am a model not a black model

3324072 i have never seen her so angry she hit the roof and said she planned to sue she allows her accessories to be lent to shoots all the time but she would never ever allow anything of hers to go to a fashion house that deals exclusively with fur

3324074 she didnt see any proofs she just saw the campaign its a monumental cock up stella is disgusted

3324080 hey girl just making sure were still on for this morning
3324081 you know how in recovery sometimes things move so slowly you wonder if anything is happening and other times they move at the speed of light
3324082 im in the speed of light stage again right now
3324083 its so amazing but its blowing my mind its going too fast for me to figure it out and let it sink in
3324084 i have this need to gain a better understanding of the steps and try to do better with the whole thing all while learning from my co worker and how to just be there for him and losing the desire to control him
3324085 at some point you will need to redefine what your abstinence means to you that changes a lot as well
3324086 dammit i have to go i left my work stuff at home and have to get it
3324087 ok one more thing i need you to try and get to at least two meetings a week and try al anon if you can to help with dealing with your co worker
3324088 has a dreamy feel with an alternative vibe which has a section that could be described as an alien contact
3324089 is another highlight with a very good intro which doubles as the staple of the song
3324090 follows and continues the main riff but with a different feel to the track which can be felt as soon as it starts
3324091 has an alternative ambient chill out style like floating in air at zero gravity
3324092 is a track that could be seen as the commercial song that some big alternative act like radiohead could steal for their own use
3324093 does take a while to get going as if you are at the farthest end of the solar system trying to contact anyone
3324094 which is the shortest track on the album but dont worry about it stopping after 35 seconds because you get a nice piano solo like sitting with a glass of wine looking in the sky
3324095 oh if you are available i presume your partner is too can i contact him is he available too
3324096 who the fu you think you are to judge me why you are presuming im here for slex why you are supposing im cheating my partner what the hell you know about my relationship

3324107 what i really want traditional republicans the kind of people who enthusiastically supported ronald reagan to understand is that mccains election will be worse for them and worse for the nation in the long run than a victory by obama

3324143 my only fear at this point is that by pointing this out we may goad the bushies and neocons into finding some kind of military escalation that would bring in the us
3324144 this highlights i think some of the limits of the kind of bluff and bluster approach to foreign policy that seems popular among conservatives these days

3324154 for the first time we can predict the strength of the 11 year solar activity cycle using computer simulations of the suns physics
3324155 this prediction of an active solar cycle suggests we are potentially looking at more communication and navigation disruptions more satellite failures possible disruption of electric grids and blackouts more dangerous conditions for astronauts all these things
3324156 the kinds of questions that are posed to hurricane forecasters also come to us in terms of space weather
3324157 when is the next cycle going to start how strong will it be when will it quiet down and compared to say the last cycle in recent memory what are the effects going to be
3324158 at this point we are anxiously awaiting the appearance of those first spots from the new cycle
3324159 this is one of the major mysteries in solar physics
3324160 the dynamo is a process by which the mechanical motions on and in the sun are converted into magnetic energy
3324161 the cyclical nature of the sunspot cycle is strong evidence that the magnetic field within the sun is being regenerated during this cycle
3324162 some details of the migration pattern as observed in spot behavior is beyond the current capability of dynamo models to produce but it may be possible with more elaborate models now under development
3324163 in fact in a very recent work we are predicting the onset of the next cycle cycle 24 will be late because the meridional flow slowed down in the current cycle
3324164 the plasma blob that was ejected from the sun hit the earth
3324165 the blob came at exceptionally high speeds it took only 17 hours and 40 minutes to go from the sun to earth
3324166 the magnetic fields in the blob called a coronal mass ejection were exceptionally intense
3324167 and the fourth most important ingredient was that the magnetic fields of the blob were opposite in direction from the earths fields
3324168 it could very well be even more intense than what transpired in 1859
3324169 a monster event of the magnitude described by tsurutani we would easily recognize as something extraordinary with soho and other solar instruments
3324170 such a strong white light flare has never been seen since
3324171 so if this type of flare happened yes we would know right away
3324172 in 1859 the technology was quite low in comparison to todays technology
3324173 however the technology that we rely on today is much more vulnerable
3324174 so one might expect much worse problems if it occurred today
3324175 this can lead to enhanced satellite drag and possible loss of these to the atmosphere
3324176 hey you said the sun does not get wider but i can see with my own eyes that it is much larger overall at sunset than at midday
3324177 yes the setting sun suffers the same illusion as the rising moon
3324178 the next sunspot cycle will be 30 to 50 percent stronger than the last one
3324179 i look at telescopic images of the sun almost every day thinking it could be today
3324180 its based on sound physical principles and it finally answers the 150 year old question what causes the sunspot cycle
3324181 the next sunspot cycle will be 30 to 50 stronger than the previous one
3324182 first remember what sunspots are tangled knots of magnetism generated by the suns inner dynamo a typical sunspot exists for just a few weeks then it decays leaving behind a corpse of weak magnetic fields
3324183 the top of the conveyor belt skims the surface of the sun sweeping up the magnetic fields of old dead sunspots the corpses are dragged down at the poles to a depth of 200 000 km where the suns magnetic dynamo can amplify them once the corpses magnetic knots are reincarnated amplified they become buoyant and float back to the surface
3324184 it takes about 40 years for the belt to complete one loop
3324185 anywhere from a 50 year pace slow to a 30 year pace fast
3324186 old magnetic fields swept up then should re appear as big sunspots in 2010 2011
3324187 history shows that big sunspot cycles ramp up faster than small ones
3324188 i expect to see the first sunspots of the next cycle appear in late 2006 or 2007 and solar max to be underway by 2010 or 2011
3324189 based on the characteristics of the eruption this looks like a sure bet to produce a geomagnetic storm
3324190 the cme should reach earth in a little less than 48 hours this would put its arrival around midday on thursday june 8
3324191 but today is the more typical case where a flare is also part of the eruption
3324192 solar flares and cmes occur whenever theres a rapid large scale change in the suns magnetic field the solar active region that produced the eruptions on june 6 had a complicated magnetic configuration oppositely directed magnetic fields were seen right next to each other
3324193 this is an indication that solar maximum is upon us
3324194 to get an intense geomagnetic storm from a cme we believe that two things must happen
3324195 first the disturbance must encounter the earths magnetic field directly as opposed to a glancing blow second the magnetosphere must already have stored energy ready to be released in the form of aurora if either of these two conditions fail were not likely to have an intense auroral display
3324196 hopefully image will be in the right place in its orbit at the right time to see the start of any resulting storm in the earths magnetosphere
3324197 before image if we wanted to understand what happened during a storm like the one thats coming we had to combine thousands of point by point measurements taken by different satellites during many distinct storms
3324198 no single satellite had a continuous global view of all the action
3324199 it would be like trying to understand the rules of major league baseball if you were only allowed to watch a few random moments of different games while wearing blinders that only let you see a little bit of the field at once like the first base line or right field but nothing else
3324200 thats how it is with image and the magnetosphere we can see the whole thing at once for the first time i hate to take advantage of this comparison but with image its a whole new ball game

3324203 unquestionably their best set to date and will no doubt be headlining their own gigs very soon 9 10
3324204 which saw the crowd swinging away like they were in the late 1950s and the rolling stones
3324205 the latter kept bugging me throughout the night and even the next day as i knew it from playing guitar hero it was a very good set with a very good response from the crowd and gave the night a good send off 8 5 10

3324209 la primera mujer que fallece por accidente de trabajo en la comunidad de madrid en lo que va de a o
3324210 no llevaba ninguna prenda en la cabeza que le protegiera
3324211 se ha producido la llegada de cinco cayucos muy seguidas pero con un n mero reducido de personas 61 67 62 84 y 61 en comparaci n con a os anteriores ya que llegaban m s de cien en cada embarcaci n situando la media entre ochenta o noventa inmigrantes por cayuco
3324212 tan s lo una alcanz la costa por sus propios medios concretamente la que lleg a la playa de la troya en playa de las am ricas el pasado 8 de agosto
3324213 de todas formas a adi estas cifras no son m s que meros datos estad sticos y lo importante es que seguimos asistiendo a este drama tremendo que es la inmigraci n irregular
3324214 tambi n ha sido menor en lo que llevamos de a o y ya estamos a la mitad del verano
3324215 muchos factores por ejemplo hay una buena colaboraci n con las autoridades de los pa ses africanos de los que parten los cayucos es decir del norte de marruecos y de la cara occidental de frica mauritania y senegal que son los puntos emisores de inmigraci n clandestina principales
3324216 el trabajo que se est realizando en esos pa ses tanto el trabajo de cooperaci n como la labor diplom tica y el trabajo de vigilancia que se lleva a cabo en esas costas bien con medios espa oles en colaboraci n con medios de esos pa ses o bien con medios de la uni n europea a trav s del frontex
3324217 una buena colaboraci n de las autoridades de estos pa ses tambi n hay una implicaci n importante que se ha conseguido sin duda alguna gracias al inter s y al esfuerzo de espa a y de la uni n europea a trav s del frontex
3324218 tambi n agreg hay una participaci n importante y adem s conjunta de fuerzas de seguridad espa ola con fuerzas de seguridad de esos pa ses que se dedican a la vigilancia de esas costas de hecho ya hay un n mero importante de embarcaciones que se localizan pr cticamente en la salida
3324219 se estaba interpretando que la situaci n econ mica no tan favorable en comparaci n con la de los a os anteriores quiz s pueda estar influyendo en algo en la salida de los inmigrantes desde las costas africanas
3324220 la televisi n tiene que reducir a la mitad el presupuesto del dinero que aporta la junta

3324225 queremos saber si el plan de viabilidad es real o s lo una excusa para hacer un ere
3324226 partimos de una postura de m ximos pero reducir a la mitad el n mero de despidos no es imposible

3324237 i became aware that kris could qualify for scotland a few months ago
3324238 i saw a lot of him when i was manager of derby and he was at nottingham forest
3324239 he transferred to derby in the summer and i had him watched
3324240 i think he will give us a different dimension he is a boy with a lot of ability he is a naturally left sided winger and maybe we have lacked width in the squad
3324241 i spoke to the boy and he was keen and enthusiastic to join the squad
3324242 he made it big despite being fired from his own company
3324243 and before i know i end up narrating the story of his life
3324244 we have an unexpected baby boy do you want him
3324245 if you live each day as if it was your last someday youll most certainly be right
3324246 if today were the last day of my life would i want to do what i am about to do today
3324247 moreover i also gave them my sabaths to be a sign between them and me that they might know that i am the lord who sanctifies them yet the house of isreal rebelled against me in the wilderness they did not walk in my statutes they despised my judgements which if a man does he shall live by them and they greatly defiled my sabaths then i said i would pour out my fury on them
3324248 blessings due to rest as an attribute of the seventh day and subsequent creation memory accorded it speaks for more than sin work and rest

3324250 behold now you are barren and have borne no children but you shall conceive and give birth to a son now therefore be careful not to drink wine or strong drink nor eat any unclean thing for behold you shall conceive and give birth to a son and no razor shall come upon his head for the boy shall be a nazirite to god from the womb and he shall begin to deliver israel from the hands of the philistines
3324251 a man of god came to me and his appearance was like the appearance of the angel of god very awesome

3324253 the presence of the third alternative shifts the focus of the customer if you have two automobiles extolling their fuel efficiency while a third promotes style purchasers pay more attention to the fuel efficiency criterion then when one of the high fuel efficiency cars leaves the market the other fuel efficient car draws consumers in the case of automobiles it might be fuel efficiency and in the case of political candidates it might be health care when the third choice exits the remaining candidate with the most similar attributes becomes the favourite even if they weren t before
3324254 we also call this effect the phantom decoy effect because like pre announced software that is never released these desirable options that become unavailable may never actually exist
3324255 the increase in affinity that a product may receive when a decoy option real or not is removed can mark a significant change in consumer choice in terms of elections even a 5 percent increase in preference makes a huge difference at the ballot box
3324256 we know that parents have tremendous influence over how many fruits and vegetables their children eat
3324257 when parents eat more fruits and vegetables so do their children when parents eat and give their children high fat snacks or soft drinks children learn these eating patterns instead
3324258 overweight children have already been exposed to salty sweet foods and learned to like them
3324259 to keep a child from becoming overweight parents need to expose them early to a variety of healthy foods and offer the foods many times

3324283 virtually all cases of mrsa were either in hospitals or nursing homes now we see it in a whole bunch of other populations
3324284 they were at the time thought to be drugs of last resort because they had activity against a whole variety of multiply resistant gram negative bacteria that were already floating around
3324285 the problem is it is extremely difficult to do a prospective controlled trial because when people come into the hospital they immediately get started on some treatment which ruins the period of study

3324333 and so before i even reached adulthood i suffered from hardening of the arteries mr muse has said that i have a heart of gold sometimes this hardly seems possible as gold in its purest form is soft malleable compliant and my heart my heart is not sure which direction it leans some pieces of it are warm and tender ready to be embraced others are dark and hidden as hard as black marble and yet other pieces of it are fortified with granite armor against the daily siege that life lays on it i always thought that this jadedness was a natural thing that it could not be helped if ive ever always known one thing in my life it is that the heart is not disposable once it is broken the scars remain once it is shattered god help the person that suffers such deep disappointment and pain i do not know if ones heart can be irreparably damaged i dont want to find out but with each time that i have been disposed of it took me a step closer in that direction but there has been a positive in it ive seen the ugliness in human nature ive seen how people can be an irremovable part of your life one day and disappear into oblivion the next ive learned to be glib in the face of this and to focus on the people who are anything but indispensible to me my husband being first and foremost but under the surface lurks a fear it ripples the surface of the pond so very occassionally it is easy to overlook beneath the surface there is always a piece of my heart held in reserve waiting for the day that i become disposable to him too a piece to keep the possibility of irreparable heartbreak from wreaking its devastation on me there is a piece of me that i must cling to for myself so that i may survive no matter what happens there is a piece of myself that i must never dispose of and that no one else will ever be able to either it is the part of me that soars and sings in the face of all things the one part of my heart that will not be broken it gives voice to all things in this life that are worth clinging to i hold it close and hope that i will be able to teach my children to hold that piece of themselves close also

3324561 hinzu kommt dass immer wieder billigware ber drittl nder in die eu eingef hrt worden ist um die z lle zu umgehen
3324562 die qualit t und damit die preise bestimmen letztlich die eink ufer des handels
3324563 die versuchung wird gro sein jetzt billiglampen zu ordern die nicht den geforderten technischen anforderungen der eu entsprechen und eigentlich nicht verkauft werden d rfen

3324581 many scalpers came to me but i couldnt afford the price for that price id rather stay at home and watch tv
3324582 from the tv broadcasts we can see lots of seats are empty
3324583 we cant afford that and people like us who really want to see the games cant get in
3324584 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens

3324587 a game im not interested in can be 100 000 hours long and i dont care maybe if it was one hour and all the attention was put on that one hour the game might be something i could get interested in meanwhile if something is awesome but too short i dont feel value for my investment the goal is to find the sweet spot
3324588 the idea of cloud computing designed around an architecture whose natural state is a shared pool outside the enterprise has gained momentum in recent months as a way to reduce cost and improve it flexibility but the use of cloud computing also carries with it security risks including perils related to compliance availability and data integrity
3324589 a frank and open conversation between sap adobe and a collection of partners and customers
3324590 great show and interesting discussions about the sdn communities and the ownership of knowledge
3324591 over the last couple of years working with the solutions from the sap adobe alliance i have seen the need for information about these products grow steadily
3324592 what are you getting or not getting from the ecosystem
3324593 his main message was that with cloud infrastructures problems dont magically go away they just shift you dont have scalability or storage problems any more but you need to constantly monitor the cloud and your application in it alan pointed out examples when amazons cloud failed and their applications got cut off from the internet as a solution he proposed deploying the application on more than one cloud so that you have resilience this requires writing the application in a way that can be easily ported to different providers which in itself might be a challenge one idea that was really striking was their analysis of getting off the cloud to a dedicated infrastructure again apparently it would take them about three weeks of full bandwidth transfer to download the data that they have in the cloud making it virtually impossible to go back
3324594 which brings me on to the open spaces aspect of the event and the lightning talks putting it about as politely as possible this is the area most in need of improvement for next time wed set a limit of ten minutes per talk which of course everyone effortlessly broke this was entirely my fault for not bringing a stop watch and baseball bat next time all lightning talks will be ruthlessly limited possibly using an ignite format admittedly some speakers were so engaging that the time flew by and the questions could have gone on all night but thats why we brought beer and pizza secondly this was the first open spaces event for many people who came i must confess to having been nervous about this beforehand and on the web site had asked people to propose talks or topics about twelve people were enthusiastic or sympathetic enough to offer talks i figured this would be enough to motivate others to step up from the audience but aside from one or two fluent folks such as mark masterson it just did not happen argh at the sf event there were many talks and many people who like to talk was london cloudcamp making people laconic or worse yet shy based on the fantastic atmosphere throughout and the great conversations people had till late in the evening i dont think so i think we can make the format much better one idea is to have more smaller rooms and start with an hour or two of open spaces unconference then mingle over beers and have a few really rapid fire talks after that please do comment on this blog if you have suggestions

3324602 in one of the rooms there was a substantial amount of blood it was a vicious attack
3324603 we havent recovered the weapons from the scene so we are basing what kind of weapons were used on pathological evidence and that is not an exact science
3324604 it really is a case of keeping an open mind at this time
3324605 they should know georgia will never surrender i directly accuse russia of ethnic cleansing
3324606 the bombs hit in front of us and beside us
3324607 several people were wounded and lying in the street we got straight out of there
3324608 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

3324649 its 11 versus 11 and they have everything to gain and we have everything to lose
3324650 as a team coming to wolves its a great position for them to be in they want to cause an upset and if they want to make a name for themselves its a nice position to be in
3324651 i have no problems with the draw i dont worry about things i cant affec id prefer this tie than say sheffield united away
3324652 if you looked at the team that played the previous saturday it was a strong enough team maybe there were a couple of youngsters who played
3324653 its fairly ironic that the goalkeeper graham stack that let one in under his body was bloody outstanding on saturday
3324654 its a first team and whatever side is picked theres not one of them you could say im trying him out
3324655 we knew from our own observations that there were a lot of gorillas out there but we had no idea there were so many

3324661 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3324662 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3324663 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a significant and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3324664 these actions would be inconsistent with assurance that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo in south ossetia that existed before fighting began
3324665 we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country

3324709 wir hatten nach der meisterschaft im vergangenen sommer viele verletzungsprobleme und mussten dann spieler einsetzen die noch nicht fit waren dieses jahr konnten wir in der vorbereitung alles durchziehen deshalb glaube ich das wir dieses jahr besser sind

3324711 its not so much social networking its having a social experience around things that we care about so pets are just such a great example of that
3324712 social networks like facebook and myspace are sort of about you and your friends and these very direct connections but theres all sorts of other types of connections

3324752 we need a veterans campaign because education was the number one reason 96 percent of us enlisted
3324753 i dont think its going to cost the state that much
3324754 the best way to clear up the issue is qualify all vets for in state tuition that will certainly help at fort bliss
3324755 this is a low cost way of blanketing the state

3325136 workers have been angered that pay is 25 30 per cent lower than other control centres once the managers engage with that issue then well start talking
3325137 but as no real progress has been made industrial action has happened ministerial targets have also been withdrawn so weve not done time sheets since last may and things like that
3325138 i imagine if there was an incident they would have coped quite adequately
3325139 absolutely nobody here wants to see the loss of any lives i think people who live close enough to the coastguard could be called in an emergency
3325140 the strike was tremendous in terms of those who supported it right across the country across the 19 coastguards
3325141 what they are asking for is comparability of emergency services as an emergency service themselves they should be paid the same amount it was not a step that was taken lightly
3325142 one of the problems is the government pay is really low and theyve got hands behind their back as the public sector pay rise is capped at two per cent the mca effectively doesnt have the resources or the money to pay a decent wage
3325143 the government and the management have got to address it its an unacceptable situation when we have got people working in control rooms co ordinating searches and rescues and getting paid less than someone working in a burger joint we are hoping that they would say yes and hammer out a deal
3325144 the workers feel let down and betrayed by a refusal to pay them the same as other emergency services and by below inflation pay rises which are cutting their pay in real terms coastguards provide a vital emergency service and ensure the safety of shipping in british waters
3325145 it is a scandal that pay rates are so low and that watch assistants who help save lives should get a special pay rise to bring them up to the level of the national minimum wage
3325146 we await for pcs to return to the table for further discussions the mca are keen to discuss the future with the pcs
3325147 if i finish in the top 10 i will gain selection for the olympics
3325148 in south africa it was set in an amazing lake right in the heart of the western cape mountains it was crystal blue water really still and nice and warm perfect conditions for me to do my first race
3325149 british swimming had convinced me to enter this race as it was part of the process to qualify for the event at the olympics
3325150 i had to finish in the top two out of the brits which would gain me selection for the world open water champs in seville where the top 10 from there would qualify for the olympic games
3325151 the way i saw it it was a chance for me to have a go at something different no pressure and it would be a good hard workout
3325152 i was very pleased as i know i am in good shape and now have something else in swimming to have a go at
3325153 despite the long demanding effort it was actually quite good fun
3325154 when its raining or dark i try and do some indoor exercise like swimming i do it whenever i can but they suggest no more than four times a week to rest and build up the strength in your muscles
3325155 i gained five and a half stones in just over five months from 69kg to 107kg it was like a monster had overtaken my body i was snappy caused by the steroid factory my body was producing and my body was totally the wrong shape
3325156 i had tubes in both arms as well as a plaster cast on my hand from severing tendons in my hand a month before and i had 18 clips on my left leg after surgery
3325157 my nose was blocked with stuffing my right leg was effectively my only functioning limb
3325158 im sure the beatles had a much better time of it
3325159 most of our patients take hydrocortisone as a hormone and if the patient becomes ill they must have an increased dose of it as an injection the difficulty is that most city accident and emergency dont understand it or recognise it and failure to do this can and has on many occasions lead to a patient going into a coma and die
3325160 we are the only pituitary organisation in the uk and we do have to work extremely hard to raise any kind of awareness simply because a lot of people dont know what the pituitary gland is what it does and what happens when it goes wrong
3325161 if you say to someone ive got a tumour in my pituitary gland they ask what that is
3325162 around 36 000 people run in the race and all of them have had different experiences and different lives
3325163 hardly any of them will make the olympics but they can all take part in the race ninety eight per cent of people finish it the oldest person running this year is 101
3325164 i want to finish i think the atmosphere on the day will carry me through
3325165 i want to make the best of my time set myself challenges and achieve them it is not the end of your life you can still achieve you might just have to go about it a different way that is what i want to tell people

3325168 we often dont really know what other people do people often get us confused with the dvla with issues like tax disc issues
3325169 one criticism of the day was that we should have asked the environmental agency although im not entirely sure what they do either
3325170 there is no database for foreign licence plates its the biggest headache what is also very frustrating is when people tax their car but dont display their tax disk its absurd
3325171 it is the tip of the iceberg for every door we choose
3325172 in rhymney street before christmas i went into one completely empty house one evening theyd had a few drinks and had gone out there were ipods laptops a bike and a tv it was so stupid and it happens all the time
3325173 one of the girls living next door was friends with them and she gave me his number when i rang it and told him the police were in his house he swore at me and gave me lots of abuse i eventually persuaded him i was telling the truth and he came over and naturally was very embarrassed
3325174 what sam is doing to help link students with the community is invaluable
3325175 people are so willing to shift responsibility if even half of one street actually spoke to each other for half an hour think what a difference that would make the first people they blame when something goes wrong are the people who have to deal with it the police
3325176 we will be doing another one next month in plasnewydd and one the following month in gabalfa

3325185 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3325186 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3325187 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3325188 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3325189 however because of the poor visibility of the night some previously recorded foots may have been used
3325190 it is all about projecting the right image of china with no respect for honesty or for the audience

3325198 i dont think russia will feel like talking with mr saakashvili after what he did to our citizens
3325199 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3325200 this tidal wave against president pervez musharraf shows that all democratic forces are together for his impeachment
3325201 the best option for musharraf is that he should resign
3325202 no resolution passed by any provincial assembly has any relevance to the impeachment of the president and if the coalition has any case it must follow the proper course by moving a motion in the parliament
3325203 im gutted of course because i was totally primed up to attend the media event but at this point in time im actually having difficulty getting out of bed

3325234 by government reckoning a depressed area is one in which at least 6 of the workers are unemployed and the total has run at least 50 above the national average for four of the last five years the u s has 19 major depressed areas and dozens of minor ones scattered from washington to maine most of them concentrated in the industrial east
3325235 president elect john f kennedy has put a depressed areas bill at the top of his list of must legislation
3325236 though by no means the happiest country in the world from a global perspective the u s looks pretty good
3325237 the country is not only prosperous it ranks relatively high in gender equality tolerance of ethnic and social diversity and has high levels of political freedom
3325238 americans dissatisfaction with the countrys current direction pulls down their sense of subjective well being
3325239 but this is partly offset by other factors the fact that americans live in a free and tolerant society has more impact on happiness than economic prosperity or even additional income
3325240 ultimately the most important determinant of happiness is the extent to which people have free choice in how to live their lives
3325241 the relative importance of economic prosperity to happiness changes as societies get richer
3325242 in low income countries ones economic situation has a huge impact on happiness but among more prosperous countries political freedom and social tolerance play a greater role in determining how happy people are
3325243 to some extent well designed social policy can help raise u s happiness levels even more
3325244 policies that help increase the societys sense of solidarity and tolerance may also help
3325245 supplementing cows with rbst on an industry wide scale would improve sustainability and reduce the dairy industrys contribution to water acidification algal growth and global warming
3325246 the environmental impact of recombinant bovine somatotropin rbst use in dairy production
3325247 sustainability is important in agricultural production with an emphasis placed upon meeting human food requirements while mitigating environmental impact
3325248 this study demonstrates that use of rbst markedly improves the efficiency of milk production mitigates environmental impact including greenhouse gas emissions and reduces natural resource requirements such as fossil fuel water and land use
3325249 every decade has seen breakthroughs in solving the puzzles this protein presented yet exactly how small ligands such as oxygen or carbon monoxide co migrate to the deeply buried binding site and out again was never completely resolved in my opinion
3325250 some of these sites were previously known but we found more
3325251 ligands follow the openings as they occur in the protein
3325252 it has been thoroughly studied and has been key in elucidating many basic principles of the structure to function paradigm
3325253 our solution is on the edge of what is currently possible computation wise so virginia techs systemx supercomptuer was very helpful
3325254 the consensus is that small non polar ligands such as oxygen co and nitric oxide follow basically the same pathways as oxygen ligands
3325255 alternatively we can place the ligand in water outside of the protein and occasionally observe it enter the protein and make its way all the way to the binding site
3325256 there is enough computational capacity in modern supercomputers to simulate enough of these events at room temperature to make statistically justified conclusions
3325257 another type of computation uses simple but highly effective techniques from computational geometry and graph theory to look for space available for ligand migration based on free volume in the protein for this one we used snapshots from an md simulation to find cavities in the myoglobin protein big enough to hold the ligand then we connected the dots by computing the union of the cavities across all the snapshots and we clearly saw the pathways these looked very similar to the ones we saw directly by following individual ligand trajectories
3325258 over all both methods complemented each other to provide a clear simple picture of what was going on
3325259 there are many biomedically relevant systems that are much less understood particularly as it concerns pathways which are critical to protein function

3325261 this work would have passed out of view if alexey onufriev had not been stubborn tenacious and dedicated
3325262 this project would not have come together as well if we were missing any part of the team
3325263 each of us brought our expertise to use computational methods both pure computer science and biophysical to study the migration pathways on a resolution that is not quite attainable to experimentalists and we were very lucky to have a resource such as virginia techs own supercomputer system x

3325268 not surprisingly speakers of different languages describe events using the word orders prescribed by their language the surprise is that when the same speakers are asked to speak with their hands and not their mouths they ignore these orders they all use exactly the same order when they gesture
3325269 the natural order of events how speakers of different languages represent events nonverbally
3325270 our data suggest that the ordering we use when representing events in a nonverbal format is not highly susceptible to languages influence
3325271 rather there appears to be a natural order that humans use when asked to represent events nonverbally indeed the influence may well go in the other direction the ordering seen in our nonverbal tasks may shape language in its emerging stages

3325278 in developing this discussion lets be clear what an asia pacific community is not
3325279 it is not an economic union it is not a monetary union it is not at this stage even a customs union it is a concept and it is certainly not a political union

3325318 die kostenanpassungen f r wasser abwasser und m ll liegen z b in wien unterhalb der gesamtinflationsrate aber selbst wenn man die absoluten zahlen betrachtet so beeinflussen diese die mietkosten nur im promille bereich der wahre preistreiber ist der st ndig steigende mietzins der von den vermietern in rechnung gestellt wird

3325407 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country

3325432 die einigung auf das neue pflegepaket bringt entlastungen f r rund 400 000 sterreicherinnen auch aus der sicht behinderter menschen ist dieser beschluss ein wichtiger schritt besonders freut mich dass sich die vp mit zentralen forderungen durchsetzen konnte
3325433 eine sinnvolle l sung denn ab der pflegestufe vier geht es um die frage ob pflegebed rftige menschen weiter zuhause leben k nnen oder ins heim m ssen
3325434 ein notwendiger und guter entschluss denn bei der bisher praktizierte einstufung von behinderten kindern wurde die leistung der betreuenden eltern und personen oft unterbewertet
3325435 das waren zentrale forderungen der vp und ich bin froh dass wir uns durchsetzen konnten
3325436 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3325437 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3325438 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3325439 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3325440 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3325441 becoming more and more acceptable and being taken advantage of by some young men in a way that conflicts with the rules and regulations of islam
3325442 using cats and dogs to make passes at women and pester families
3325443 it was not an easy decision to leave all that and return to a totally destroyed

3325451 ive been impressed by all of them theyve been working and pushing me as well
3325452 i have a little tightness and trouble with flexibility and range of motion pollard said
3325453 we played three last year you use as many as you have they all have strengths and weaknesses if someone takes over thats fine but i dont foresee that happening especially early in the year
3325454 we came out it was probably one of our best practices to be honest with you
3325455 thats a good sign full pads two days out of a game and guys came with a chip on their shoulder which you want because you dont feel good about saturday
3325456 we have a lot of work to do we chose to come back here and maintain our camp mode which is important we certainly have things we have to get done this week
3325457 put the pads on it would be really easy for them to come out and be too fired up about that
3325458 there are some sore guys on this team were playing like every other team in the league were playing with some short numbers at some positions and it would be easy for guys to sit there and kind of have that woe is me attitude and there was none of that
3325459 we know we have to go out there this week and improve a lot as a team because were preparing for the next game on our preseason schedule and were preparing for some other things
3325460 you cant come out and let that other stuff let get you down

3325462 ubs will continue its program to reduce personnel levels costs and risk
3325463 in terms of oil fundamentals crude and product supply tightness has eased
3325464 we continue to stress the supply uncertainty thats out there the events over the past week in georgia and turkey have only reconfirmed that

3325472 russell would not have wanted this to be a sad or over solemn occasion
3325473 he said he was going to take three books with him a trashy novel john stuart mill on liberty and my autobiography
3325474 he reminded me also with some glee that but for his own failure to be selected in 1962 as prospective candidate for roxburgh selkirk amp peebles i would never have become an mp
3325475 he was looking forward to celebrating his 76th birthday he died the day before it and was entertaining on the subject of his bone cancer
3325476 only i had to sign a piece of paper promising not to have unprotected sex with anybody
3325477 i am glad that we had that last evening together and guess what was waiting for us when we returned home after our cruise a postcard from russell warm and generous as always
3325478 i had heard of russell johnston before i ever met him
3325479 harold wilsons labour government was sympathetic and his secretary of state willie ross especially impressed he and russell worked closely together on the legislation setting up the hidb and he later appointed russell to the royal commission on local government under lord wheatley
3325480 it was said of the great london architect sir christopher wren when he died
3325481 he was devoted to his constituents and they to him
3325482 he took the oath in the commons wearing his kilt complete with skian dhu in spite of the ban on the carrying of offensive weapons in the chamber
3325483 one of his great attributes in the commons was his humour
3325484 a c h t h i n e it stands for ach tae hell its near enough
3325485 by the time of the successful post 1997 scotland act he had moved on to his third great passion europe
3325486 he had been appointed as one of the british meps when we first joined the european community in the 1970s again taking his seat in the kilt and was disappointed not to be elected to it in 1979
3325487 he was especially interested in the bringing in of the countries which had been behind the iron curtain and his booklets of presidential speeches are peppered with photographs of him with politicians of unpronounceable names as well as more familiar figures such as kofi annan and the pope
3325488 in 1993 he sat up till 3am with radovan karadzic trying unsuccessfully no doubt over a slivervic or two to persuade him to accept the negotiated bosnian peace plan and warning him of the dire consequences if he refused
3325489 of course all this activity so much appreciated internationally was at the expense of any normal domestic life and he was the first to admit as he did that reminiscing evening to being a less than exemplary husband and father devoted though he and his sons were to each other
3325490 in the 5th century bc the poet and philosopher hereclitus was renowned for the elegance of his style so much so that his works became known as his nightingales
3325491 you dont change the taste of the whisky by changing the shape of the bottle
3325492 what are the words which come to mind when we think of him decency humour commitment passion friendship tolerance fairness justice
3325493 let me end with just one typical quote from his introduction in my copyof his volume of scottish conference speeches which he affectionately and over flatteringly inscribed to me after the 1979 election
3325494 language can sometimes be inadequate to represent feeling but for me liberalism is a positive balance it is centre in the sense that people of liberal disposition are motivated always to seek to bridge the differences between people rather than simply to pick and condemn one group outright for intransigence or stupidity or malice how to reconcile free men and women with each other without force that is the aim of the liberal how to build a society which is law abiding and caring thrustful yet protective creative and respectful tolerant yet responsible just yet kind dispassionate yet compassionate in the translation of the latin liber free and generous the perpetual search for ways of reconciling order with understanding stricture with sympathy hope with reality it is a profoundly radical approach going to the root of all problems in a society which regards kindness as boring compassion as weak fairness as foolish and it is difficult and it is complicated and it does not appeal to the self interested or the self righteous or the simplistic or the militant a credo with a valid claim to provide the basic rules for human society cannot be other than complex and full of ifs and buts and perhaps es

3325570 en el mercat de la barceloneta com ja va passar amb el de santa caterina shan gastat unes quantitats extraordin ries de diners per a renovar los per shan acabat fent sembla m s pensant en criteris est tics que no en les activitats que han dacollir

3325577 el que no pot ser s que quan qualsevol comunitat aut noma de lestat espantol defensi els seus interessos sigui solidaridaritat i que quan catalunya vol defensar els seus sigui victimisme en el millor dels casos o xantatge en el pitjor
3325578 aquell estatut que segons alguns no servia per a res ara ens permet que el pa s shi pugui agafar

3325596 aside from the ability to obtain real time price and availability information the real time application will allow sales reps to obtain product data sheets and provides links to manufacturing websites relating to the products included in the quote by giving the sales representative as much information upfront and in a real time environment a company stands a greater chance of winning the sale and more importantly the customer

3325617 les seves explicacions tenen poca import ncia perqu ja sha evidenciat que els seus incompliments es deuen a manca de voluntat pol tica

3325619 no nom s podem estar dacord en qu no estem dacord amb la proposta del ministre solbes sin que hem destar units per defensar all que volem per a catalunya
3325620 crec que a principis de setembre es podr presentar una proposta catalana
3325621 ja sest produint un fet molt positiu partits com erc que va votar en contra de lestatut o com el psc amb lactual president montilla al front que va presentar esmenes per rebaixar el text avui es trenquen la cara per defensar all que lestatut estableix en mat ria de finan ament
3325622 des dels seus c rrecs al govern aquesta s la seva obligaci del conseller castells i del presidnet montilla
3325623 des de les files del psc fora del govern existeix un silenci preocupant

3325625 si ell no executa el 100 dall que lestatut estableix sobre finan ament els partits catalans incloent hi el psc no hem daprovar els seus pressupostos
3325626 si ell no compleix amb catalunya catalunya no t perqu complir amb el govern central

3325632 many scalpers came to me but i couldnt afford the price for that price id rather stay at home and watch tv

3325637 rakan kita dalam dap pula memperjuangkan rakyat keseluruhannya dan ini pakatan merupakan platform bersama
3325638 dan saya rasa ucapan tuan guru abdul hadi itu menegaskan perlunya masyarakat malaysia menerima perjuangan mereka untuk memperjuangkan agama islam dan ummah sebagai salah satu perjuangan yang tidak boleh ditolak ansur
3325639 itu satu kenyataan dalam pakatan ini saya fikir dalam musyawarah mesyuarat sudah tentu ada tolak ansur dan sebagainya apa pun dasar dasar pas itu perlu dipertahankan
3325640 dan saya fikir untuk membawa dasar seperti itu tentang ahli ahli pakatan yang lain patut dihormati pendapat masing masing dalam penghormatan itulah saya fikir kita dapat satu kesepaduan terhadap sesuatu matlamat yang kita perjuangkan

3325642 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3325643 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3325644 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3325645 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3325646 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

3325649 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3325650 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3325651 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3325652 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3325653 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3325654 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3325655 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3325656 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3325657 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3325658 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3325659 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3325660 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3325661 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3325662 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3325663 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3325664 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3325665 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3325666 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3325667 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3325668 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3325669 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3325670 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3325671 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3325672 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3325673 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3325674 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3325675 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3325676 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3325677 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3325678 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3325679 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

3325681 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3325682 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3325683 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3325684 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3325685 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3325686 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3325687 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3325688 who are open to doing something on the production side
3325689 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3325690 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3325691 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3325692 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3325693 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3325694 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3325695 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3325696 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3325697 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3325698 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3325699 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3325700 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3325701 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3325702 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3325703 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

3325709 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3325710 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

3325719 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3325720 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3325721 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3325722 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3325723 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3325724 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3325725 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3325726 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3325727 are they aware that the festival will be over by september people have come a very long way to perform and attend the festival and september is simply too late
3325728 there are people out there i have spoken to who have made the effort to see my own show and couldnt this is costing me money and i am sure it is the same for 90 of the other shows out there
3325729 ive got potentially empty houses due to their the organisers incompetence and people have paid good money for a service that hasnt been delivered
3325730 a lot of people are feeling quite let down and it is very frustrating
3325731 were selling tickets audiences are getting in to see shows and our focus right now is on making the festival continue to flourish
3325732 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3325733 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

3325763 die afrika swerwer kingsley holgate skryf by sy tuiskoms in suid afrika n n besoek aan 33 afrika lande
3325764 dit mag so wees dat baie swart suid afrikaners ons land as n paradys beleef n wat hulle tydens apartheid beleef het maar vir die meeste wit suid afrikaners glo ek het die land n hel geword
3325765 waarom dit so is wil ek nie op ingaan nie
3325766 vir wit suid afrikaners is daar net een van twee moontlikhede gee pad uit die land of bly aanvaar die hel en word medebouer aan die opbou van die land
3325767 vir engelssprekende wit suid afrikaners is die keuse nie so moeilik nie
3325768 maar baie gaan bly sommige uit eie keuse maar die meeste ni omdat hulle in hierdie
3325769 oor die afrikaner glyers wil ek net s ek is oortuig mense wat suid afrika verlaat omdat hulle nie bereid is om langer met die werklikhede van die land saam te leef nie is lafaards wat nie die moed het om die hitte van die stryd te verduur nie
3325770 as die gevaar verby is gaan hulle tien teen een almal weer wil terugkom na die suid afrika paradys
3325771 wat staan die afrikaners wat w l en mo t bly te doen
3325772 dan kan met die wit afrikaners gebeur wat met die wit franse burgers van algeri gebeur het n onafhanklikheidswording
3325773 is daar hoop dat afrikaners so n katastrofe kan vermy
3325774 daarom glo ek eerder aan die wyse raad van oudregter h a fagan wat nie deur die afrikaners eintlik as n ware afrikaner beskou is nie by geleentheid het hy ges die enigste hoop wat afrikaners het om hier voort te bestaan is dat hulle hulself nuttig sal maak vir die land
3325775 om onsself nuttig en daardeur onmisbaar te maak sal van afrikaners vereis om in n figuurlike sin te vlug n terselfdertyd te veg te vlug van ons diep gewortelde denke dat ons as afrikaners spesiale erkenning en behandeling verdien omdat ons hierdie land mak gemaak het sonder om te erken dat ons dit nie sou kon doen sonder die hande van die swartes nie
3325776 die afrikaners sal moet besluit om die drake berge op die pad van hul voortbestaan in suid afrika kaalvoet sonder skoene van aansprake oor te steek dan sal hulle kan bydra om suid afrika tot n besondere land te maak ja selfs n paradys vir al sy inwoners ek glo ons k n dit doen

3325805 ive had the vet go all over her and he cant find anything wrong
3325806 the only thing different with her on saturday was she looked really agitated before the race and she didnt seem to be herself
3325807 her blood count wasnt perfect but there was nothing seriously wrong with it
3325808 she just didnt appear to be the same horse as she normally is on race days
3325809 theyre both coming home and will go out for a decent six week spell
3325810 it was a long trip down it took more than 14 hours
3325811 both of them appeared to be okay when they got to sydney but you can never tell how much a trip like that takes out of horses
3325812 overnight he got a bit of a temperature and a stomach bug and unfortunately we wont be accepting with him for saturday
3325813 ive had a couple of horses in the stable with upset stomachs and unfortunately kc has it now
3325814 hell have a couple of soft days now and i certainly want him to be spot on next time he comes out which we are hoping will be in the concorde
3325815 he had a clean bill of health after the race and up until yesterday was going very well
3325816 im finding it hard to gauge the horses fitness running on it viscoride
3325817 i probably made a mistake giving him one trial at rosehill on the grass he did that so easily i didnt up the workload
3325818 and the pace of a group race first up ended up too much for him and it was probably a little bit of my inexperience showing through but i wont be making the same mistake again
3325819 he won by 3 1 2 lengths at bendigo but the form out of the race hasnt been anything great
3325820 the second horse fulsome has since gone no good 10th at ballarat and the third horse olivets girl was 100 1 and finished sixth at bendigo last week
3325821 having said that you can only beat what is there and he is an improving horse
3325822 hes starting off tomorrow because the countback from the epsom works in well for him
3325823 i want to run him next over 1350 metres at doomben in a fortnight and then go to the cameron at newcastle
3325824 but if i dont go that way i could give him three runs in brisbane then run him in a 1400 metre race at randwick the week before the epsom
3325825 hes a very good back up horse so im not worried going that way if we have to but right now i prefer the cameron
3325826 im a great believer in not giving geldings that are aged five or more too long a break because they lose their muscle too quick
3325827 thats why it takes older horses like him so long to get fit if they have longer breaks
3325828 he can run a sharp 1000 metres but his record over it isnt great
3325829 the only time hes been over the distance he failed but ill be happy if he comes through this race in good order for the spring races ive got planned
3325830 i hope it will do as much for olympic sports as ours in 1983 did for cricket
3325831 i have truly formed and developed real relationships with lovely interesting people i havent yet or may never meet in the real world in that respect its much more like a forum than a facebook

3325836 il risultato va valutato in un arco di tempo pi lungo e i report dei primi sei mesi di applicazione parlano chiaro in centro entra il venti per cento in meno delle auto e i risultati ci sono stati anche sul fronte dellinquinamento se tutti i mesi fossero come questo luglio non avremmo problemi di smog visto che non c stato alcun superamento dei valori soglia

3325873 der n chste betrug an den w hlern steht unmittelbar bevor
3325874 daran will auch ich mich halten glaubw rdigkeit ist ein kriterium an dem sich die spd messen lassen muss
3325875 das kann nicht wahr sein dass wir im westen von deutschland dar ber reden juniorpartner der linkspartei zu sein wo ist eigentlich der stolz der spd auf eigene st rke wie kann man dar ber nachdenken gegen ber einer solchen partei in die zweite reihe zu r cken
3325876 das verh ltnis der linken zu rechtsstaat und verfassungsschutz muss gekl rt werden

3325878 die kombination eines unerprobten pr sidenten ohne eigene hausmacht mit dem starken mann russlands als ministerpr sident ist ein novum in der russischen politik die bisher stets auf eine einmannleitung angelegt war

3325881 we want a season of success both in the sm liiga and in the champions hockey league therefore we have the need to extend our roster
3325882 in the chl we can potentially earn up to 1 7m in prize money
3325883 we wanted to stage a unique event and were thus looking for a game at an enormous altitude
3325884 i felt a bit dizzy at the beginning but eventually i could get ready for the game
3325885 dark but never dangerous the music seems to originate from the deepest corner of the human soul phylls dark and possessed harmonies will lead the seduced listener to another world which we can only reach via dreams or meditation

3325888 i believe in mr grieves but i refuse to believe in c css or any of your tomfoolery shenanigans and bamboozlery
3325889 i believe that was my first and will be my only time to check out a book from a ut library weird
3325890 i wish i had this training when i was there before
3325891 it helps take away the enemys advantage on us i know what i am looking for now
3325892 we give them the ability to think like the enemy
3325893 we can now see if anybody has been there and if we are being tracked
3325894 you are never going to see the world the same
3325895 we can read body language now and i know what i am looking for
3325896 however anecdotal evidence and after action reports from commanders in theater say that this training is saving lives the measure of success right now is when a marine returns from a patrol convoy or standing a post and is excited that he used the combat hunter training
3325897 theres no turning back that train is going down the path napster started it and its not going any other direction
3325898 it was the one place that advertising hasnt been entrenched properly into the content itself
3325899 you look at every other example video tv and motion picture have done a great job of integrating advertisers and theres been a big value there but nothing in the music world made sense
3325900 it just makes sense right gas prices may go up but free still works thats not going to impact our fan bases decisions
3325901 the young artists intuit that if you have millions of people that think youre great youre going to make money somewhere
3325902 if something like this introduces you to new faces new ears then actually does have a backside where the compensation is nominal boy it would be worth a lot
3325903 i actually think even the major labels are starting to wake up to the fact after seeing what nine inch nails could do or what radiohead could do theyre all kind of saying we need to partner with these people
3325904 we dont want to be the guys who are competing for the 99 cents its not our model
3325905 our model is taking fresh new content and putting it out in an ad supported way free for the fanbase when the labels are ready to address that well work with them

3325909 was die kooperation in bezug auf s dossetien angeht so sind wir nat rlich sehr entt uscht
3325910 wir werden unsere einsch tzungen dessen was passiert nicht verstecken und alle fragen so offen wie m glich stellen und rechnen damit dass wir dadurch unsere partner zu einer ehrlichen er rterung der probleme aufrufen
3325911 mit den usa wurde dieser dialog faktisch bis zum letzten tag vor den aggressionsakten georgiens gegen s dossetien gef hrt und uns wurde st ndig mitgeteilt die usa w rden der georgischen f hrung alle notwendigen signale schicken und sie vor einem kriegsabenteuer warnen
3325912 wir haben in den vergangenen jahren den einfluss solcher signale auf herrn saakaschwili gesp rt als wir genaue informationen ber seine vorhaben hatten und diese in der folge jedoch nicht realisiert wurden damals sprachen wir unseren amerikanischen kollegen unsere anerkennung daf r aus dass sie den georgischen f hrer vor unvern nftigen und verh ngnisvollen handlungen zur ckhalten
3325913 eine solche resolution m sste ausgesprochen exakte qualifizierung von dem enthalten was dort geschehen ist
3325914 ein ausgebranntes feld w re aber ein passendes synonym denn genau so sieht heute zchinwali aus
3325915 mit seiner barbarischen aktion in s dossetien ruinierte er die zuverl ssigkeit seines landes er best tigte ein weiteres mal dass ossetische und abchasische v lker in georgien nicht in sicherheit leben k nnen
3325916 wir haben dies michail nikolajewistch saakaschwili sogar mehrmals auf h chster ebene gesagt damals schien es uns dass er begreift worum es geht nun sieht es so aus dass er es immer noch nicht begriffen hat
3325917 bobby is a very big part of what we do offensively
3325918 but injuries are a part of this thing and you deal with it the young ones have to step up and play weve said that already and now they just have to do it for a while
3325919 die vom tifliser regime in s dossetien begangenen verbrechen verdienen es vom internationalen tribunal behandelt zu werden

3325921 wir gehen einfach davon aus dass saakaschwili nicht mehr unser partner sein kann es w re auch besser wenn er gehen w rde
3325922 hat es aber frau dr rice f r m glich befunden ihre europ ischen amtskollegen der reihe nach anzurufen und zu erkl ren wir h tten beschlossen saakaschwili zu st rzen erst danach w rden wir angeblich die milit roperation einstellen

3325951 today the u s team gained a lot of momentum
3325952 i think part of that came from the mens 4x100 freestyle relay yesterday that was probably the most amazing swim ive ever seen it got a lot of us really really pumped up for the rest of the meet
3325953 the way jason lezak finished that race that really moved me inside
3325954 i had very strong training but for whatever reason the last few days before the meet began i wasnt feeling as strong as i was hoping to

3325981 simply a british adaption of a malay dish are there earlier english references to this dish
3325982 to make it they throw the mixture of shrimps and small fish into a sort of weak pickle made with salt and water and put it into a tight earthen vessel or jar
3325983 originally i thought that dampier may have incorrectly recorded this name as i could find no modern usage of this term in vietnam for shrimp fish paste however another 16th century european in the cochin chinese now southern vietnam city of hoi an describes the following
3325984 the cochin chinese use a kind of sauce which they call balachiam made of salt fish macerated and steeped in water this is a sharp liquor not unlike mustard and serves to sharpen the appetite to the rice which they cannot eat without it and for this reason those who can afford it lay in large stocks of it as europeans do their stores of wine
3325985 was a british attempt at malay belachan was found in the
3325986 gnapee or nga pee is made of prawns shrimps or any cheap fish pounded into a consistent mass and frequently allowed to become partially putrid it is known in commerce by the name of balachong and largely consumed as a condiment to rice in all the countries to the east of bengal including the southern part of china and the islands of the eastern archipelago its distribution gives rise to an extensive internal trade and like the herrings and salt fish with the negro population of the west indies it forms to the natives a palatable addition to their ordinary food
3325987 an indian dish called ballachong 1845 take a pint of picked shrimps a pint of sour apples finely chopped mix and shake them in a stew pan to dry a little over the fire take one pound of butter two cloves of garlic and one onion chopped very fine pepper and salt to taste a spoonful of curry powder and cayenne mixed fry the onion and garlic in the butter and the other ingredients fry together put them whole into a jar and cover close when wanted for use fry a piece in small quantities dipped in butter
3325988 balachong a kind of cake formed of dried fish pounded up with salt and spices and then allowed to ferment freely the best sort or the red balachong is made of shrimps the black or common sort is made of other small fish it is esteemed a great delicacy by the malays and chinese with whom it forms an article of extensive commerce
3325989 the greatest burmese delicacy is ngapee putrid shrimps salted beaten and dried no meal that a burman makes would be complete without this ingredient large quantities are sent up the rivers and the king of ava admits it as a delicacy within the gilded portals of his palace
3325990 although descriptions of this condiment sound more similar to a fermented fish sauce there are also scatter references to similar dishes though out se asia and even in sri lanka
3325991 are related both in name and in preparation to the anglo indian
3325992 calcutta 1900 the name is essentially that of the portuguese colonies however the recipe actually suggest the use of fermented shrimp paste from malaysia
3325993 the british had no influence on indian food or eating habits

3326008 this is not the second coming of the satanic verses
3326009 id received very positive feedback from organisers of the mwa and being a previous winner was advised i was hot favourite to win for a second year running however when i asked the judges for feedback on my novel they told me that it had not been included in the submissions they were asked to judge it was only then that i realised my work was being censored by the muslims writers awards project
3326010 because my creative effort is being treated as if its somehow unclean and unworthy clearly the muslim writers awards has decided that the novel is so unpalatable for them that it needs to be buried
3326011 im deeply dismayed that a project like this which is supposed to unearth new talent and celebrate artistic expression has been hijacked by the puritan mindset yes its true that not all the muslim characters in my book are model citizens however this is just a reflection of the realities we face today
3326012 its unseemly that my novel is being treated as if its the second coming of the satanic verses i have created a work of fiction which is neither blasphemous nor disrespectful towards any particular group or individual

3326069 basically the french recipe is talking about the preserved candied rind of citron
3326070 recipe and indeed this is what turns out to be the case
3326071 that while glasse sourced a great deal of material from
3326072 the author s of this work copied their recipes wordfor word from several other earlier books
3326073 recipe is a direct copy the french text for this recipe is also very interesting
3326074 it can be seen by comparing this recipe with the earlier beignets recipe from massialot that la chapelle has not so much as copied massialot as reinterpreted and expanded his recipes in fact this process of reinterpretation and expansion of massialots work characterises many of la chapelles recipes in massialots recipe for lecorce de citron vert confit hache bien menu

3326076 the rasped rind of a green lemon and candied lemon peel

3326079 this recipe is describes the production of a choux type pastry fritters doughnuts and finishes with the phrase

3326081 concerning citron at no period in history would a french cookbook writer have used the term

3326106 for the fans sake i am really happy for them
3326107 we heard from instructors that they dont have the technical expertise budget or time to create a professional looking online presence and so thats exactly what weve created for them
3326108 as a fitness professional i think this site is exactly what is needed to promote ourselves and our clubs without asking our members to join social networks that can be unsafe or inappropriate i think many of my students and staff will use this site to connect
3326109 we believe one reason for our impressive growth is that we have inspired our members to think beyond just fitness and wellness and more in terms of a personal and fun approach to their health something we like to call being healthalicious
3326110 beyou tv lets me try some workouts that i would be too shy to do in front of a class full of strangers i also travel a lot so accessing beyou tv from my hotel room is like taking all of my favorite instructors on the road with me my beyou tv membership is my fulfillment of a no more excuses promise i made with myself

3326114 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3326115 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3326116 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3326117 permanent joy for all of the little obit from sipp who knows whereof he speaks unlike most of us
3326118 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3326119 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3326120 sie war mit jemandem zusammen der sie nicht gut behandelt hat
3326121 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3326122 originally security wasnt built in it was a simpler time
3326123 the attack was a new virulent strain of an old attack it acts more quickly
3326124 a simple explanation is that its like playing russian roulette we need to figure out a way of taking the bullet out of the gun
3326125 dnssec is signed with a cryptographic key which is great for example com gives the signing key for co uk the question is who establishes the chain of trust the american government thinks it should but the chinese government disagrees
3326126 dnssec does provide security but people havent worked out the administration
3326127 on the political side the key issue is signing the route
3326128 you very quickly get into political territory frankly this is about updating the route by the internet assigned numbers authority iana and who should be responsible for creating and maintaining the route
3326129 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3326130 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3326131 you have to be prepared to get your head around the fact youre going to have less grouse around
3326132 ive got to live with what ive got im prepared to put the work in on maintaining the habitat because we can achieve a certain level of shooting but the point will come if we get any more hen harriers that the number of grouse will not warrant having a shoot here
3326133 lifestyles mean organizing gatherings and finding a suitable time can be complicated

3326135 in october obamas former pastor rev jeremiah wright will publish a new book and hit the road to promote it an occasion that might well place the topic of obamas blackness along with his patriotism and his candor about what he heard in the pews in all those years at trinity church squarely at the center of the national debate
3326136 has flattened off since april and oil prices have fallen back significantly over the last few weeks
3326137 so inflationary pressures from those sources should fall back markedly in due course
3326138 we were skeptical at first but any time one of your smaller competitors announces that its for sale its worth seeing whats there
3326139 and we discovered that theyd built a competitive but complementary business because theyd largely gone after a segment of the market that we werent targeting theres very little overlap within our client bases
3326140 there were some software components that were on our roadmap but we hadnt gotten to them yet
3326141 well be adding those in prior to migrating habeas clients to our platform
3326142 it is very disappointing data with widespread signs of higher price pressures
3326143 it will undoubtedly convince some members of the monetary policy committee to vote for higher rates but we doubt they will reach a majority
3326144 this market will definitely grow bigger there will be always be trade in assets
3326145 who will profit most from this that would be those making the investments rather than the investment banks advising on the deals
3326146 the u s subprime crisis slowed the stock market with trading this thin it will be difficult to achieve our initial target
3326147 as of now we have not heard of any plans that have been cancelled
3326148 if they do not build now they would miss their chance when market conditions improve
3326149 in the future smelters certainly will go for scale the smelter with larger capacity can survive better
3326150 huayin is not totally controlled by chalco it probably prefers to put more funds into its australian project
3326151 chalco may take the bauxite for its middle east project
3326152 smelters may not think of drafting new expansion plans right now amid high costs and low prices but once the market turns new capacity will be built and come onstream within months
3326153 we would hesitate before automatically extrapolating the recent price trend
3326154 with the btc currently closed disruption to georgian energy infrastructure further limits the possibility of getting caspian oil and gas to market
3326155 the persistent spirited craving we have for connection meaning relevance peace cant really be abandoned because from 8 to 5 we have a job can it more and more and more we see people bringing their humanity to work and finding ways to specify whats really important less is more seems to me the only time more is more is when its more of less

3326370 after an incredibly successful summer of music led activity we felt it was right to put the crowning event in the hands of a music fan to help us develop the gig of their dreams
3326371 the design and artist billing of the spectacular closing gig of the summer
3326372 a complete musical experience boasting a full stage and dj booth with sofas and demo stations inside for consumers to get their hands on the very latest music entertainment and games that xbox 360 offers

3326379 most of the proponents of the nexus legislation would concede that given this is an election year its unlikely the legislation will pass
3326380 golden state retailers would be at a competitive disadvantage to out of state companies
3326381 adopt a regulation subjecting digital property transfers to the sales and use tax law state and local revenues could increase by approximately 114 million annually
3326382 a series of related images which when shown in succession impart an impression of motion together with accompanying sounds if any
3326383 i suspect we will see the next 14 attempting to address it in the next legislative cycle
3326384 as these technologies meet there is this question of what is digital goods and what is software
3326385 to define where technology is today and how it should be taxed
3326386 provided that the non electronic version of that item was not exempt
3326387 the way our statute is currently we probably could tax them but we should probably have the legislature have the final say
3326388 the sale of digital music delivered electronically to customers for download on their computers constitutes the sale of intangible property and is not subject to sales or use tax
3326389 jullie zien parallel en weggaan van lineariteit als iets positiefs maar het enige wat ik zie is chaos

3326398 as far as i know hes the first politician since the civil war to recognize how deeply embedded slavery and race have been in our constitution
3326399 thats a profoundly important thing to say but whats important about the way he said it is he doesnt use this as a springboard for anger or for frustration he doesnt say o k slavery was bad therefore people are owed something this is not a reparations speech this is a speech about saying its time for the nation to do better to form a more perfect union
3326400 the idea that this nation is more than the sum of its parts that out of many we are truly one
3326401 for the men and women of reverend wrights generation the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away
3326402 nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years that anger may not get expressed in public in front of white co workers or white friends but it does find voice in the barbershop or around the kitchen table

3326404 race is an issue that i believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now

3326503 it was the one place that advertising hasnt been entrenched properly into the content itself
3326504 you look at every other example video tv and motion picture have done a great job of integrating advertisers and theres been a big value there but nothing in the music world made sense
3326505 it just makes sense right gas prices may go up but free still works thats not going to impact our fan bases decisions
3326506 the young artists intuit that if you have millions of people that think youre great youre going to make money somewhere

3326508 i actually think even the major labels are starting to wake up to the fact after seeing what nine inch nails could do or what radiohead could do theyre all kind of saying we need to partner with these people
3326509 we dont want to be the guys who are competing for the 99 cents its not our model

3326536 because of its complexity network access control technology is underutilized even though it offers organizations a stronger better way of protecting their data

3326561 these two patents enable users to click one button to contact another person and find that person no matter what device he or she is using or where he or she is
3326562 these two patents are significant to both the industry and avistar for two key reasons first they describe the use of real time text and audio not just video and they have a priority date of october 1993
3326563 second and this is noteworthy the patent and trademark office pto at our request thoroughly reviewed the prior art put forth by microsoft in their challenge of all 29 of avistars u s patents through the ptos re examination process earlier this year we feel that the ptos approval of these two patents together with their rejection of the re examination requests for 19 avistar patents and most of a 20th suggest a favorable outcome with regard to our other pending patents as well as the patents the pto has accepted for re examination

3326593 no one wants to cut their dividend because it is an open advertisement that you are having a cash flow problem
3326594 many companies are extremely proud of their dividend record they do no want to destroy their shareholders good will the stockholders that hold for the dividend are exactly the kind of shareholders you want
3326595 while financials traditionally pay out the most in dividends there are many other niches of this market where attractive yields can be found
3326596 investors are going to look back at some of these companies with high yields and think they should have scooped them up while they had the chance

3326598 ever since the arab nations surrounding israel encouraged palestinians to flee the nascent state of israel 60 years ago they have refused to permit them to settle and integrate into their populations preferring to see a united nations supported permanent refugee state of palestine fester on the israeli border and remain a canker in international relations
3326599 and that folks is all anyone expelled from his homeland would want right just to forget and move on as far away from his alleged homeland as possible right content that its gone to more deserving folk right

3326637 what you are about to see is one of the wonders of the ancient world created by men in the days when humans could perform magic wegnar was specially chosen by the elite of the magician kings to be the repository for an awesome magical force that was so long ago in the ancient past that no one can remember why or what the true purpose of the five gem coin is suffice it to say that the magician kings did not trust the safety of the five gem coin to the frailty of a mere keeper alone they constructed the special vault we are about to enter and then surrounded the vault with a ring of red stone
3326638 the ring of red kills the fairie dead that is what our children learn at their mothers knee and you can hear them singing it out in the streets of wegnar today a magic circle of lustrous stone that warns of anybody carrying weapons and will kill the dread fairie of legend stone cold dead our histories tell us that during the war with the fairie no less than four of them were found dead within the circle small they were less than a foot tall and with transparent wings on their backs that shone with all the colours of the rainbow they say there was not a mark on them and they looked as though they were sleeping i will point out the graves they were buried in as we pass them by the keeper of the time wished to show respect to avoid bringing down the wrath of the dread empress clea upon us all
3326639 they say the greatest prophet that ever lived or will live came to this very spot eight hundred years ago
3326640 they say he saw all the futures that might be and all that had ever happened in the past back to the dawn of time some claimed that he saw them all at once and that his gift had driven him mad what we do know for certain is what he told keeper daken the twelfth all those years ago
3326641 when the coin is stolen the keeper will be broken the chaos that will bring heralds the return of the high king
3326642 we believe this prophesy to mean that the loss of the coin will bring about the end of the world to be a high king you would need to be a magician king and they are all long dead only when the dead rise from their cold graves could the high kings of old return that is why each new keeper guards the coin so carefully and why we townsfolk watch over the keeper to make sure he does his job
3326643 before i take you down into the vault i shall explain how it is constructed and what steps our keeper takes to guard it the vault is thirty feet below ground and is carved from a single solid piece of rock after we have crossed the ring of red we will enter the first level of the vault this is a single room set six feet deep into the rock light enters the room through crystal pipes which i will tell you about later
3326644 the outer door to that first room is two foot thick stone and it is always kept locked it swings open and closed on great hinges made of a special metal that we have lost the making of many small holes cut through the rock provide air and allow the guards inside to hear what is happening outside two guards stand constant watch on the outside of the vault and will warn those inside if they are being attacked
3326645 from the first level there are steps leading down many feet to the coin level the vault is lit by many crystal pipes that direct sunlight from the outside deep into the outer corridors the pipes are made of solid unbreakable glass in the form of five sided tubes that bounce light down and through them
3326646 the maze can best be described as four concentric squares each one set one inside the other the door through each square reveals corridors going right and left and completely around the square inside when traversed these corridors lead to the next door which is always to be found on the farthest side the fourth square forms the coin room this room is not lit by crystal pipes as it is lit by the five gem coin itself which glows red eternally from the rubies set in it
3326647 now let us walk the path to the vault but can i warn any strangers among us that should you be of fairie kind you should turn back now before you walk to your doom
3326648 the surfaces of the pipes on the outside of the vault are cleaned and polished each day by the keepers servants
3326649 i want to you split into two groups when we reach the bottom alternate people going left and right down the corridors do not fear my friends both groups will meet again at the next doorway
3326650 please move right around the room when you go in the coin sits on a glass mount which itself sits on a large stone plinth you can walk right around the plinth to see the coin from all sides now marvel at the wonder and mystery that is the five gem coin
3326651 if you would all like to leave the room in an orderly manner
3326652 we are going to mount a raid on the steam dragon early tomorrow morning just before dawn

3326662 oh right the one where hitler creates his own ecoman robot or maybe march of the ecomen when ecoman recruited the boys of ecotropolis to form the ecoman corps
3326663 yeah from ecoman family 17 november 1958 or maybe a pigeon cries in ecotropolis from the ecoman amp black ecoman special winter 1975 you could play the african american sidekick as we bust up that drug house full of nuclear waste
3326664 and theres always beholdeth a dark one riseth from the astonishing ecoman 138 through 144 april october 1979 the saga of dark ecoman

3326673 england spanish her word i told her spain japan china and all over
3326674 lets launch these systems now and take the opportunity and harvest the return as early as possible
3326675 what we see here how our business feels the momentum we have from what we see we think we have a solid plan and its doable
3326676 capcom is extremely excited to work with grin to bring the world class franchise of
3326677 in the year since it came out its still showing itself to have innovated deeply in what it means to have a game on the internet
3326678 it has the party system the theatre theres forge which pre empted even littlebigplanet in allowing you to co operatively mess around with levels you can share pictures and levels nothing has ever put this into a consistent and coherent whole as well as halo 3 has
3326679 the game that pushed the creative culture forward the most in the past year
3326680 we think halo 3 presents a road map for the way online will be integrated into games from this point forward
3326681 its all relative but there is a real aspect of this that you cant put a price on and that is creativity
3326682 it heralded a rich creativity from the uk that resonated across the world continued through elite tomb raider singstar gta even apple have been strongly influenced by uk design
3326683 its pretty much unproven elsewhere australia has similar incentives and has nothing on the scale of canadas operations
3326684 i remember at acclaim one of the things we had to do was write a baseball game in teeside i dont know why wed think wed get it right but we didnt
3326685 in china even now theyre talking about the threat of vietnam when it comes to development
3326686 using a uk developed game to open up markets in france spain and other regions where theyre obviously having problems
3326687 the american placed it on the fact the market was once dominated by old home computers like the bbc micro
3326688 traditional revenue sources will not be sufficient to fund games development
3326689 especially as global retail sales will be 20 percent lower in 2011 than in 2008
3326690 reduction in force of a portion of the affected development team
3326691 we did it through hard work dedication and the whole team was part of it not only a few guys
3326692 it was the wrong thing at the time it was the wrong thing to do but you know what i support andy
3326693 i know the way he works i know how hard he works im glad he came out and said that
3326694 if i wanted to help the team as much as i can and as quick as i can to recuperate
3326695 it didnt even cross my mind to use those things for me those things dont exist
3326696 this is to help him have more control of his image and brand
3326697 as i embark on this new chapter in my career i know that i have found someone who has earned a lot of respect in the entertainment industry
3326698 i want to state clearly and without qualification i did not take steroids human growth hormone or any other banned substances at any time in my baseball career or in fact my entire life
3326699 those substances represent a dangerous and destructive shortcut that no athlete should ever take
3326700 i am disappointed that my 25 years in public life have apparently not earned me the benefit of the doubt but i understand that sen mitchells report has raised many serious questions
3326701 i plan to publicly answer all of those questions at the appropriate time in the appropriate way
3326702 where in the heck was chuck schumer and chuck grassley 15 years ago
3326703 its a really great program so please go to yahoo groups and join
3326704 on the face of it it might indicate earl or some of his high ranking supervisors are suggesting that its in their best interests to give
3326705 what is the meaning of life the universe and everything
3326706 dig a trench put some fertiliser in of a special variety then put the potatoes in which you have sourced from the local market then another layer of special fertiliser i e crap then topsoil then water well earth up as the shoots appear
3326707 it has also been found that gourd skins were used to replace missing parts of skulls back in the neolithic times as part of primitive surgery this is seen as evidence of prostheses that is artificial bones made of very fine gold sheet and gourd skins which were inserted in the skull under the skin or to cover the hole left by the operation citation needed the harder outer surface lends the gourd to a wide variety of creative appeals including carving pyrography sculpture basketry masks musical instruments and much more a steadily growing following has emerged in the united states and other western countries for gourd art and craft related purposes there are many different types of decorative gourds they include spoon gourds spoon bicolor orange warted and striped pear the spoon gourd ripens from the top to the bottom a baby spoon gourd is green and as it grows it changes color a yellow color overlaps the green and creates a two colored gourd for decorative purposes the harvester can cut the gourd from the plant early when it is still two colors white gourd juice is also a common beverage retailed in china and chinese outlets outside china it has a unique smokey taste
3326708 it is a shocking number but i still dont think it is the full cost
3326709 i dont think there have been any credible cost numbers for the iraq war there was so much money spent at the beginning of the war and nobody knows where it went
3326710 i wish i had this training when i was there before
3326711 it helps take away the enemys advantage on us i know what i am looking for now
3326712 we give them the ability to think like the enemy
3326713 we can now see if anybody has been there and if we are being tracked
3326714 you are never going to see the world the same
3326715 we can read body language now and i know what i am looking for
3326716 however anecdotal evidence and after action reports from commanders in theater say that this training is saving lives the measure of success right now is when a marine returns from a patrol convoy or standing a post and is excited that he used the combat hunter training
3326717 ive done it from scratch before and it takes a year and a half to get things going and can be quite painful
3326718 id been searching on businessesforsale com for about nine to 12 months and came across a number of businesses which i investigated and interviewed and for one reason or another were not suitable then i found montrose
3326719 it was a reputable business with an existing customer base and good customer case studies important for me as i wanted to avoid starting from scratch
3326720 i put an offer in quite quickly roughly at the asking price which was a six figure sum
3326721 it was a similar process to buying a property really we started just before december and the whole process was completed in mid march 2007
3326722 when you buy a house if there are a few cracks you can negotiate on the price so we changed the payment terms a little bit to give me some assurances
3326723 we have created v2 version two of the product and are just about to launch v3 in may 2008
3326724 like buying a house the first thing you do when you get in is redecorate
3326725 you are re gutting and putting in new equipment and then when its all done you have a housewarming
3326726 over the last 12 months i have built up the business
3326727 there are now 11 of us in total some part time some contracted in but all recruited personally and it is ticking over very nicely indeed
3326728 we aim to expand substantially and reach a turnover of 1m by 2010 we have just set up an american office and are working with the ukti uk trade amp investment to develop our brand in the us market
3326729 i dont think i got lucky i worked very hard and i also had close matches in the semi finals throughout the competition
3326730 its a wonderful feeling i am glad russia has finally won its first gold
3326731 we will need more evidence everyone in this situation needs a signed binding agreement
3326732 until that happens we are mobilized we are prepared for everything
3326733 i do appreciate it medvedevs gesture but there has been more damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties today
3326734 finally the international community began to speak with one voice and is beginning to get the message through that this behaviour is unacceptable
3326735 president saakashvili has signed the four point kouchner plan which is being discussed in moscow right now signing that would be a start
3326736 the international community must succeed in bringing a durable and proper end to this
3326737 in any case it is not a part of our political culture or foreign policy to topple anyone or put someone on a throne
3326738 we can hardly agree with this because it would assume the presence of people described as georgian peacekeepers they can no longer remain
3326739 they committed crimes and shot at comrades with whom they served in the same peacekeeping unit
3326740 not just holding negotiations with saakashvili but simply talking to him
3326741 but our general approach is that mr saakashvili can no longer be our partner it would be better if he went
3326742 this is an irresponsible stance when a great country is informed in this way about the position of the russian leadership
3326743 investigation into the allegation of theft looting or disappearance of priceless bini artifacts in the benin museum
3326744 what laws if not the constitution which is the supreme law of the land
3326745 i hate to imagine a vehicle plunging into these death traps
3326746 staying for a whole month without water is not a joke can they tell us when we will be getting some water
3326747 if not why are they being allowed to so blatantly flout traffic laws driving on kerbs jumping lights squeezing in between lanes and generally disobeying all conventions thus endangering their lives and those of other road users
3326748 if you have malaria youd better know everything there is to know about it
3326749 if the money is paid back to the government it could be used in other areas the money that the foreign missions spend is always captured in the budget and they should be responsible enough to pay into the federation account
3326750 it is very disturbing that we are not maintaining our embassy building due to non allocation of funds for regular maintenance since it was opened in 2003 the building has not witnessed any major maintenance work to keep it in shape to worsen matters we now have a chancery that we cannot proudly use to host diplomatic functions because of the state of the facilities we are always reluctant to host the monthly meetings of african diplomats here to save our face and national image diplomacy is not cheap
3326751 the strength of the structures should not be questioned as the pwd has confirmed they are strong
3326752 we are studying if carbon fibre used was strong enough according to specifications and if systems used had weaknesses and all these will take time
3326753 the umno headquarters has decided and allowed the aca to come in and investigate
3326754 i have also heard that there were many such stories
3326755 its pointless a leader who buys support is not a genuine leader
3326756 we want someone to be supported because of his capacity capability and his contributions towards the partys struggles money is not the yardstick and we should not make any mistake in this matter
3326757 this is an important matter decided by the umno supreme council its not a private arrangement between najib and i
3326758 sla is offering a number of vacant state properties for adaptive re use such as hotels and lifestyle attractions in line with the governments vision for changi point as an attractive and rustic seaview hotel resort and recreational destination
3326759 this latest property will add greater buzz and vibrancy to the changi area
3326760 a hotel development on the former changi camp site will provide an ideal alternative for visitors who prefer staying in a rustic environment
3326761 in the united states for example the industries work very well with universities and they sometimes even share facilities we think this is one area that we can develop because changi business park is a growing area and if we build a university there there are opportunities for industry to have linkages
3326762 we hope we have somebody named maybe by early next year certainly by the end of the first half
3326763 for competitions like beach volleyball and basketball spectators have one ticket for the whole afternoon morning evening
3326764 they may choose to go to one of them but not all them
3326765 if they find that there are not enough people or if they find that there are too many empty seats they organize some cheerleaders
3326766 a formal sale offer has been signed with a university in shanghai
3326767 we would be increasing our headcount from 37 000 to 50 000 in the next five years and set up more centres most of our business would be focused on the third party solutions and a little bit on the captive sector
3326768 in the last quarter we made 10 acquisitions globally and there is lot of scope for replicating it in the country
3326769 if we go for acquisitions it would be for increasing our capability and delivery network and not for merely increasing our scales
3326770 in the future we are looking at all emerging sectors including telecom retails fmcg for providing support with our bpo network in addition we are also seeking to tap the opportunities in sales support finance and accounting and supply chain management
3326771 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus both the fungus and the birds eat chilies but the fungus never disperses seeds it just kills them
3326772 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3326773 having such a specific defense one that doesnt harm reproduction or dispersal is what makes chemistry so valuable to the plant and it is a great example of the power of natural selection
3326774 you cannot ask a rahul dravid sachin tendulkar sourav ganguly vvs laxman or anil kumble to prove their credentials
3326775 i think you should ask the selectors and the bcci this question i am happy with whatever they have in mind
3326776 i think it is just with time we should start winning in odis consistently we are a great team and we start doing well pretty soon
3326777 australia as a team is still far ahead yes we can beat australia and we have proved that but to do it consistently we have to improve a lot i think once we become more consistent we can think of being number one
3326778 everyone has to improve we have got good bowlers in the side and they are doing their best
3326779 not at all a player can be good in odis and tests and 20 20 as well look at virender sehwag or gautam gambhir

3326781 results havent gone the way i or the club would have liked i feel its the right time to stand aside and give them time to find someone else
3326782 you get driven by results but they havent been good enough this year we havent done all the disciplines well enough particularly our batting and catching
3326783 things havent gone to plan with overseas signings shane bond had a few injuries shane watson had to pull out a week or so before he was due here but weve been lucky with our current one imran tahir
3326784 but im of the belief that if you rely on your overseas players then youre not going to be a particularly strong squad
3326785 what happened at that school constitutes race discrimination under federal anti discrimination laws that is why it is important that needs to be stopped
3326786 the problem public schools have is that it is a first amendment issue so public schools havent been very successful
3326787 this is not a case that implicates constitutional or statutory rights as no court has recognized a right to speak a foreign language at school
3326788 what happened at that school constitutes race discrimination under federal anti discrimination laws that is why it is important that needs to be stopped
3326789 the problem public schools have is that it is a first amendment issue so public schools havent been very successful

3326791 they are very young very nervous very frightened about the whole thing
3326792 we actually took them over to the courthouse and to the courtroom last week so they can sit in the witness chair and have a microphone in front of them and sort of get an idea of what this is going to be like it is very very frightening for them
3326793 that is definitely in the back of our minds its the ultimate goal getting softball put back into the lineup for 2016
3326794 i feel and we all feel that softball should be an olympic sport
3326795 i dont know how much these games are going to matter in helping to make that determination but hopefully we can play the game at the highest level make an impression and spread the word about the high level that we play and also spread the knowledge around the world that we need to continue to grow fast pitch softball
3326796 any olympics in general we are going to try to come out and put down our best performance
3326797 but there probably is a desire to really put a stamp on this one we know that its the last olympics for softball at least for now
3326798 this is definitely my last olympics and wed like to give everyone something to really remember
3326799 we showed everybody the heart and soul of this team

3326810 were just kind of letting them roll and were going to let them do that a couple of more days
3326811 and i think by around friday were going to have to say were looking for seven receivers and four running backs and then the rest of them thats just the way it is and theyre going to have to watch a little bit
3326812 i only played receiver two years in my whole life im like a natural running back as a receiver there are things i have to think about while im running running back just comes natural i dont have to think about that i just react

3326816 ive always felt like we have the best fans in the nfl and that they would support our team regardless of how they feel about myself or brett or management or whatever
3326817 but it was a great reception when we took the field
3326818 its been an interesting last month but i think our team has gotten pretty tight
3326819 the support from our teammates throughout the day today was definitely encouraging

3326838 just as dubious is the siren call for more initiatives one of the greatest mistakes in government is to confuse activity with outcomes just because ministers feel busy devising 101 new ways of tackling a problem does not guarantee the problem gets solved instead the public grow cynical as government rhetoric becomes increasingly divorced from reality while practitioners grow exasperated to implement yet another initiative often before the previous one has even been evaluated

3326861 at 19 years 15 percent of runners had died compared with 34 percent of controls
3326862 both common sense and background science support the idea that there is nothing magical about running per se
3326863 it is the regular physical vigorous activity that is important
3326864 over time all groups decreased running activity but the runners groups continued to accumulate more minutes per week of vigorous activity of all kinds
3326865 members of the running groups had significantly lower mean disability levels at all time points
3326866 almost all of them did something else they continued their vigorous exercise

3326889 over the last two weeks how often have you been bothered by the following problem thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way
3326890 it is worrying that despite improvements in cancer care a substantial number of patients feel they would be better off dead
3326891 we know that depression is common in patients who have cancer but it is often missed pain is also a big problem treating patients symptoms as well as their disease might improve and even save their lives
3326892 it is normal to experience distress after a cancer diagnosis but for some patients emotional distress or depression becomes a problem in itself and may lead to suicidal thoughts cancer specialists and gps can provide treatment with the help of psychiatrists if necessary

3326906 russias aggression against georgia is both a matter of urgent moral and strategic importance to the united states the implications go beyond their threat to a democratic georgia russia is using violence against georgia in part to intimidate other neighbors such as ukraine for choosing to associate with the west
3326907 the poles are spreading lies and the western press is mouthing their lies
3326908 it is realized that the league is incapable of rendering material aid and that the moral influence which may be a powerful force with civilized countries is unlikely to make any impression upon soviet russia
3326909 mocks mr putins dream of eventually restoring russian hegemony over eastern europe
3326910 former kgb lt colonel and current russian strong man vladimir putin seeks to regain the power and greatness russia had before the fall of the soviet union
3326911 they have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas
3326912 we can do that we can have a vote on that

3326916 ive got e mails from customers telling me that they really love the app
3326917 la boca sana de los humanos es el hogar de una gran variedad de microbios entre los que se encuentran virus hongos protozoos y bacterias
3326918 las bacterias son las m s numerosas ya que existen 100 millones en cada mil metro de saliva as como m s de 600 especies distintas en la boca
3326919 sorprendentemente esta especie estaba aislada del interior de los tejidos bucales lo que confirma que puede invadir tanto el tejido sano como el cancer geno y c lulas individuales
3326920 to be very careful and sensitive these days the russians are selling many arms to iran and syria and there is no need to offer them an excuse to sell even more advanced weapons
3326921 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
3326922 these mortgage exposures could be adversely affected byworsening market conditions further deterioration in thehousing market and market activity reflecting distressedsellers
3326923 the result is likely to be weaker than expected earnings
3326924 according to our estimates this would amount to 25 percentof daily turnover
3326925 the deteriorating economic outlook for the euro zone andelsewhere is now having an impact after the market had becomeused to weakness in the u s economy
3326926 this is another exciting development for tesco it complements our entries into china and the united states giving us access to another of the most important economies in the world our wholesale cash and carry format will bring improved value range and service to thousands of indian businesses
3326927 their tescos wholesale cash and carry business will provide us with the opportunity to tap into a world class supply chain thereby delivering the best of products and services to our customers
3326928 as tickets are really hard to get the fact that some of the best seats remained untaken through the whole game really upset people who really want to see the game but dont have the ticket
3326929 sponsors may give their tickets to their friends and important customers and they may not appreciate as much and come to the preliminaries
3326930 we are trying to persuade people to respect their rights to watch the games
3326931 oil demand data are coming in weaker on an underlying trend basis
3326932 this only reinforces the view that high prices are beginning to play a central role in determining demand at least for the oecd countries
3326933 remains high by any measure sustaining inflationary concerns not least in developing importer countries
3326934 while oecd demand could still surprise us on the downside non oecd prospects particularly for china and the middle east gulf could be subject to upside adjustment
3326935 add in customarily ever changing sentiment over iran and it looks too early to cite definitively a sea change in the market
3326936 you could go with this or you could go with that or yu could go with us
3326937 the conscious and intelligent maniplulation of organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in a democratic society those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power in our country we are governed our minds are molded our tastes formed our ideas suggested largely by men we have never heard of we are dominated by a relatively small number of persons it is they who pull the wires which control the public mind and who harness social forces and contrive new ways to bind and guide the world
3326938 the sick individual finds himself at home with all other similarly sick individuals the whole culture is geared to this kind of pathology the result is that the average individual does not experience the separateness and isolation the fully schizophrenic person feels he feels at ease among those suffer from the same deformation in fact it is the fully sane person who feels isolated int he insane society and he may suffer so much from the incapacity to communicate that it is he who may become psychotic
3326939 when in group narcissism the object is not the individual but he group to which he belongs
3326940 the larger a society or confederacy the greater the amalgamation of collective factors which is typical of every large organization the more aggraveted the moral and spiritual degeneration of the individual
3326941 that will be 12 99 and youve got something on your busoms there

3326949 we are absolutely thrilled that george martin has been selected as a regional winner and finalist in the community and heritage awards he has entertained literally thousands of visitors with his recollections over the years and has enthralled many school groups he nearly gave his life in service of his country and has continued to give of himself over a lifetime we wish him every success and hope he may become a national winner he certainly deserves it
3326950 we knew they were going to go crack heads we told them again and again not to do this
3326951 we thought we had an understanding with the russians that any response would be south ossetia focused clearly its not
3326952 i would say that we mostly were focused elsewhere unlike during the cold war when wed see a single soviet armor battalion move so yes the size and scope of the russian move has come as something of a surprise
3326953 statistically mississippi often appears last when ranked with the other states however the numbers do not reveal the signi ah now we know why nmc is back
3326954 ive decided to finish the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace the safety of our peacekeeping forces and civilian population has been restored the aggressor has been punished having sustained considerable losses its armed forces have been disorganised
3326955 russian shares slumped to a 22 month low and the ruble fell the most in more than three years on aug 8 as the country sent tanks troops and warplanes into georgia in what it said was a response to an offensive on south ossetia
3326956 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3326957 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3326958 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3326959 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3326960 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3326961 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3326962 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3326963 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3326964 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3326965 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3326966 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3326967 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3326968 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3326969 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3326970 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3326971 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3326972 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3326973 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3326974 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3326975 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3326976 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3326977 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3326978 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3326979 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3326980 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3326981 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3326982 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3326983 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3326984 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3326985 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3326986 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3326987 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3326988 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3326989 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3326990 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3326991 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3326992 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3326993 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3326994 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3326995 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3326996 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3326997 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3326998 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3326999 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3327000 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

3327012 one of the best network log analysis tools that weve seen logrhythm contains all the features youd expect in a sim plus the ones you need for managing log evidence
3327013 it was virtually impossible to look at the log data across all devices and correlate events until we implemented logrhythm logrhythm automates all of those functions for us and generates the reports necessary for us to meet pci compliance requirements
3327014 our iseries systems are no longer an island nbsp the logrhythm powertech solution enables us to meet pci dss requirements more efficiently while enhancing our overall it security effectiveness
3327015 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3327016 one is the sophisticated coordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3327017 with the commencement of the deliveries of our newbuild vessels eagle bulk is now on a rapid expansion phase which will see significantly enhanced growth in cashflow and earnings

3327026 i think were going to try and be a bit more strategic about which ones we bring back to life but well continue to do it
3327027 we are delighted that steve will be joining woolworths with his strong background in both retail and consultancy together with his particular experience in achieving a turnaround at focus he brings the strategic and operational skills that the group needs to help it move to the next stage of its development
3327028 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3327029 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3327030 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3327031 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3327032 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3327033 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3327034 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3327035 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3327036 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3327037 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3327038 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3327039 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3327040 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3327041 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3327042 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3327043 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3327044 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3327045 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3327046 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3327047 i think i should look into what the catholics say
3327048 i was looking around at all sorts of christian groups when i just happened to read an article or book or blog or about catholicism and i thought that it made sense then i read more and more and it all began making sense
3327049 why doesnt he the archbishop of canterbury say that this is what needs to happen this is what we believe and that is not we need a strong leader with authority
3327050 where do i see a church speaking into the culture and challenging that culture
3327051 seven to eight plainclothes officers who beat me and dragged me and my brother hua huilin into two separate cars
3327052 they asked me why i was going to kuanjie protestant church to worship and threatened me saying you are not allowed to go because president bush is going there today
3327053 after about four or five hours when i saw that the people who were watching me had all fallen asleep i fled but im afraid to go home
3327054 i havent heard from him weve been waiting here were so worried
3327055 my father asks me every day where he is and i tell him i dont know
3327056 tu sais jai pens quon pourrait aussi faire ca blabla bla et tu sais pour le disco on pourrait prendre ca en costumes blablabla bla
3327057 the study has a very pro exercise message if you had to pick one thing to make people healthier as they age it would be aerobic exercise
3327058 the health benefits of exercise are greater than we thought
3327059 this research re confirms the clear benefits of regular exercise for older people
3327060 exercise can help older people to stay mobile and independent ensure a healthy heart keep weight and stress levels under control and promote better sleep
3327061 the agency allowed more than 10 000 people with criminal backgrounds to sell home loans in florida including bank robbers racketeers and cocaine traffickers
3327062 more than 4 000 of those passed ofr background checks despite criminal records with most committing crimes that state law specifically required the agency to screen fraud dishonest dealing and crimes of moral turpitude
3327063 florida now has the highest mortgage fraud rate in the nation
3327064 attorney general bill mccollum said he doesnt think barring people with prior financial crimes goes far enough
3327065 he noted that scott almeida a mortgage broker highlighted in
3327066 repeatedly refused to press for the licensing of loan originators
3327067 there is a huge question mark as to why none of this was brought up before when it really mattered said house minority leader dan gelber d miami beach

3327081 ok maillot duato kylian forshyte et je fais ma sauce
3327082 i think theres a perception these compounds hold untapped potential to help us understand the human mind
3327083 the working hypothesis is that if psilocybin or lsd can occasion these experiences of great personal meaning and spiritual significance then it would allow patients with terminal illnesses hopefully to face their own demise completely differently to restructure some of the psychological angst that so often occurs concurrently with severe disease
3327084 pamela had lost hope she wasnt able to make plans for the future she wasnt able to engage the day as if she had a future left
3327085 investigators need to be confident that the volunteer could not exit the window if in a delusional state
3327086 the way i view it is we experienced some kind of broad cultural trauma back in the 60s and these drugs became demonised in that context
3327087 as a culture we just decided clinical research shouldnt be done with this class of compounds
3327088 this was partly the federal regulatory authorities it was partly the funding agencies and it was partly the academics themselves leary had so discredited a scientific approach to studying these compounds that anyone who expressed an interest in doing so was automatically discredited
3327089 these drugs these experiences are not for the mystic who wants to sit on the mountain top and meditate they are not for the counter culture rebel they are for everybody
3327090 as the session began and as it built up i felt this lump of emotions welling up and firming up almost like an entity i started to cry a little then it started to dissipate and i started to look at it differently and i think that is the beauty of being able to expand your consciousness i dont think the drug is the cause of these things i think it is a catalyst that allows you to release your own thoughts and feelings from some place that you have bound them to very tightly i began to realise that all of this negative fear and the guilt was such a hindrance to making the most of and enjoying the healthy time that im having however long it may be i was not utilising it to the best and enjoying my life because i was so afraid of what wasnt there yet these substances occur in our natural world and people have been using them for thousands of years to treat physical illness to treat social and behavioural problems
3327091 this is so they get more energy going into the trunk and less into unwanted branches
3327092 in agriculture you might be able to avoid pruning by spraying the crop with this compound or using this compound to discover a more active one that could be applied to that species
3327093 its probably the case that were just starting to chip away at these sort of signalling molecules
3327094 finding another one is important to understanding how to find them and what they do and how they all interact
3327095 nearly 80 of plants that you dig up have got this relationship down in their roots with these fungi and that enhances their ability to take up nutrients
3327096 in australia that is important because we have really bad soil and the plants have to work hard to get water or nutrients out of the soil
3327097 this discovery is providing the biosynthetic genes for the compound thats needed to enhance the nutrient water uptake
3327098 we have a concern about his privatizing his work as governor if hes doing the states business then the public should be following what hes doing
3327099 out of an abundance of concern for taxpayers he chose to pay for all of his phone calls himself that way there is no way taxpayers pick up the tab
3327100 could that be any less public i dont think so
3327101 a witness saw him stabbing her five or six times
3327102 it was outside on the yard we got the call around 2 55 p m
3327103 he lives in a house near the stabbing scene and they think he had a change of clothes

3327136 once again it is with great pleasure that we announce to our shareholders and the market the excellent results ccr obtained in the 2q08
3327137 organic traffic growth in the first half of 2008 shows that ccr continues benefiting from brazils positive economic scenario with consistent growth of traffic volume in all our business units
3327138 in june 2008 we formally and legally concluded two important agreements that will allow the qualified growth of the ccr group in addition to creating value to shareholders the mario covas ring road west segment concession agreement and the acquisition of 40 of renovias
3327139 mario covas ring road west segment represents one of the main solutions for traffic in the metropolitan region in addition to presenting full synergy with the companys business since it is connected to the highways managed by autoban and viaoeste
3327140 in order to remain in the forefront of best corporate practices ccr continues to seek pioneering initiatives to adjust its management and competitiveness within the new business context fine tuning the structures of each business unit simplifying its processes and recognizing the value of its employees
3327141 finally we remain very confident in the opportunities that brazils infrastructure environment can offer to the company in the short and long terms always focused on capital discipline and the creation of shareholder value ccr is positioning itself in several new projects that may result in infrastructure solutions and investments contributing to the social and economical development of the involved areas
3327142 automation solutions are the only practical way to reduce the high costs of maintaining complex sap systems and we designed our livecompare intelligent impact analysis technology to meet that demand
3327143 our product strategy provides a pure software solution built on a flexible easy to implement intuitive platform that guarantees immediate results
3327144 in many sap change management scenarios a key challenge for sap operations teams is simply to understand the full impact of that change across a live application landscape
3327145 change is the one constant with sap intelligent impact analysis technology makes it possible to automatically answer the most fundamental operational sap questions including those about what has changed and the impact of that change
3327146 because of its complexity network access control technology is underutilized even though it offers organizations a stronger better way of protecting their data
3327147 verizon business has the experience and expertise to educate businesses about this technology and enable them to use it effectively
3327148 the network access control market has taken off more slowly than expected because of the overall complexity of engagements and the general immaturity of products in the market the adoption of professional services focused on nac engagements product evaluations to determine the right fit for each customers use cases and the option of adopting managed services such as those offered by verizon business will accelerate the maturation of the nac market and will create additional peace of mind for organizations adopting the technology

3327155 each accelerator will showcase how the microsoft dynamics crm 4 0 platform can be configured and extended to broaden marketing sales and service capabilities
3327156 they are building out functionality that our partners and clients have been asking for
3327157 for instance the e service accelerator allows user to integrate crm cases into a web site and set up a workflow for these cases the sales methodology accelerator provides integration for leading firms like miller heiman
3327158 content marketing in my definition is the ability to produce useful and entertaining information that is worthwhile on its own but that might also be useful towards a sale or subsequent action traditional marketing efforts the slick and shiny kind are like red licorice
3327159 but what if instead you wrote up some really great suggestions for how one might do that certain job better with or without your product and then made a very simple link back to whatever your product offer might be which would offer more value to your prospective customer
3327160 slower yes more effort yes but i believe the results will speak for themselves
3327161 you will start to accumulate relationships with people who actually care about the space where your company is doing business and might actually benefit from your product service
3327162 it allows you to compare search volume patterns and trends across specific geographic regions categories like finance health and sports and time frames
3327163 a lot of people hoping that somehow the social network will be the answer to increasing revenues attendance bottom line profitability its a good thing to do certainly but most marketers who are doing it as a grassroots effort are going to hit some very serious walls very quickly
3327164 one late 2002 study showed that between 40 and 50 percent of all crm software licenses purchased end up going unused within 12 months
3327165 yet time and again when companies would struggle it usually came down to one or more of three core factors technology processes and people with people being by leaps and bounds the most important element

3327181 we believe that our answers are best understood in the context of broader industry practices as are many issues relating to online advertising
3327182 concerns about online advertising and its privacy implications cannot be solved by one company alone or by focusing solely on advertising practices moreover both technologies and best practices for protecting privacy are changing rapidly and this dynamism should be taken into account by policy makers as you examine this space

3327194 we didnt want to let them stick around we wanted to let the crowd know that we were ready to play you dont want to play around with teams if you have a chance to make a statement and put them away early you do that

3327200 in this time when many important issues face our nation it is vital that we have representation in congress that can effectively lead on issues including energy independence and national security
3327201 it has come to our attention that there may have been some outside groups who sought to improperly influence the republican primary the republican voters of the first congressional district know that this congressional seat is too important to do anything but look at this very closely my campaign believes we should take an opportunity to explore all of the factual information and options
3327202 alright pacman is here this is going to be awesome
3327203 i struggled until i took a chance mixed my operatic style with pop in purple rain and realised my dreams

3327206 last thursday in your palace we discussed the damaging consequences of recent legal procedures against jewish partisans
3327207 mr president if ever there was a time for your statement it is now not only to condemn this attack and severely punish its organisers and agents it is time to validate the heroes of the anti nazi resistance and integrate their chapter into the historical narrative of all lithuanians
3327208 if they would give their expertise in a historical investigation that would be welcome
3327209 sadly to date the public outcry has yet to yield a fair and reasonable lithuanian response
3327210 in light of this severe and continuing problem yad vashem calls upon you to intervene directly and restore lithuanias integrity as an enlightened and democratic nation by ending the misguided investigations only by dealing openly and forthrightly with the full and complex truth about the past will your nation succeed in building for itself a secure and stable future

3327217 indonesian corruptors are shameless they get their names and deeds splashed in the press all the time and no one cares
3327218 the only thing that works in fighting corruption is consistent non political prosecutions and jail time starting at the very top
3327219 when you are in a hole stop digging this simple familiar advice might appear very apt for the labour party at this moment in time
3327220 so what types of digging needs to stop first is the frantic search for some magic populist policy solution
3327221 there is no single get out of jail card and it is foolish to believe that such simplistic solutions will do the trick indeed some are counter productive inviting the publics contempt by implying a desperation to buy support by ditching unpopular taxes or offering dubious incentives
3327222 just as dubious is the siren call for more initiatives
3327223 one of the greatest mistakes in government is to confuse activity with outcomes just because ministers feel busy devising 101 new ways of tackling a problem does not guarantee the problem gets solved
3327224 instead the public grow cynical as government rhetoric becomes increasingly divorced from reality while practitioners grow exasperated to implement yet another initiative often before the previous one has even been evaluated

3327238 they allow the secretary of state to remove a case from a jury on the vague ground that it is in the public interest the whole thing is an appalling violation of the separation of powers
3327239 the government has so far failed to make the case for handing it the power to appoint the coroner disband the jury and hold inquests in secret

3327244 a digital download is the greenest way to buy music movies and software since it requires no driving to the store no delivery vans and no plastics or packaging
3327245 the retail sale lease licensing or use of specified digital products transferred to or accessed by subscribers or consumers
3327246 sales of digital audio works music digital audiovisual works movies music videos tv shows and digital books
3327247 most of the proponents of the nexus legislation would concede that given this is an election year its unlikely the legislation will pass
3327248 golden state retailers would be at a competitive disadvantage to out of state companies
3327249 adopt a regulation subjecting digital property transfers to the sales and use tax law state and local revenues could increase by approximately 114 million annually
3327250 a series of related images which when shown in succession impart an impression of motion together with accompanying sounds if any
3327251 i suspect we will see the next 14 attempting to address it in the next legislative cycle
3327252 as these technologies meet there is this question of what is digital goods and what is software
3327253 to define where technology is today and how it should be taxed
3327254 provided that the non electronic version of that item was not exempt
3327255 the way our statute is currently we probably could tax them but we should probably have the legislature have the final say
3327256 the sale of digital music delivered electronically to customers for download on their computers constitutes the sale of intangible property and is not subject to sales or use tax
3327257 i wouldve been hard pressed to come up with an example where electronic wedding invitations would be acceptable except when real life intervenes
3327258 in the past i never would have thought to use an electronic invitation because i dont know if it was as much of a formality as it was about brand awareness and being so protective over how the brand was portrayed
3327259 people always wanted to speak to the hostess when they made a reservation at a restaurant now they just use opentable
3327260 there was a whole segment of event types that people just did not want to use electronic invitations for
3327261 id like to believe that because of how we do things you also get the aesthetic aspect of it you dont have to sacrifice it
3327262 not having to use paper is huge when youre trying to be eco conscious
3327263 its better for the environment its cheaper if not free and youre collecting the majority of your rsvps in a place where theres no human error people either hit yes no or maybe and itll download into a list
3327264 there are always ways to do paper invitations in a cost effective way
3327265 you can get paper print them yourself hand write them
3327266 that point is actually quite well taken because it does create quite a lot of paper waste what might be interesting is to see if there are people or companies that come up with very low impact ways of generating invitations that are either easily recyclable or directly reusable
3327267 if you really know your guests and you really know its a preference for them i think thats great
3327268 at new york fashion week youve got 12 days of shows and events and its highly highly competitive
3327269 if you dont send out a paper invitation it doesnt work theres something about it landing on someones desk and having it be tactile
3327270 a large not quite a quarter yet but about 20 percent of our events are actually wedding related

3327280 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3327281 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3327282 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3327283 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3327284 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3327285 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3327286 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3327287 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation

3327295 de meeste sprookjes zijn normbevestigend en ze hadden veel kinderen en leefden lang en gelukkig saai en opvoedkundig verantwoord de slechten verliezen altijd en niet altijd even realistisch aan dit laatste kan je weinig doen een sprookje is nu eenmaal een vastgeroeste genre zoals een aktiefilm een thriller of een opera met standaard ingredi nten maar de schrijver heeft de andere beperkingen handig omzeild het verschil tussen goed en kwaad vervaagt kinderen kweken hoeft niet meer de prinses leefde lang ongelukkig en kinderloos want de prins doet het met zijn lijfwacht en er wordt niet nagelaten de wel bijzondere anatomie van de mooie gebruinde gespierde tot in de meest intieme details te onthullen onthullingen zijn het eigenlijk ook niet die strakke middeleeuwse broeken hadden toch bepaalde voordelen dat onze unisex kleding niet meer heeft je kon moeiteloos de beschikbare waren keuren met kleine teugen te genieten iedere dag n verhaal voor het slapengaan alhoewel er van slapen in de komende uur uren geen sprake meer zal zijn

3327311 i concede with sorrow that the baseless fanaticism of our people is in part to be blamed for the awakening of arab distrust i can raise no sympathy at all for the misdirected piety which transforms a piece of a herodian wall into a national relic thereby offending the feelings of the natives
3327312 in the short term it is business as usual we dont rely on dr thaksins money
3327313 when mark hughes makes a decision we go through the normal process which can include banks finance or a whole bunch of different things just like any other club
3327314 he is willing to look at whatever it takes to make city a great football club
3327315 i gave him an update on the club and we talked about new player acquisitions
3327316 we also talked over dinner about why he had bought the club and his intentions it was really clear he wants to be at this football club for the next 10 years
3327317 he wants to build a dynasty and he was disappointed that people think he wanted to get in and back out
3327318 this is not the dream package sold to mark the club is falling apart and nobody knows how much longer shinawatra will hang around
3327319 we are concerned about the fact we do not have full stadia
3327320 we think it is due to the weather the humidity and then the rain and on the first couple of days there were not many spectators who showed up
3327321 if local venue managers find there are not enough people in the venue or too many empty seats they arrange for local volunteers as cheerleaders
3327322 they are told to cheer for both teams to create a better atmosphere if the ticket holders turn up then they get up and go
3327323 there are also reserved seats for the olympic family that have not been taken up the preliminary rounds are sometimes not attended and people at other events have tickets for the whole day and do not attend the every event

3327325 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make
3327326 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap
3327327 but in the end the director thought her image was not the most appropriate because she was a little too old regrettably we had to let her go
3327328 the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression in the matter of her voice yang peiyi was flawless in the unanimous opinion of all the members of the team
3327329 we have a responsibility to face the audience of the whole country and to be open with this explanation
3327330 we should all understand it like this it is a question of the national interest it is a question of the image of our national music our national culture
3327331 especially at the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important an extremely serious matter
3327332 so we made the choice i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi after all we have a perfect voice a perfect image and a perfect show in our teams view all together

3327345 japan showed similar developments to europe while demand in the u s remained weak the emerging markets continued to grow strongly
3327346 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3327347 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation

3327380 dont go for looks for looks can be deceiving dont go for wealth for wealth can be lost go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright find the one that makes your heart smile
3327381 love begins with a smile and it grows with a kiss
3327382 maybe we were meant to meet the wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person we will know how to be grateful for that gift
3327383 maybe when the door of happiness closes another opens but often times we look so long at the closed door that we dont see the one which has been opened for us
3327384 maybe the best kind of friend is one you can sit with on a porch swing for hours not saying a word then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you ever had
3327385 maybe it is true that we dont know what weve got until we lose it but maybe it is also true that we dont know what weve been missing until it arrives
3327386 there are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them in real life dream what you want to dream go where you want to go be what you want to be because you have but only one chance to do all the things you want to do in this life
3327387 in life may you have enough happiness to make you sweet enough trials to make you strong enough sorrow to keep you human and enough hope to make you happy

3327412 i have been very disappointed by the approach to mikey the blind housemate on big brother and the blindfolded task they did there
3327413 this was an opportunity to make a real difference but unfortunately i think it descended into farce
3327414 mikey is not being encouraged to be as independent as possible that is what blind people want and deserve and what we at beacon centre aim to promote
3327415 our sponsored blindfold will be a fun initiative but with a serious message and nothing like the goings on in the big brother house
3327416 we have to make sure that all goes ahead as safely as possible that said we are determined to make this as challenging and worthwhile event as it can be and we are very much looking forward to ensuring its as big a success as possible
3327417 its not every day our guests get the chance to experience something like this from checking in to eating dinner as a blind person and i hope people will show beacon centre their support by taking part

3327490 john was first diagnosed with diabetes in 1990 and despite warnings about his high blood pressure and cholesterol levels continued to smoke drink too much eat unhealthy takeaways and not monitor his blood glucose levels properly
3327491 as a result john lost most of his vision from diabetic retinopathy within three months in 2000 he went completely blind a year later
3327492 from day one i struggled to find specialist diabetes care for john there was no care group in my area until 2003 and it was only after i became a committee member of a new local group that i found out about the dangers of diabetes and what services were available
3327493 diabetes specialist nurses were also under funded and in short supply where we lived it was only through a personal contact that i managed to find one
3327494 even after john died i had to persuade the coroner to register diabetes as a secondary cause on his death certificate he explained that as the condition was not the direct cause of death it wasnt usually recorded
3327495 there needs to be better public awareness about the seriousness of diabetes and better access to care for people with the condition no one should have to go through what my family and i have
3327496 if someone was giving you crap what would you do
3327497 i would ignore them and walk away because it is the easiest and most diplomatic thing to do
3327498 its just a feeling that we have we dont like to talk about it because it hurts us
3327499 geez i wish i wasnt losing my house right now so if im making a profit somehow its not doing me a lot of good
3327500 can we be wrong yes but were doing more than sitting around talking about someone missing
3327501 if it comes out that theyre close it could bring harm to caylee
3327502 she wants to see her family talk to her family but shes willing to sacrifice that for caylee
3327503 shes very in tune to whats going on legally shes a bright woman
3327504 just to get some information from the search department to see how the search is going for our granddaughter
3327505 its just a question and answer period for both of us we have some questions for them this is going to be an ongoing thing we do with them until our granddaughter comes home
3327506 we had a long conversation about that today some of the stuff that got leaked out is erroneous and theyre looking at some of those things today
3327507 how did the person who had caylee get your mothers phone number
3327508 if she cared to talk with us and tell us what she knew wed certainly sit down and listen to her
3327509 smells like theres been a dead body in the damn car
3327510 the officer indicated he was unaware it was in his lunch pail or lunch bucket and we believed him
3327511 it was something that was supposed to go ahead and catch an incident someone bringing in something maybe it was a mistake or he may have been trying to do something wrong we dont know
3327512 because of the lack of understanding and sheer embarrassment of my condition and prolonged periods of absence due to the illness i left school with no qualifications
3327513 it wasnt until i was diagnosed years later with crohns disease and underwent surgery an ileostomy that i was able to return to study go to night school for four years passing a levels and go to university in later life after raising a family
3327514 when i was at school from the late 1950s onwards little was known about the condition now understood to be crohns disease as my condition involved up to 30 visits to the toilet a day teachers and even my gp at the time put it down to a nervous temperament
3327515 fortunately medical understanding and healthcare provision for crohns disease and indeed inflammatory bowel disease ibd in general has moved on considerably organisations such as the ileostomy and internal pouch group offer support to those who have undergone or are about to undergo surgery
3327516 the before and aftercare delivered to people in the community or at hospitals via specialist stoma care nurses has improved vastly over the years
3327517 companies such as fittleworth which provides a service delivering stoma care products to those who have undergone surgery and other stoma related needs work hand in hand with the nhs providing additional support for ibd sufferers in the form of specialist stoma nurses who can advise those who opt for surgery in the lead up and immediate aftermath of the operation
3327518 not all people suffer symptoms acute enough to justify surgery having part of your body removed is always going to be quite drastic and the objective of the ongoing research is to ultimately enable more people to manage the condition without surgery and find a cure
3327519 as an organisation we support people who are facing the prospect of surgery and in the early days following surgery we promote awareness generally of what an ileostomy is
3327520 we often get enquiries from people wanting to travel abroad and before the increase of security measures at airports following 9 11 we were able to provide them with a certificate which meant they didnt have to go through the embarrassment of having their luggage searched and stoma products being produced
3327521 that is now no longer possible but fittleworth provide an international service which means stoma products can be delivered and visits from stomacare specialists arranged abroad using international partner companies through fittleworths world assist alliance service
3327522 bowel matters or continence matters are becoming more acceptable topics to discuss openly and in the press
3327523 we recognise care and the work that the ia does is changing with the advent of the internet people are becoming better informed
3327524 a series of errors resulted in a tragic incident causing permanent damage to a mans health but given the circumstances this could easily have resulted in a fatality
3327525 falls from height remain the most common cause of fatal injuries
3327526 this case illustrates that risks should be properly assessed and the results acted upon to ensure that decisions can be taken on appropriate equipment and working practices to be used so employees are safe
3327527 it shall be the duty of every employer to ensure so far as is reasonable practicable the health safety and welfare at work of all his employees
3327528 it shall be the duty of every employer to conduct his undertaking in such a way as to ensure so far as is reasonably practicable that persons not in his employment who may be affected thereby are not thereby exposed to risks to their health or safety
3327529 any person at work suffers a major injury as a result of an accident arising out of or in connection with work
3327530 following the 2004 tsunami there was a critical need to provide food to thousands of survivors in indonesia sri lanka and the maldives
3327531 our partnership with wfp met this immediate need after the tsunami and has continued to provide food and nutrition education for vulnerable tsunami affected families and schools in indonesia for the past year and a half
3327532 these activities helped reduce anemia rates by up to 20 among young children in aceh and also improved attendance and learning behaviors of students says ms angela van rynbach representative and country director of wfp

3327535 preissenkungen um zwei drittel sind reine spekulation denn den maximalen zollsatz von 66 1 prozent hat kein einziger marktteilnehmer gezahlt
3327536 hinzu kommt dass immer wieder billigware ber drittl nder in die eu eingef hrt worden ist um die z lle zu umgehen
3327537 die qualit t und damit die preise bestimmen letztlich die eink ufer des handels

3327542 almost half the people who develop these tumours die from them and those who survive often suffer severe side effects from the treatment
3327543 improved treatments are urgently required but in order to develop these we need a deeper understanding of the molecular and cellular origins of medulloblastomas
3327544 there was good evidence that either cell type could be the origin of medulloblastomas but no one considered that both sets of evidence could be correct and that these tumours could actually begin in two different cell types
3327545 identifying the normal cell that gives rise to a tumour is important because it allows direct comparisons between tumour cells and their normal counterparts so that key differences and vulnerabilities in the tumour can be identified
3327546 also recent studies suggest that cells resembling the original cell may persist in mature tumours and can be critical in ensuring its survival if so these cells would be an excellent target for treatment
3327547 it has always been thought that cells had to mutate several times before becoming a tumour
3327548 in this study we found that some stem cells only needed to mutate once
3327549 they would not turn cancerous immediately but once they had been given an instruction to turn into a more specialised cell the mutation would take hold and they would instead turn into a tumour
3327550 viread will be an important new treatment option and its approval represents a significant step forward in the fight against chronic hepatitis b
3327551 the approval of viread for hepatitis b represents more than a decade of work in both the fields of hiv and hepatitis b to develop a medication that offers significant viral suppression once daily dosing and a well established safety profile
3327552 we extend our thanks to the investigators and patients who participated in the clinical trials that support todays approval and we look forward to partnering with community members to increase disease awareness and expand access to treatment for those patients in need
3327553 although weve made great strides in reducing the overall incidence of chronic hepatitis b in the united states the disease still takes a devastating toll in asian american communities
3327554 greater public awareness and effective new treatment options are urgently needed to help reduce this significant health disparity
3327555 this report is a welcome means of raising awareness of older people and mental health an issue which is all too often mis diagnosed and left untreated
3327556 general practitioners have a key role to play in more effectively pinpointing possible depression as patients present themselves
3327557 help the aged continues to be concerned at the worryingly high levels of age discrimination within health services something which the charitys just equal treatment campaign has highlighted
3327558 mental health issues should not be taboo subjects more understanding of the treatable nature of conditions such as depression is urgently needed no older person should ever lack support or help with mental health issues

3327560 i didnt expect to hit hot buttons on the atheist side as much i expected it on the religious side
3327561 what we had was a good sizable group of players that we might call militant atheists and the rest of the players seemed very tolerant including all of the religious players
3327562 these figures demonstrate why it is so important jdrf continues to raise awareness of this chronic condition to ensure people receive the best possible care and treatment
3327563 good management of diabetes can help reduce the risk of complications such as heart disease stroke and kidney disease type 1 diabetes affects around 350 000 people in the uk so what we really need is to find the cure for the condition only research will find the cure and jdrf exists to fund that research
3327564 inflation is likely to touch the 13 14 per cent mark by october but it may soften after that

3327568 our all other things being equal forecast suggests easing fundamentals and potentially higher stocks in the months to come
3327569 we would hesitate before automatically extrapolating the recent price trend

3327571 while on leave from union army in monroe county he was captured by a band of confederate guerillas or bushwackers from the area
3327572 they stripped uncle john tied a rope around his neck threw it over a tree limb and pulled him off the ground until he about choked theyd let him down and then repeat the process while this amusement was going on word came that a union patrol was in the area
3327573 two men were assigned to take uncle john deeper into the woods and shoot him when they arrived at a rail fence uncle john managed to push one of his guards over the fence and knock the other one down and run away
3327574 instead of hiding in the deep woods he managed to get to a lightly wooded section and cover himself with leaves while the search for him went on in the more heavily forested area
3327575 some time after the war knowing some of his captors they being from the same area he killed a couple of them and was sent to prison for a few years until pardoned

3327578 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3327579 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3327580 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3327581 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3327582 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3327583 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3327584 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad

3327586 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
3327587 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3327588 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3327589 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3327590 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales

3327593 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3327594 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3327595 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3327596 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3327597 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3327598 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3327599 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

3327626 we looked at figures nationwide and we found that use of the therapy was extremely variable
3327627 basically a lot of people who should be getting the therapy arent and some of the people who are getting it may not need it
3327628 our findings parallel previous studies evaluating adoption of new medical technology in that they show racial disparity in who is receiving the newest therapies
3327629 in contrast to previous studies however we didnt find any gender gap in the use of crt
3327630 crt is an effective therapy for many patients and this study suggests clinically practice varies greatly compared to what it should be according to recommended guidelines
3327631 the use of chili peppers as a spice has spread to nearly every culture within 20 degrees of the equator and it tends to decline as you move toward the poles

3327633 we all possess some intuitive sense we know our convictions from our mere hunches
3327634 this sense of confidence or lack thereof is critical to our success but how it arises in the brain has long been a mystery
3327635 these neurons seem to have been registering after the rat made its decision how uncertain the animal was that it was about to receive its desired reward
3327636 we tested several alternative explanations but the best explanation for the neural activity we observed was that these neurons were signaling the confidence of the animal about its decisions
3327637 although previous work had suggested that confidence estimates might be a complex process restricted to humans and perhaps other primates
3327638 our results to the contrary show that for the brain to estimate confidence in a choice is no more complex than calculating the choice itself
3327639 this new option to abort and restart constitutes a decision that should be made based on the level of confidence about getting a reward
3327640 ultimately confidence about getting a reward is a direct function of the animals confidence about the decision they have just made in this way we sought to measure a variable internal to the animals how confident they were about whether they made the right choice or not by observing how it influenced their behavior
3327641 that confidence estimation is not a complex function specific to humans but a core component of the process of decision making probably found throughout the animal kingdom
3327642 future studies of this kind may illuminate the question of how we form an intuitive sense of the solidity of a belief how we distinguish fact from fiction itself
3327643 vigorous exercise running at middle and older ages is associated with reduced disability in later life and a notable survival advantage

3327725 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intent in georgia and the region
3327726 these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize relations with the united states and europe
3327727 if the united states and europe dont stop russia i think this is the end of what we thought of as the post soviet era
3327728 the russians feel they have been treated like dirt by the world for the last 20 years now theyre back

3327780 given its location and the works capacity for treating liquid from a sludge thickening process pembroke dock was the ideal choice
3327781 however the upgrading work required was considerable the obsolete sludge thickener had to be replaced additional storage capacity created and a domestic sludge reception facility installed
3327782 we presented it with a wide variety of sludges including tenby sas fishguard and milford haven it coped with everything we could throw at it and consistently produced a cake of 20 to 30 ds maximum dry solids output achieved was a surprising 38
3327783 its had to cope with a similarly varied range of sludge types and take the lions share of the countys loading while weve been upgrading the other two sludge centres in the area

3327810 conversions when sold in significant quantities will need to prove in some way that they do not increase criteria emissions but in order to avoid a high cost of entry that would prevent small innovative shoestring budget operations from starting out there is high value in tolerating small quantities of conversions with lower level oversight

3327841 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3327842 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3327843 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3327844 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3327845 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3327846 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3327847 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3327867 if you leave aggression to go unchecked you only store up graver problems for the future
3327868 russia has used massive and disproportionate force against an independent and sovereign democracy
3327869 this is completely unacceptable under international law and we and our allies must not beat around the bush in condemning russia very clearly
3327870 it looks increasingly as if russia intends to topple the elected government of georgia and to try and cripple that country
3327871 russia is sending a clear message to the countries of the former soviet union that you only enjoy limited sovereignty and you cannot behave in ways moscow disapproves of
3327872 today russia says it is fighting in defence of russian citizens in south ossetia who will it be defending tomorrow russians in the ukraine russians in the baltic states russians in central asia
3327873 this is a dangerous doctrine with worrying echoes from the darkest chapters of european history
3327874 threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3327875 there is a clear responsibility on the russian government to bring this conflict quickly to an end
3327876 tangible reality of full political and community support for policing
3327877 spectre of times past had also reared its ugly head
3327878 indicting kaing guek eav alias duch and sending him forward for trial for crimes against humanity and grave breaches of the geneva conventions of 12 august 1949 on war crimes
3327879 this type of understanding may serve as a direct call to publishers to do a better job at optimizing ad sales which may include partnering with different networks to get more value out of their inventory
3327880 we can recover from an oil spill but damage from mining operations would be permanent

3327883 next year may be too late and time is running out for our aging veterans
3327884 our veterans and our community look to your leadership to seize this historic moment and make good americas promise to these veterans
3327885 its a very clear message to the insurgents that there will be no other chance
3327886 our neighbors have started to realize and recognize that iraq is on the road to recovery
3327887 we are so proud of terry and are going to miss him terribly
3327888 he was true to his art and respected by all the industry he was the actors actor
3327889 he will be sorely missed there are not so many like him anymore
3327890 he was a very powerful character actor able to play villains and nice roles with ease he was particularly good at playing pinter roles which were very difficult
3327891 i must admit that my primary perspective on this issue is work based learning where this scenario would be extremely rare

3327895 playing the springboks in south africa might be the biggest challenge in world rugby at the moment
3327896 the georgian olympic war is quickly becoming a measuring stick of washingtons squandered international power after years of war in iraq and afghanistan and severely strained relations with allies
3327897 we are working very hard with the europeans to try to resolve the conflict
3327898 the russians have said that the one thing they want is for the u s and the europeans not to do things such as bring georgia and ukraine into nato does that suggest options i dont know
3327899 what there is to lose is the stability of the framework that the u s thought was going to govern the post cold war world when one country conquers another thats typically regarded as pretty serious and the inability to do anything about it is something the united states is not all that accustomed to
3327900 what they have to be thinking in moscow is that the bush administration is only around for another five months
3327901 the dynamic might be different if it was the beginning of the new administration and they were trying to shape a new relationship
3327902 russias goal is not to occupy georgia but to assert its own interests in the region and to humiliate embarrass and eventually dislodge saakashvili from power once it has humiliated him enough and made its point then it would be ready to negotiate a diplomatic settlement

3327907 its an amazing opportunity lara is strong athletic confident and independent so its a huge responsibility to take on her role
3327908 shes got everything that a woman aspires to be like and everything that a man would like to meet
3327909 shes still a leading icon in games but maybe shes not as big as she used to be
3327910 the last couple of games have had their ups and downs and weve yet to see a true next generation lara croft video game
3327911 designed with an incredible attention to detail that creates a truly believable world and delivers a new level of challenge and choice
3327912 shes still as relevant today as she ever was whether she can surprise us still remains to be seen
3327913 lara croft is an iconic gaming character she just goes from strength to strength
3327914 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
3327915 political discussion and open public debate on how to solve the problem by peaceful means
3327916 foolish to engage in a confrontation in the tskhinvali region i e south ossetia because it is bound to affect civilians immediately
3327917 in the history of the business i dont think its ever been tougher for producers
3327918 the market is changing and studios are always looking for con financing opportunities
3327919 the producers skill set is going to have to include the ability to bring in financing from overseas sources like dubai china india and other parts of asia

3327930 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3327931 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3327932 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them

3327940 amerika hat georgiens regierung immer wieder mit milit rberatern und waffen versorgt und so bei georgiens pr sidenten die illusion erzeugt er k nne machen was er wolle die usa w rden schon zu ihm halten

3327942 i do so love this piece great threading of lots of interesting points great view here so thanks
3327943 i like to read smart blogs so when i started looking for bloggers to review my book toy box leadership one my first choices was dj francis at onlinemarketerblog com
3327944 if marketing is viral you are the pathogen and i mean that in the positive cutting edge sense of the word
3327945 if you ask every guy that passes by right now what we see out of chad
3327946 its that the ball comes out on time receivers turned their heads and it almost hit them in the face a couple of times its amazing to see that on day 1
3327947 its instinct of the game thats what he brings to us and yesterday was kind of evident not to disrespect the other guys that were in there but chad brings a certain presence everybody had a little swagger on the other side of the ball and it was good to see
3327948 theres no reason to dwell on it im thankful that things worked out where i was able to stay and be the starting quarterback here when its all said and done thats what really matters to me
3327949 i was impressed simply by the fact he was a quick study
3327950 he was able to step out there and step in the huddle spew the verbiage out get people lined up and actually get the ball around
3327951 the rumors about him throwing hard yeah theyre true cotchery said with a smile
3327952 it takes a little time to get adjusted but i think well be fine as receivers once you get adjusted to the balls with more zip youll be fine
3327953 i see why hes so great he has a lot more touch than people would think he can make all types of throws
3327954 anybody who wants to beat me up for this they should have at it
3327955 the truth is you cant possibly beat me up more than ive already beaten myself up
3327956 i was taken in by his magnificent rhetoric and now i think hes treacherous
3327957 its an insult greater than i could ever imagine that he would do this to that magnificent family he has
3327958 he was trying to relieve himself of the horror of what he had done almost saying had i known that she was in the last stages of her life i would never have done it
3327959 what that demonstrates is that he had no love for his wife because you dont do that to someone you love he has soiled her
3327960 i dont think that candidates private lives are particularly relevant to how theyll perform in office
3327961 if we rated our presidents by the quality of their private lives youd have to say that nixon and bush are two of the best presidents we ever had
3327962 john edwards knows what the rules are he knew at the time he ran for president that he was having an affair and he should have known that was going to come out it was reckless for him to run for president under those terms i feel very disappointed in him his campaign the judgment he showed
3327963 it would have been better if hed issued an apology and just gone away
3327964 tarnishes the moral credibility hes built through his work on poverty and it also raises questions about his overall judgment
3327965 do you think most people realize that their doctor only knows 75 of the answers
3327966 i think they expect us to know 100 of the answers
3327967 i dont know but i know who i can ask
3327968 everything senator mccain has done has been to widen that gap between the richest and most powerful corporations and small businesses
3327969 working families are looking for a leader who will get our economy moving again and obamas continued clinging to the failed tax and spend policies of the past will do exactly the opposite
3327970 to call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking get him down there and get him to work
3327971 theres no question the selection of tom ridge as john mccains running mate would make our job harder here
3327972 even with tom ridge on the ticket i believe sen obama could and would carry the state
3327973 not protect any person or entity through false information or omission
3327974 it has to be conscious you have to know what youre doing
3327975 when it comes to the crisis in our housing market they seem intent on making things worse rather than better
3327976 their decision to brief out the possibility of a stamp duty holiday was completely reckless
3327977 far from bringing up the housing market theyve actually frozen it and this tells you everything you need to know about the government press handling and headlines above what is in the best interests of the country
3327978 we wont be announcing any conclusions today we wont be briefing our thoughts today this is a seminar to look at the issues its to engage with the experts to help us develop our policies
3327979 yet another worrying signal for families desperately trying to make ends meet
3327980 the most important concern up and down the country is the deteriorating state of our economy
3327981 hundreds of thousands of families now have the threat of negative equity hanging over them businesses are cutting back unemployment is creeping up and this mornings inflation figures are yet another worrying signal for families desperately trying to make ends meet
3327982 after everything weve heard from the prime minister about his fantastic economic record rpi inflation is 5 today it was 2 6 in 1997 and cpi is 4 4 today and it was 1 6 in 1997
3327983 that is not a good record and people are beginning to see that this decade of this chancellor now prime ministers conduct has not been that effective
3327984 history has shown time and time again that if you leave aggression to go unchecked you only store up graver problems for the future
3327985 this analysis was not undermined in any way by politicians
3327986 all government is evil and trying to improve it is largely a waste of time
3327987 we believe any decision at this time on whether he should remain majority leader is premature and wrong
3327988 as long as the buyer has a good reputation and is financially irreproachable his nationality doesnt matter
3327989 thanks to the success weve achieved during the past four years with powerballs com youll now be able to find a powerball in virtually every country in the world today everywhere in fact except china
3327990 were looking forward to changing that with the massive publicity this apec award will help generate for us all around asia going forward
3327991 are confident that rockefeller is christian gerhartsreiter and the person named christopher chichester who was living in the los angeles area in 1985
3327992 one thing we are certain of this defendants true name is not clark rockefeller
3327993 they just disappeared he just noticed at some point that they werent there any more he didnt think much of of it because he hardly knew them
3327994 there is nothing wrong with using aliases as long as you dont use it to defraud

3327996 the truth is that we are embracing new tools because theyre are either intriguing and fascinating to us and or because those within our social graph are also adopting them to stay connected and participate in online conversations

3327998 i participate in the communities where i find value and where i can in turn contribute to the value it is distributed it is decentralized however it is this way because each community sustains its own unique culture a culture that is only partially represented through the latest crop of aggregators and activity hubs such as friendfeed socialthing and ping fm

3328036 if the united states and europe dont stop russia i think this is the end of what we thought of as the post soviet era
3328037 the russians feel they have been treated like dirt by the world for the last 20 years now theyre back
3328038 not exactly the greatest hand of cards to have to play
3328039 what administration in history would not have sent somebody to moscow immediately why are we not in their face
3328040 the combination is that the overall means with which weve dealt with the russians over the last two years have painted them into a corner so that its difficult for them not to see us as hostile
3328041 georgia in a way is suffering for all that happened to russia in the last 20 years
3328042 now he can cruise the volga for all the remaining years or can go right to the bahamas

3328048 as robots enter our everyday life they need to have sensors everywhere on their bodies like humans

3328050 it could be completely integrated into the normal driving system making users unaware of using it
3328051 objects that come into contact with humans are often not square or flat we believe interfaces between humans and electronics should be soft

3328053 our study shows that early weight loss can reduce the risk factors that so often lead to diabetes complications and death
3328054 weve known for a long time that weight loss is an important component in diabetes treatment and prevention now it appears there may be a critical window of opportunity following diagnosis in which some lasting gains can be achieved if people are willing to take immediate steps toward lifestyle changes
3328055 we dont know if the initial weight loss increased the bodys sensitivity to insulin or if the sustained lifestyle changes were the reason for the long term health benefits
3328056 but we do know that losing weight reduces the risk factors that often lead to heart disease blindness nerve and kidney damage amputations and death in type 2 diabetes patients

3328061 auditory or visual auditory responses in the primary visual cortex are highly probable given the presence of direct projections from the primary auditory cortex
3328062 we looked for modulation of the neuronal visual responses in the primary visual cortex by auditory stimuli in an awake monkey
3328063 our findings show that single neurons from one primary sensory cortex can integrate information from another sensory modality
3328064 our results argue against a strict hierarchical model of sensory integration in the brain and that integration of multiple senses should be added to the list of functions of the primary visual cortex

3328106 when it comes to the crisis in our housing market they seem intent on making things worse rather than better
3328107 their decision to brief out the possibility of a stamp duty holiday was completely reckless
3328108 far from bringing up the housing market theyve actually frozen it and this tells you everything you need to know about the government press handling and headlines above what is in the best interests of the country
3328109 we wont be announcing any conclusions today we wont be briefing our thoughts today this is a seminar to look at the issues its to engage with the experts to help us develop our policies
3328110 yet another worrying signal for families desperately trying to make ends meet
3328111 the most important concern up and down the country is the deteriorating state of our economy
3328112 hundreds of thousands of families now have the threat of negative equity hanging over them businesses are cutting back unemployment is creeping up and this mornings inflation figures are yet another worrying signal for families desperately trying to make ends meet
3328113 after everything weve heard from the prime minister about his fantastic economic record rpi inflation is 5 today it was 2 6 in 1997 and cpi is 4 4 today and it was 1 6 in 1997
3328114 that is not a good record and people are beginning to see that this decade of this chancellor now prime ministers conduct has not been that effective
3328115 history has shown time and time again that if you leave aggression to go unchecked you only store up graver problems for the future
3328116 i condemn this terrorist attack that targeted us and this is not the first attempt

3328121 there continues to be reluctance on the part of both patients and treating physicians to accept the toxicity of platinum based therapy given the associated small gain in survival so active therapies with improved toxicity profiles are clearly needed
3328122 this is a promising alternative but needs further testing in randomized trials
3328123 this is an extremely rare case of co infection in a controlled monogamous relationship which showed us how a strong immune system in the elite suppressor kept the virus from replicating and infecting other cells
3328124 our findings offer hope to vaccine researchers because they reveal that the immune systems primary offense known as cd8 killer t cells can effectively halt disease progression by a pathogenic form of hiv
3328125 moreover the strength of the immune response was not dependent on infection by a weakened form of the virus and if we can harness the means by which these elite white blood cells stop the virus then we can hopefully teach or reprogram white blood cells in others to also target hiv
3328126 the presence of this genetic spot is a discordant result that strongly contradicts theories that various genetic factors alone play a protective role in suppression
3328127 elite suppression offers clues to vaccine researchers on many fronts how cd8 killer t cells can attack hiv and how a stronger immune response can force hiv into a permanent defensive state

3328203 finding another one is important to understanding how to find them and what they do and how they all interact
3328204 nearly 80 of plants that you dig up have got this relationship down in their roots with these fungi and that enhances their ability to take up nutrients
3328205 in australia that is important because we have really bad soil and the plants have to work hard to get water or nutrients out of the soil
3328206 this discovery is providing the biosynthetic genes for the compound thats needed to enhance the nutrient water uptake

3328228 i remember in a previous post about eating disorders you were told not to talk to a girl about how much weight shed lost is that a general guideline not talking about weight or dieting

3328230 what should you do if someone isnt open about it but you suspect they have an eating disorder

3328241 pese a estar en verano llueve sobre mojado y la consejer a de educaci n como todos los cursos escolares sigue incurriendo en su falta de planificaci n al adjudicar las obras de acondicionamiento y reformas de los centros educativos sin apenas margen para que los alumnos al comienzo de las clases inicien con normalidad el curso escolar
3328242 curso tras curso comprobamos como en muchos colegios e institutos los primeros meses escolares los alumnos tienen que compatibilizar sus clases con las obras iniciadas a destiempo con el consiguiente peligro que este hecho conlleva y las l gicas molestias que este tipo de situaciones comportan
3328243 el servicio de obras adscrito a la consejer a de educaci n que adjudica las mejoras de los colegios en la segunda quincena de julio sin tiempo material para que finalicen en la fecha oficial del inicio de curso a comienzos de septiembre pero tambi n tiene un responsable pol tico claro la consejera de educaci n que curso tras curso se va de vacaciones sin prever las caracter sticas de su departamento
3328244 por qu no existen medios en la consejer a de educaci n tras las experiencias de cursos anteriores para adelantar las adjudicaciones por lo menos un mes evitando de esta forma que alba iles alumnos y profesores tengan que convivir forzosamente unos d as deteriorando de esta forma la calidad de la ense anza y mermando la organizaci n escolar

3328294 before quitting the subject of freedom of opinion it is fit to take some notice of those who say that the free expression of all opinions should be permitted on condition that the manner be temperate and do not pass the bounds of fair discussion
3328295 weve always had drum horses and theyre always a very special and central part of the regiment
3328296 whenever we get the opportunity out comes the horse and on go the kettle drums
3328297 hes already part of peoples affections and thats really before hes got to know everybody

3328299 hes fairly massive hes got very big hooves and he likes fingers hes bitten me a couple of times but were bonding alright
3328300 first if any opinion is compelled to silence that opinion may for aught we can certainly know be true to deny this is to assume our own infallibility
3328301 secondly though the silenced opinion be an error it may and very commonly does contain a portion of truth and since the general or prevailing opinion on any subject is rarely or never the whole truth it is only by the collision of adverse opinions that the remainder of the truth has any chance of being supplied
3328302 we have hitherto considered only two possibilities that the received opinion may be false and some other opinion consequently true or that the received opinion being true a conflict with the opposite error is essential to a clear apprehension and deep feeling of its truth
3328303 i do not pretend that the most unlimited use of the freedom of enunciating all possible opinions would put an end to the evils of religious or philosophical sectarianism
3328304 the same thing holds true generally speaking of all traditional doctrines those of prudence and knowledge of life as well as of morals or religion
3328305 i saw aaron just like he is every day i thought he went out there he played with excellent energy which i always recall him playing with
3328306 but instead of seeking contrivances for this purpose obtaining reason through debate they have lost those they formerly had
3328307 if however the mischievous operation of the absence of free discussion when the received opinions are true were confined to leaving men ignorant of the grounds of those opinions it might be thought that this if an intellectual is no moral evil and does not affect the worth of the opinions regarded in their influence on the character the fact however is that not only the grounds of the opinion are forgotten in the absence of discussion but too often the meaning of the opinion itself the words which convey it cease to suggest ideas or suggest only a small portion of those they were originally employed to communicate instead of a vivid conception and a living belief there remain only a few phrases retained by rote or if any part the shell and husk only of the meaning is retained the finer essence being lost the great chapter in human history which this fact occupies and fills cannot be too earnestly studied and meditated on
3328308 it is illustrated in the experience of almost all ethical doctrines and religious creeds
3328309 what cicero practiced as the means of forensic success requires to be imitated by all who study any subject in order to arrive at the truth
3328310 there is a class of persons happily not quite so numerous as formerly who think it enough if a person assents undoubtingly to what they think true though he has no knowledge whatever of the grounds of the opinion and could not make a tenable defense of it against the most superficial objections
3328311 however unwillingly a person who has a strong opinion may admit the possibility that his opinion may be false he ought to be moved by the consideration that however true it may be
3328312 let us add one more example the most striking of all if the impressiveness of an error is measured by the wisdom and virtue of him who falls into it
3328313 the expression of rootedness a sense of place and of history a sense of self derived from forebears kin and culture an identity that is both collective and personal
3328314 the west is supporting one palestinian faction over the other its all about politics not human rights
3328315 we have warned of the west bank government turning into a security regime and there are indications that we are heading in that direction

3328414 we are very encouraged by the significance of these findings including data in non human primates which continue to validate pcsk9 as an attractive target for a systemic rnai therapeutic approach given its ability to achieve acute and durable reductions in ldl cholesterol
3328415 pcsk9 is well validated based on human genetics but it has been a difficult protein to target using traditional drug discovery modalities such as small molecules and monoclonal antibodies thus rnai affords perhaps the only viable approach for new medicines targeting this key mechanism for control of ldl metabolism
3328416 there is a clear unmet medical need for novel agents that can lower ldl cholesterol and pcsk9 appears to be an excellent genetically validated target for disease intervention
3328417 based on its novel mechanism of action and pre clinical data to date an rnai therapeutic targeting pcsk9 has the potential to rapidly lower ldl cholesterol while possibly functioning synergistically with statins in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia

3328523 this is the real china it is not a great power so it wont have a relaxing fun and festive attitude like a great power beijing is too heavy too tiresome this time the performance of the government and people really changed or reinforced my understanding of china to put it plainly we have the isolated mentality of a small country we cannot take criticism we care about face too much we really just talk to ourselves we especially do not know how to communicate with others on an equal footing we are not a great power so dont cheat ourselves by saying we are a great power instead we mix arrogance and inferiority get all confused and cannot do anything in a normal way
3328524 there is something almost in our dna that triggers autonomic and sometimes extreme responses to foreign criticism or put downs
3328525 throughout the ages chinese have had only one way of looking at foreigners
3328526 every chinese wants to get back the name which once belonged to this land the name is
3328527 all neighbors submit to her and all foreigners come to her to offer congratulations
3328528 anyone who offends the powerful han will be destroyed regardless of the distance

3328533 israel is following with great concern the developments in south ossetia and abkhazia and hopes the violence will end
3328534 israel recognizes the territorial integrity of georgia and calls for a peaceful solution
3328535 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
3328536 a small group of georgian soldiers were able to wipe out an entire russian military division thanks to the israeli training
3328537 georgian minister tells israel radio thanks to israeli training were fending off russian military

3328539 internalized israeli military technique and if the special reconnaissance forces have chalked up any successes
3328540 idf vets who trained georgia troops say war with russia is no surprise
3328541 every bomb that falls on our heads is an attack on democracy on the european union and on america
3328542 the intensifying warfare in the former soviet republic of georgia has put a new focus on the increasingly hard line that senator john mccain has taken against russia in recent years with stances that have often gone well beyond those of the bush administration and its focus on engagement
3328543 the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
3328544 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate cease fire

3328553 arsenal are one of the strongest teams we could have met
3328554 but for our young team it will be something special the young players can get a lot of experience in these big matches not only now but with one eye on the future
3328555 in the two matches against arsenal we are not just the underdogs but we are very big underdogs
3328556 nobody will expect fc twente to beat arsenal we have nothing to lose
3328557 i am really impressed by the organisation of fc twente
3328558 i see people who are working for the club with passion and want to go further
3328559 on the pitch i found a group with a very good fitness level so we could immediately work on the performance
3328560 looking back to last season is useless that was the first thing i made clear to the squad you cannot live on the success you had before
3328561 we want to go on down the line that brought success before and that is what we are working on now
3328562 at the draw it soon became clear we would get a strong opponent and arsenal is certainly that
3328563 they are one of europes best and they will be two very difficult matches for us
3328564 of course we are the underdogs but in football anything is possible
3328565 i have enjoyed my time training at stoke and everyone has made me feel very welcome
3328566 i know some of the lads here already like salif diao andy griffin and vincent pericard and things have gone well so far

3328568 i would like to be a part of that and help the club establish itself in the premier league

3328580 the folks at iron horse share my vision for building bikes with real proven suspension technology rather then concocting some gimmick to market for another few years before the next new gimmick

3328599 working with avaya we have our communications requirements and implementation down to a science
3328600 we dont have time for complicated installations and we have zero tolerance for risk what we do need are powerful reliable communications that help manage costs and enable the nbc olympics team to do their jobs most efficiently avaya understands that completely
3328601 through 2010 enterprises will miss the equivalent of 5 to 10 of annual sales as lost opportunity that could have been captured through improved management of sales territories quotas and compensation plans

3328605 were at a point now with the reality of global warming and the energy crisis that we all realize we have to start behaving differently and being a bit kinder to the earth it has gotten to the point where everyone is starting to ask ok how can i do my part to save the planet so we found a green home builder and asked her to teach us how the average person who wants to be more green in their daily life can effectively be more green
3328606 companies can get lost trying to implement overly complex it governance strategies and unfortunately in the process end up creating large bureaucracies and complex metrics that contribute little value to the organization
3328607 were finding that many companies have made rapid progress in their it governance initiatives by starting with a ppm implementation focused on a simple and pragmatic approach these companies have been able to make measurable impact on the business while implementing reasonable controls adding layers of further sophistication only when and where they were really needed
3328608 when we implemented our it governance process we were actively working on 20 projects and we identified 60 additional projects that our three business units wanted us to accomplish so we needed to establish an effective prioritization process
3328609 with the innotas on demand ppm solution as a core of our it governance process we have complete visibility into all of our active and potential projects and we can easily prioritize them and focus on the projects that add the most value to the business
3328610 in keeping with surequests tradition of utilizing leading edge technology and remaining responsible to our clientele to ensure continuity we have chosen this time to announce that our threesquares product as well as all new software product releases will be available using the widely accepted on demand technology via the internet as well as in traditional installed software versions
3328611 surequest was an early adopter of the software as a service saas business model in 1993 we found our market highly receptive to renting software over the traditional practice of capitalizing the expense of both software and hardware this recurring revenue business model in place at surequest for over 15 years uniquely positions the company to take advantage of what has become widely known and accepted as software as a service advances in internet technology and the widespread availability of high speed bandwidth have made on demand delivery practical and highly desirable to our marketplace it is also a perfect match for our business model today surequest offers both software as a service and on demand delivery thus meeting the varied needs of all our customers while many software companies have chosen to transition exclusively to this saas business model we feel it is still important to give the customer a choice for example if a customer has invested in a large it infrastructure there may be a reluctance to switch immediately to an on demand solution and they may wish to stay with the more traditional software license and support structure with surequests unique design we can accommodate that customer today as well as tomorrow when the timing is right to transition to software as a service
3328612 our financial industry customers are under increasing pressure to deliver software in a competitive global marketplace alignment between business and it teams is a critical junction and capgemini has a long legacy helping customers address this challenge and improve their application quality while reducing development costs our joint service solution offers the industrys leading combined solution of software packaged ip and professional services to give our financial services customers the ultimate solution to todays modern challenges

3328616 we didnt know what to do were not prepared for war
3328617 what do you do when the biggest country in the world wants to pound your city

3328619 die rohmilch gibt ihm seine reichhaltigkeit den geschmack die originalit t
3328620 it will be good for the players its a big challenge this is the second biggest cup competition and wed like to get a run in it
3328621 it could be good financially for us and we would hope to get a decent gate though hibs havent started too well and that may affect it
3328622 if we continue to play as we have they could be under a bit of pressure its certainly something for the players to look forward to
3328623 were not worrying about in now though as we have three games to play before then
3328624 im fine i went to the hospital after the game and it turns out ive got badly bruised ribs the physio tells me i was unconcious for about 15 seconds but i dont remember anything about it
3328625 im hoping to train and then well see how it goes
3328626 he walker will want to play but well have to see we dont want to rush him we have to make sure hes fully recovered
3328627 hes turned his career round and is probably our number one striker after being three or four when he first arrived at cappielow
3328628 i think its a confidence thing he hadnt played much at hamilton and it maybe took him a while to adjust when he came here
3328629 but he has worked hard and turned his game round he has really pushed on and as i say he is probably our number one striker and thats no disrespect to jon newby and iain russell
3328630 a friend that always kept a smile on my face youll be sadly missed well never forget you
3328631 its a tragic accident no other vehicles were involved inquiries into the cause of the crash are continuing and we are appealing for witnesses to come forward
3328632 north korea were unbelievably well organised so we are delighted to come through the group
3328633 in fact no air strikes have taken place in gori
3328634 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3328635 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3328636 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3328637 they are demanding 4 000 yuan 590 dollars for one ticket for the water cube
3328638 we will look into this to see whether it is true or not
3328639 since the test events we have implemented fixed measures to prevent scalping and have deployed more people to implement our anti scalping measures
3328640 we do have some reserved seats for the olympic families
3328641 for the preliminaries some people might not show up and that is understandable
3328642 and for competitions like beach volleyball and basketball we have one ticket for the whole morning whole afternoon or whole evening but spectators might only choose one of several matches of the time period to watch
3328643 the responsibility rests with the local authorities and venue managers
3328644 if they find that there are too many empty seats they will organize some cheerleaders who are volunteers
3328645 their job is to cheer for both sides and generate a good mood
3328646 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3328647 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3328648 many arrests are due to behaviour caused by excessive drinking
3328649 know your limit and try not to drink more than you usually would at home be aware that your travel insurance may not cover you if you have an accident whilst under the influence of alcohol
3328650 they measure temperature and salinity as a function of depth as they dive down and up through the water column and from that information we can determine what the ocean currents are doing
3328651 they provide us with a very detailed record of how temperatures and salinity change and from that information we can infer how much sea ice forms
3328652 its the first time we have been able to actually measure how fast sea ice forms
3328653 if we want to understand whats going to happen to climate in the future we need to know what the sea ice is going to do will there be more or less and will it form more or less rapidly
3328654 the detection of a new avian influenza virus strain in africa raises serious concerns as it remains unknown how this strain has been introduced to the continent
3328655 it seems to be unlikely that wild birds have carried the strain to africa since the last migration of wild birds from europe and central asia to africa occurred in september 2007 and this years southerly migration into africa has not really started yet
3328656 it could well be that there are other channels for virus introduction international trade for example or illegal and unreported movement of poultry
3328657 many countries have succeeded in getting the virus under control but as long as avian influenza remains endemic in some countries the international community needs to be on alert both at risk and affected countries have to keep a high level of surveillance

3328659 indonesian corruptors are shameless they get their names and deeds splashed in the press all the time and no one cares

3328667 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3328668 the creation of the small sat bus or spacecraft used for the scisat satellite has enabled the csa to acquire and improve its expertise in small satellite operation the data collected by scisat aids scientists in better understanding the impact pollutants have on the upper atmosphere and ozone layer which is of particular interest to canadians and especially important for the high arctic

3328673 copper cathode production steadily increased during the second quarter and continues to do so as filtration performance and capacity in the copper leach circuit improves
3328674 however with luilu output continuing to ramp higher the miners will need to take their performance up a few notches
3328675 engineering and construction work for kamoto phase ii and for the first module of the new metallurgical section at luilu is progressing well and our full feasibility study for the integrated and expanded project is on track to be available near the end of the third quarter
3328676 the mou announced on august 5th establishes the framework for amending our jointventure agreement with gecamines and addresses requirements coming from the government mining review we have now outlined the way forward to get full operational and financial benefit from the merger with nikanor

3328679 no way a man can live in a big fish
3328680 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3328681 we will qualify for the world cup we will be in south africa i am sure of it
3328682 we are a very good team it is always the same for us the opponent is not important the important thing is what we do
3328683 i watched some games live and saw the rest on tv
3328684 only spain played in a different style only the characteristics of their play were different
3328685 but i have a lot of confidence in my team and i think we will be okay
3328686 i will announce the captain two days before the game
3328687 i will speak with the captain just a moment before i tell the rest of the squad then everyone else will find out
3328688 openid offers at best a little convenience and ignores the security vulnerability inherent in the process of typing a password into someone elses web site
3328689 sourceforge the worlds largest open source development site recently started accepting openids
3328690 openid is getting tremendous traction and we are happy to be jumping into it its bringing us back in touch with fresh web 2 0 technology
3328691 as of now we have not heard of any plans that have been cancelled
3328692 if they do not build now they would miss their chance when market conditions improve

3328704 evan chandler haddock quietly passed away late sunday evening just short of his second birthday
3328705 although evans family firmly believes that through the gospel of jesus christ they will be reunited with their son and brother after this life they are naturally suffering the pains of their unexpected loss we invite all people of any denomination or no denomination to pray to our heavenly father on behalf of the haddock family
3328706 if theres a single life saved out of this it is well worth whatever negatives are associated with this
3328707 the goal of the program is to reduce the number of serious crashes at vehicle intersections

3328765 no question there has been too much subsidy right now i think its a very good time for a timeout
3328766 lavishing federal subsidies on a food based fuel is insane and morally bankrupt

3328787 fatal influence that the independence of the haitians would have on their own slaves
3328788 under the new asylum regulations as well as the old foreign policy and border enforcement considerations are not relevant to the determination of whether an applicant for asylum has a well founded fear of persecution the fact that an individual is from a country whose government the united states supports or with which it has favorable relations is not relevant to the determination of whether an applicant has a well founded fear of persecution
3328789 the haitian immigrant equitable adjustment act a law designed to provide the same immigration adjustment rights for haitians as provided for cubans
3328790 since the cuban adjustment act became law the attorney general has used his discretion to allow over 600 000 cubans to become lawful permanent residents of the united states making it possible for them to eventually become u
3328791 haitian asylum claims were prejudged their rights to a hearing given second priority to the need for accelerated processing the district director did not grant a single request for asylum between september 1978 and may 1979 the denials were not on a case by case adjudication but an intentional class wide summary denial
3328792 the most dramatic example of a pattern of discrimination against an immigrant group
3328793 this case presents a painfully common situation in which desperate people convinced that they can no loner remain in their homeland take desperate measures to escape in which the haitian plaintiffs sued to stop the government from repatriating haitians that were in their custody
3328794 under existing law any refugee may reach the shores of the united states and thereby acquire the right to enforce united states immigration laws in u s courts except haitian refugees only haitian refugees are intercepted in international waters and repatriated to their country of origin
3328795 in short it is unquestionably reasonable for congress to make an aliens eligibility depend on both the character and the duration of his residence since neither requirement is wholly irrational this case essentially involves nothing more than a claim that it would have been more reasonable for congress to select somewhat different requirements of the same kind

3328819 they allow the secretary of state to remove a case from a jury on the vague ground that it is in the public interest the whole thing is an appalling violation of the separation of powers

3328829 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3328830 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3328831 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3328832 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3328833 its an opportunity to get together with other canal communities and see whats going on
3328834 the point is to take a really new and sort of creative approach to telling the story of the canal
3328835 hopefully people come away with at least one thing maybe two that give them a new way to look at what theyre doing in their community its big because it focuses on the new york state canalway system its the only conference that focuses exclusively on the erie canalway which is very important to fairport
3328836 opening the western gateway exploring the beauty of lockport buffalo and the niagara frontier
3328837 just the opportunity for people to talk about that i think is important and im glad carmella is going to take the lead on that

3328848 it is more confounding discomforting and totally out of place when it is borne in mind what purpose such ulterior and ungodly act was out to achieve when 2011 is still three years away
3328849 senator ahmad sani yarima is stating through this medium unequivocally and categorically that he could not have in his wildest imagination come out wtih such exercise when he is currently very busy with his legislative duties in the senate for which he was duly elected by his people
3328850 most importantly senator ahmad sani yarima affirm and strongly too that he is fully in support of president yaraduas adminsitration and his pursuit ofthe seven point agenda he has set for the nation
3328851 when they got there they found mr lonnie banks a 20 year old male had been shot in the chest
3328852 apparently there was some kind of disagreement or argument between a couple of women that either lonnie had known and he was there
3328853 we pretty much everyone knows everyone around here so thats why it was such a shock for us as neighbors to see such a violent crime in our neighborhood
3328854 legally and unfortunately nigeria is bound to obey the world court judgement which awarded bakassi to cameroun it is binding on us because we submitted voluntarily to the compulsory jurisdiction of the court unlike the advisory or consensual jurisdiction under which we would have decided not to obey the judgement
3328855 under the united nations protocol which nigerian signed we agreed to abide by the decision of the world court and the consequence of signing those protocol is that the decision of the world court will be binding on us so there is little room for us to maneuver it is too late in the day for us to say that we cannot abide by the judgement
3328856 we can seek a political and diplomatic solution since the people of bakassi are nigerians and are unwilling to go to cameroun why should we force them since from information available bakassi is not as rich in oil as previously thought there is no political gain for cameroun to want to expel the people from their hand the federal government can through the foreign affairs ministry liaise with cameroun foreign ministry and find a last political solution to the matter
3328857 the nigerian government is one that has made the rule of law one of its cardinal policies and now that there is a judgement of the icj nigeria subscribed to and accept that judgment it will be difficult for nigeria to at this point in time re consider accepting the judgement the verdict is about two years old and nigeria had not done anything about it
3328858 the bakassi issue is a lesson that nigeria must learn from not to resort to short cuts in matters that requires long term solution
3328859 bakassi matter is certainly beyond the issue of mere handing over it must be looked at politically

3328904 when i sent my first tape to the head of gramophone programmes at the bbc i had made the fatal mistake of forgetting to rewind it to the start yet that gentleman took the time to wind it all the way back and once hed listened to it things went from there i can tell you if i was a young chap coming over from ireland today they probably wouldnt even listen to my tape let alone rewind it somehow that old fashioned thoroughness and commitment have disappeared i suppose no one has the time for it anymore
3328905 when i started people who worked for the bbc knew they werent earning as much as people in commercial television but they did have the satisfaction of knowing that they worked for one of the finest if not the finest broadcasting organisation in the whole world
3328906 im not sure they feel that any more or at least that it means as much as it used to
3328907 we got a beautiful deck overlooking the water and we have the lower deck besides that and when people come out and look at the harbour all they see is rusty boats
3328908 removing the two abandoned vessels will eliminate any further potential for environmental or safety hazards and naturally it will free up space at the wharf
3328909 while somebody may determine the vessels environmentally friendly enough to dump at sea i dont think that either one of those vessels look environmentally friendly to the naked eye
3328910 to see them boats gone well hopefully it will make quit a bit of difference
3328911 we thought a couple or three years ago it was going to be done but its a very slow process going through government regulations
3328912 the last thing the government wants to do is be a dumping ground for abandoned vessels

3329239 maybe not i am not that sure to take a risk now next time maybe
3329240 i just wanted to be out on my own which i had done by the 100 meter mark that was my goal
3329241 it hasnt really sunken in yet when i first saw one by my name i thought i had made a mistake it was such a fast time
3329242 i feel honored to have found the ring and i dont need special thanks
3329243 its tough but the only thing my mind was really focused on was getting through this race that was perfectly fine to set myself up for a good race tomorrow
3329244 we just feel bad about this whole situation i wish it could have ended differently
3329245 until our cities can come together to put the guns down and pick up purpose and love we will see this again
3329246 musharraf is standing alone today due to our political strategies because we have succeeded in conveying our message to the international community that stability in pakistan can only be possible through genuine democracy and not through dictatorship
3329247 we are constantly in contact with mr sherpao we are hopeful that his partys members will vote for the impeachment resolutions against president musharraf
3329248 said his party would vote for the success of democracy indicating that its members might vote against the president
3329249 i have not received any direction from the central upa united progressive alliance leaders to resign there is no question of my resigning my government is safe
3329250 the upa high command is of the opinion that support to the koda government should be withdrawn if he fails to resign the congress has also asked him to resign the decision to make me chief minister by replacing koda was taken long back even lalu prasad had supported my chief ministership i dont know what he says now
3329251 i am quite impressed by the level and the extent of security that has been in place i think it is still another matter for us to be able to convey it to the full task team
3329252 that would be a challenge because we have personally come to do this visit and it will be upon us to convey that message and raise the confidence of the players that from what we have seen and experienced is the security measures that are in place should be sufficient to have an event that will be safe and secure
3329253 since security is the prime concern we bar men from entering this floor the lifts dont stop at the floor unless you swipe the lift board with your room key card
3329254 even hotel staff such as butlers and housekeepers are women on these floors
3329255 being sensitive to the needs of the woman travelling alone is a good concept extra security concern is equally welcome
3329256 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3329257 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganised
3329258 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3329259 i just wanted to be out on my own which i had done by the 100 metres mark that was my goal i was out in open water and i was out of the middle which makes it difficult for the other guys to see me
3329260 you cannot ask a rahul dravid sachin tendulkar sourav ganguly vvs laxman or anil kumble to prove their credentials
3329261 i think you should ask the selectors and the bcci this question i am happy with whatever they have in mind
3329262 i think it is just with time we should start winning in odis consistently we are a great team and we start doing well pretty soon
3329263 australia as a team is still far ahead yes we can beat australia and we have proved that but to do it consistently we have to improve a lot i think once we become more consistent we can think of being number one
3329264 section 377 of the ipc which criminalise men who have sex with men must go
3329265 i hope that the minister will now persuade his more medieval minded cabinet colleagues and make them understand that human rights are universal and one cannot be discriminated against for sexual orientation
3329266 in spite of section 377 homosexuals have continued to live love and have sex in india so it is really immaterial to the ipc act it has only stigmatised and made homosexuals more vulnerable thereby increasing their risks of contracting hiv which ultimately is a public health concern
3329267 its clear that at least for the foreseeable future the outcome of this conflict has been russias annexation of south ossetia and abkhazia
3329268 georgia has also seen a tremendous blow to its economy and potential to attract investment and a humanitarian tragedy but its too early to say that georgia has only lost
3329269 there is a little soul searching to do on the part of european countries in particular whats been shown is the wests utter inability or unwillingness to protect allies
3329270 for the united states for its credibility as a partner across eurasia has been severely damaged there is no country in which the united states has invested so much political capital as in georgia in this part of the world
3329271 obviously any ceasefire would be a start towards reconciliation but it would depend what conditions were attached and of course what happens next
3329272 but it wouldnt make an immediate difference to their rating it doesnt look very good for georgia going to war with russia is bad for your creditworthiness to put it mildly
3329273 we expect very positive market reaction to the effective end of military action and potential movement towards diplomatic resolution of the conflict as the likelihood of further escalation of armed conflict has eased
3329274 however we need to emphasize the crisis is not over yet we continue to believe the conflict is very unlikely to end in a new freeze into the quiet military standoff that has persisted since 1992 as such solution is unacceptable to both sides
3329275 it is a little bit of good news because the situation there can be relaxed a bit and some stopped supplies from kazakhstan and turkey can be shipped again soon oil from ceyhan is distillate rich so it is a good news but it is not such a big thing that the market is going to react significantly the oil market has not even reacted to the supply disruptions from ceyhan so we may not see a big change
3329276 i think probably the element of international concern has played a part what we dont know as yet are the dynamics of russian internal politics im sure there was a fairly intense debate going on behind the scenes in the kremlin
3329277 i would not expect a very strong or unified eu response in relation to this what we will find with increasing intensity is a sort of what to do with russia conversation but thats been doing on since 2004
3329278 its highly unlikely now that south ossetia will come back to georgia i think what these conflicts have pretty much sealed their fate of south ossetia and abkhazia
3329279 theyve acted as insulators against the resumption of georgian control unless there is a very intensive diplomatic track which works very consistently and rapidly towards a solution here but i think thats unlikely
3329280 ceasing fire today doesnt make a difference russia has already achieved most 80 percent of what it wanted to achieve it only did not achieve a regime change russia has shown precisely that it is in control of the southern caucasus it has consolidated its position
3329281 nato countries did not have a uniform stance on georgias and ukraines nato membership and russia took advantage
3329282 this is a very serious issue for ukraine we are thinking very seriously what it means for ukrainian politics
3329283 as long as ukraine is not a nato member russia can do as she pleases this situation could repeat itself in the pro russia crimean region maybe not today or tomorrow but in a year or two or three
3329284 its very positive news for the rouble because the georgian crisis was the only argument for the rouble weakness we saw in the last couple of days with the crisis seemingly gone the rouble should recover from the losses it suffered
3329285 certainly there will be a slightly higher risk premium to russia because the market normally remember such higher volatility periods for quite a while
3329286 if this news that military operations are stopping is correct then that it what this country needs and we can then get on to build peace
3329287 this is a beautiful place with a wonderful people they dont deserve the suffering that has been inflicted by military operations
3329288 we have to wait and see if this is implemented
3329289 russia militarily and politically achieved what it wanted in all that time apart from some verbal criticism it has not met any sharp or fundamental reaction from the united states nor europe
3329290 the eu council of ministers is only meeting tomorrow and it was russias interest to put them in front of a final state of affairs which they seem to have achieved
3329291 it would be tactically disadvantageous for russia to continue in its actions during that meeting given that they had achieved what they wanted
3329292 the attacks on the territory of georgia and the military action outside the areas of conflict discredited russia and i cannot see how russia wants to defend the role of an arbiter a neutral player in those conflicts
3329293 eu ministers should agree on changing the negotiating formats for the conflicts in ossetia and abkhazia the role of russia can no longer be that of an arbiter of these conflicts
3329294 well see a bounce in stocks we saw the currency bounce back this morning
3329295 nonetheless investors will remain cautious for some time this is just yet another in a long line of events that have raised political risk levels in russia
3329296 last month we had putin making some fairly ominous warning sounds on oao metal a mining conglomerate and hinting at the fact that they may have some tax irregularities ominous overtones that are reminiscent of what happened with yukos
3329297 we believe ubs investment bank will be not fully owned and even potentially disposed of by ubs over the next two years

3329316 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3329317 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3329318 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3329319 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3329320 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3329321 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3329322 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one

3329325 very few local authorities have used their powers to acquire itemised call records in relation to the investigations which they have conducted

3329327 persistently rip off consumers cheat the taxpayer deal in counterfeit goods and prey on the elderly and vulnerable
3329328 it is not right that we charge our police with combating crime and disorder and then tie their hands behind their backs in the name of whitehall bureaucracy
3329329 conservatives believe the police should be given both the resources and the freedom to use those resources to do their job
3329330 revising the ripa framework so that authorisation and all the paperwork that goes with it is not required for basic police work is just one way the conservatives will cut red tape to free more police onto our streets

3329373 if stella knew it was going to be used by hockley there is no way she would have lent it it was loaned to a stylist in good faith but when stella saw the picture she was furious
3329374 she didnt see any proofs she just saw the campaign its a monumental cock up stella is disgusted
3329375 hockley is aware of stella mccartneys views and is respectful of them
3329376 this was an unfortunate mistake hockley would not intentionally make anyone feel uncomfortable hockley both requested and was told that the item was a vintage piece and apologises for any embarrassment caused to stella mccartney

3329379 when i sent in my first tape to the head of gramophone programmes at the bbc i had made the fatal mistake of forgetting to rewind it to the start yet that gentleman took the time to wind it all the way back and once hed listened to it things went from there i can tell you if i was a young chap coming over from ireland today they probably wouldnt even listen to my tape let alone rewind somehow that old fashioned thoroughness and commitment have disappeared i suppose no one has the time for it any more

3329518 its been fully litigated and they cant do it thats all there is
3329519 we must do this because we cannot and will not tolerate innocent people especially children to be victims
3329520 this is not something we take likely but given the incident of this weekend we need to take firm action and this is the kind of action thats required in order to ensure the safety of our residents
3329521 but this is aimed at helping young people in our city this is not an attempt to be punitive

3329525 la raz n por la que la peque a yang de siete a os no fue elegida fue porque quer amos proyectar la imagen correcta est bamos pensando en qu era lo mejor para la naci n
3329526 una peque a cantante gana el coraz n de la naci n
3329527 fue complicado una sensaci n muy fea me sent muy mal en ese momento por suerte mis compa eros me ayudaron mucho y el gol qued como una an cdota porque el equipo pudo ganar que era lo m s importante y lo que quer amos
3329528 despu s del gol estaba muy mal pero trat de no volverme loco enseguida me di cuenta de que ten a que pensar en el equipo porque lo m s importante para nosotros era el resultado me com la bronca trat de serenarme y por suerte despu s me salieron las cosas bien y pude cortar varias pelotas importantes
3329529 nunca si no hubiese aprendido y tampoco vi muchos goles que lo metan de esa manera me acuerdo muchos de mitad de cancha como los de palermo chilavert o calder n pero nunca fueron despu s de un gol del propio equipo
3329530 ellos fueron muy inteligentes sacaron r pido y boselli le peg justo yo me fui del partido no mir la pelota fue una desgracia que no pas a mayores
3329531 en el primer set no nos hemos encontrado a gusto en ning n momento ten amos problemas en la circulaci n de bal n y tras la recepci n no encontr bamos la velocidad y la efectividad necesaria para que nuestro ataque fuera fluido
3329532 giba podr a haber jugado caso de ser estrictamente necesario en el entrenamiento de ayer se hizo un poco de da o en el hombro derecho en ese mismo hombro tuvo una lesi n esta temporada en rusia de todas formas confiamos en poder recuperarlo para los pr ximos partidos este descanso le habr venido muy bien
3329533 serbia es un equipo muy alto y fuerte que siempre nos crea muchos problemas nosotros no podemos competir de igual a igual con ellos y tenemos que hacer otras cosas con una mayor defensa conseguimos recuperar m s balones y tambi n conseguimos que el bal n circulara mejor
3329534 pero no fue nada f cil todos los sets se han definido al final despu s de una gran labor de desgaste por nuestra parte
3329535 estamos en los juegos ol mpicos y aqu no hay rivales flojos rusia es especialmente fuerte y seguro que ser un partido muy competido y dif cil de ganar pero lo vamos a intentar con todas nuestras fuerzas
3329536 creo que el b isbol merece seguir en los juegos ol mpicos y nos toca a nosotros tener una buena presentaci n para motivar a la gente que decide
3329537 estoy convencido que en pek n daremos un gran espect culo deportivo
3329538 para este torneo no hay enemigo peque o pero tampoco tenemos otra opci n que no sea la de ganar la medalla de oro
3329539 el equipo ha trabajado bien llega en perfectas condiciones y estamos listos para el reto
3329540 estoy muy contento como ha respondido el equipo en los entrenamientos a pesar que la lluvia no ha ayudado en el trabajo
3329541 lleg la hora de la verdad y de demostrar que nuestra ausencia de atenas 2004 fue un simple accidente
3329542 estoy m s ilusionado que nadie de que pek n sea la cita con la segunda medalla de oro que podamos conseguir y adem s ayudar a que el b isbol vuelva a ser deporte ol mpico
3329543 el oro en pek n no eclipsar a lo conseguido en 1986 pero si reconozco que la medalla ser a el pin culo de mi carrera

3329545 estamos listos para el gran reto ol mpico y estoy seguro que no vamos a defraudar a nadie
3329546 no estoy teniendo buenas sensaciones como me viene sucediendo en los ltimos meses no encuentro la confianza en la cancha estoy trabajando para solucionarlo
3329547 es m s duro que perder en un torneo normal
3329548 la espectativa no es igual que en otros a os pero ahora tengo que recuperar la confianza eso es lo m s importante
3329549 the hp ipaq 910c business messenger is as its name implies a very good business phone like the blackberry curve it proves that business phones can be attractive and we do like the looks and compact size its a dream phone for those who love the t mobile dash moto q9 and blackjack ii but want windows mobile pro rather than standard edition the qwerty bar design is ever popular in the us and we do love it for easier one handed operation and expedience the ipaq doesnt bring any flashy design elements as do the htc touch pro or omnia but well largely forgive that since it aims to be a solid business and messaging phone rather than an iphone competitor that said we do wish it had a flush touch screen which would make it both more attractive and finger friendly while the ipaq couldnt be described as an iphone killer it certainly is a treo killer and were impressed with the display features design and build quality compared to recent windows mobile treo models

3329571 on thursday weak gdp gross domestic product data from germany and the eurozone will highlight the problems of the european economies putting euro dollar again under pressure
3329572 a rate cut within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda
3329573 if they raise prices they may see demand drop or they can opt for a higher market share with no price hikes which only large corporations can survive they are in trouble either way
3329574 profit margins are getting slimmer for companies in sectors such as electrical machinery or automobiles as consumer spending is weak
3329575 commodity prices including oil have declined significantly recently in addition the economy now clearly appears to be on a downswing and weakening domestic demand should weigh on final product prices

3329577 girls are not supposed to be actively seeking something a girl simply exists for someone to marry or divorce her
3329578 people who go for a picnic need to know each other a little longer than that let alone make a lifelong commitment
3329579 by the time they actually get to live together they are already tired of each other
3329580 if you are frustrated there is the possibility that you take it out through violence
3329581 some people choose the safer way in moving towards a more religious attitude not necessarily extremism but it might reach the point of extremism
3329582 i dont think people who harass women on the street are necessarily single or necessarily sexually frustrated there are many millions of people who are extremely frustrated but they do not harass women
3329583 i think the issue is one of violence and gender disparities pure and simple
3329584 they ask young girls here when they are three or four who would you marry they implant the idea your only purpose in life is to get married

3329592 no los seguimos su desempe o durante toda la temporada en jap n as que dependen de ellos mismos lo nico que podemos hacer es confiar en ellos
3329593 creo que tenemos que despedirnos de las olimpiadas con una nota positiva si esta es la ltima vez en las olimpiadas entonces tenemos que irnos como campeones
3329594 es algo nuevo para todos nosotros soy un purista del b isbol as que no estoy muy de acuerdo
3329595 estoy acostumbrado a jugar hasta que alguien gane a la antigua creo que todos estamos esperando a ver c mo va a funcionar
3329596 you dont win silver you lose gold much time has actually been passed when this created a controversy leaving all the controversies apart india has managed to win gold
3329597 it is for this reason that we would like to pay a special tribute to president ellen johnson sirleaf as the head of the executive and all members of the legislative branch the private sector the faith based organizations the civil societies and the people of liberia for their efforts they have been deploying to move liberia from a war torn country to a country that is steadily and sustainable on the path to recovery and development
3329598 we also believe that liberia is moving in the right direction as far as pursuing unity and reconciliation is concerned we sincerely hope that liberia can be peaceful forever but only liberians can keep the country together through unity in development in which all liberians have a role to play
3329599 we wish to pay a deserved tribute to the people of liberia and its leadership for the vital role played for the liberation of africa
3329600 we from the 35 members africa forum recognize the enormous challenges ahead of the people and leadership of liberia but at the same time we are confident that under the leadership of president ellen johnson sirleaf and in collaboration with the legislature the task of post conflict reconstruction and development is certainly not insurmountable
3329601 most of our countries are going through what we call the triple shocks of food insecurity the shock of poor health services and spread of hiv aids malaria and tuberculosis and the shock of energy
3329602 from our experience this is far from the truth the truth is that the real work actually starts after elections
3329603 we appeal to all opposition parties to engage the government with constructive criticism and bring positive suggestions and alternative solutions to the problems liberia is facing
3329604 we therefore wish to encourage liberians to remain with this spirit of reconciliation unity and development of their country because this is the only way you can have a peaceful liberia forever allowing liberians to enjoy the peace dividends
3329605 all of the topics are important the current mirraco team covers all the bases and has a good mix of riding skills and personalities not all of our team members are contest riders but they all have riding skills that translate into tv coverage video parts or magazine coverage some have tattoos some have lots of gold medals and some dont have any medals the point is were looking for diversity not clones when we come across someone with the potential to develop into a team rider well flow some product and see how things go if a spot opens up on the team well probably pick a flow rider who best fits the spot thats open
3329606 i am not buying the lie that sacrificing the arctic national wildlife refuge and americas coastal waters to oil drilling would make a real difference in gas prices either today or twenty years from today
3329607 with just three percent of the worlds oil reserves our nation simply doesnt have enough oil to impact the global market or drill our way to lower prices at the pump

3329626 recent escalation in military engagement between russia and georgia poses a threat to certain key oil and gas pipelines which transit georgia
3329627 there have been no deliberate attempts to damage that pipeline
3329628 we think it any attack would be counter active even though it can happen in a conflict
3329629 demonstrate that it is a volatile region it is a crucial region for getting caspian oil to consumer markets
3329630 with negligible domestic oil production unlike some of its caspian neighbours georgias significance to global oil and gas markets is as a transit corridor
3329631 threat of an attack on the btc baku tblisi ceyhan pipeline poses the bigger risk to oil markets it is clear that more generally georgia is a key energy transit hub in the caucasus region and a country of significant strategic importance to energy markets
3329632 the outage on the btc pipeline and recent hostilities in the caucasus highlight the potentially precarious nature of pipeline energy supplies in the region
3329633 with the btc currently closed disruption to georgian energy infrastructure further limits the possibility of getting caspian oil and gas to markets
3329634 renewed flows through georgia expected from september could be further delayed if the line is damaged during the russia georgia conflict
3329635 along the same corridor runs the south caucasus gas pipeline a branch of this pipeline continues through to the russian port of tuapse transiting the region of abkhazia another georgian area affected by separatist action where russian troops are reportedly also being mobilised
3329636 total products leaving georgian ports typically average 50 000 70 000 barrels per day
3329637 latest reports suggest that oil exports from poti have ceased while only partial operations are currently possible from supsa and batumi

3329650 builders and factories i talk to on a regular basis are just hanging on by their finger tips and many have gone out of business this year the industry is really having a difficult time and one main problem that is plaguing the industry is stick builders have lowered their prices to stay busy
3329651 i received a call from a man a couple of months ago that was considering having a custom stick built home constructed in north carolina in 2007 he was quoted 125 per square foot to have his custom home built because the price was so high he was considering a custom modular home which was around 93 per square foot at the time this person told me he was getting ready to sign a contract with the modular home company but his old contractor called him back and quoted him 80 per square foot a 35 percent reduction to make a long story short this person decided to go with the original stick builder and the modular home company lost the deal

3329664 we are concerned that there is a great deal of external inspiration and support we are also concerned and are looking at a mastermind within the country

3329670 were seeing an increase around the world due in part to the rise in islamic fundamentalism
3329671 i kept returning to this thought what would it do to a community to have a tradition as long and as defining as that to know from an early age that you were probably throughout your life going to be woven into this incredibly rich tapestry of time spirituality art and craft what would it be like to be a child growing up there to watch your parents and grandparents learning their lines and practicing their parts and building the sets and making the clothes it must be so rich such a powerful social binder and foundation
3329672 i see zubed as a key tool in enabling both our sales people and the business in achieving their maximum potential
3329673 zubed is already changing the way we view our business and is starting to change behaviours and results it will become a critical solution to maximising the return on our investments in sales retention people and our customers for the first time we will be able to target and approach retailers in specific segments with the right products and services to meet their developing needs
3329674 for too long sales teams and individuals have had to battle with irrelevant search results and inaccurate business categorisation
3329675 zubedsales means an end to this allowing sales people to spend more time meeting with real prospects and securing greater value customers after just a few minutes spent in our intuitive map based search environment
3329676 italians flew up the first climb like they were riding weightless hard tails
3329677 we were super tentative on that decent as im sure most were our hands were frozen and we could hardly modulate braking
3329678 we were going so hard up the climb we couldnt eat or drink and the descent didnt make it any easier at the end of the day we ended up downing maybe a bottle and a half of water
3329679 i was having a bit of a no sugar moment reported hestler with a smile on his face marty and stefan pulled up and then pulled over the top of that last climb then attacked on the final descent into k2 we ended up 4th for the day but i feel good about the ride and the climb we did today
3329680 i wont say there is a set plan but i will say it looks like we have an international rivalry on our hands as of day one tomorrow is going to be another survival day so we will settle in and see what the italians will do
3329681 we all know that whenever businesses engage in such talks normally somebody or some region emerges a winner and someone else winds up ultimately being negatively affected
3329682 i have already been in contact with the offices of the ceos of both of those airlines and have expressed my willingness to come see them to sit down with them and begin discussions about our airport here in northern kentucky
3329683 i am offering my help and my support in any way possible as those talks go on to try to make sure that somehow we as a community here in northern kentucky come out of those talks in the right way
3329684 they have a northwest hub in memphis which could conceivably be affected from some kind of merger
3329685 at least forty quid a night for special branch officers who were risking their lives to stop him being taken out by followers of the fatwa announced by irans ayatollah khomenei
3329686 he evans is portraying me as mean nasty tight fisted arrogant and extremely unpleasant in my humble opinion i am none of those things
3329687 the simple fact of the matter is that nothing of this sort happened my relationship with my protection team was always cordial certainly entirely professional this kind of absurd behaviour never occurred there are three references in his article to drinking on duty it is absolutely forbidden for police officers particularly in possession of firearms to drink on duty they did not do so
3329688 the idea of them raiding my friends wine cellars then me asking them to pay for this is completely fictitious it is absurd the idea that they would lock me in a cupboard and go to the pub
3329689 this is not a free speech issue this is libel there is a difference between those two things i can defend the truth i will not have my character destroyed and presented to the world as something that it is not i am not trying to prevent him from publishing his stupid book but if they publish it as it is there will be consequences and there will be a libel action
3329690 it is not our intention to comment on ron evans recollection and interpretation of specific events we regret that he chooses to publish this book there were a number of passages within the draft which caused us concern following legal advice we negotiated with the publishers to make some alterations

3329700 he was right no student should have to compete against material that others cut and paste from the internet and submit as their own
